These models are trained on large amounts of text data and use statistical methods to learn patterns in language usage. LLMs have been used extensively in natural language processing (NLP) research, where they can be applied for tasks such as machine translation, speech recognition, sentiment analysis, question answering, and more. They are also being explored for applications outside of NLP, including text generation, summarization, and even image captioning."}], "created": 1692753592, "id": "foobarbaz", "model": "ggml-13B-HyperMantis.ggmlv3.q4_K_M.bin", "object": "text_completion", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 119, "prompt_tokens": 64, "total_tokens": 183}, "time": "52.18"}

Help as much as you can.\n\n### User:\nexplain use of Large Language Models (LLM) in AI research\n\n### Response:\n\n\nLarge language models, also known as pre-trained language models, are a type of artificial intelligence that have been trained on large amounts of text data. These models can be used for various natural language processing tasks such as machine translation, question answering and sentiment analysis. The most popular examples of these models include BERT (Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers), GPT-2 (Generative Pre-trained Transformer 2) and RoBERTa (Robustly Optimized BERT). These models are trained on large amounts of text data, such as Wikipedia or books, using a technique called unsupervised learning. This means that the model is not given any specific task to perform but instead learns from the data it has been provided with. The training process involves the model predicting the next word in a sequence based on the previous words and their context within the text. By doing this, the model can learn how sentences are constructed and what the meaning of different words is in relation to each other. Once trained, these models can be fine-tuned for specific tasks by adding additional layers or adjusting the weights of certain parts of the model. This allows them to perform well on a variety of natural language processing tasks without needing to be retrained from scratch. Large language models have revolutionized many areas of AI research and are widely used in industry as well as academia."}], "created": 1692753634, "id": "foobarbaz", "model": "ggml-13B-HyperMantis.ggmlv3.q4_K_M.bin", "object": "text_completion", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 293, "prompt_tokens": 69, "total_tokens": 362}, "time": "41.82"}

Help as much as you can.\n\n### User:\nexplain use of Large Language Models (LLM) in AI research\n\n### Response:\n\n\nLarge language models, also known as pre-trained language models, are a type of artificial intelligence that is used to analyze and understand human language. These models are trained on large amounts of text data using deep learning techniques such as neural networks. The goal of these models is to predict the next word in a sentence based on the previous words.\n\nThe most popular pre-trained language model is GPT, which stands for Generative Pre-Training Transformer. This model was developed by OpenAI and has been used extensively in natural language processing research. It can generate coherent text from prompts such as \"Write a story about a cat\" or answer questions like \"What is the capital of France?\"\n\nAnother popular pre-trained language model is BERT, which stands for Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers. This model was developed by Google and has been used in many NLP tasks such as text classification, sentiment analysis, and question answering. It can also generate coherent text from prompts like \"Write a story about a cat\" or answer questions like \"What is the capital of France?\"\n\nPre-trained language models have become an essential tool for AI researchers because they provide a strong baseline performance on many NLP tasks and allow researchers to focus on specific problems rather than spending time training their own models from scratch. These models can also be fine-tuned or adapted to new tasks by adding additional layers of neural networks, which allows them to perform even better on more complex tasks such as machine translation and text summarization."}], "created": 1692529842, "id": "foobarbaz", "model": "ggml-13B-HyperMantis.ggmlv3.q4_K_M.bin", "object": "text_completion", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 333, "prompt_tokens": 69, "total_tokens": 402}, "time": "48.87"}

Help as much as you can.\n\n### User:\nIn 8^X+2^X=130 show how to solve for X\n\n### Response:\n\n\nTo find the value of x, we need to isolate it on one side of the equation. We can do this by subtracting 8x from both sides and then dividing both sides by 2x. This gives us:130 = (8x - 8x) / 2x130 = 0We know that x is not equal to zero, so we need to find another way to solve for it. We can do this by taking the logarithm of both sides with base 2. This gives us:log(130) = -8x + 0Using a calculator or computer program, we can evaluate this expression and get x=4.975."}], "created": 1692530014, "id": "foobarbaz", "model": "ggml-13B-HyperMantis.ggmlv3.q4_K_M.bin", "object": "text_completion", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 150, "prompt_tokens": 71, "total_tokens": 221}, "time": "26.09"}

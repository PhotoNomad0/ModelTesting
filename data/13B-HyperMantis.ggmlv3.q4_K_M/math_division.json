Help as much as you can.\n\n### User:\nIn the morning, Emily decided to create some designs with her cereal bits. In total, she created 9 designs and used 63 cereal bits. About how many cereal bits were in each design? Do you think she used an equal number of cereal bits in each design?\n\n### Response:\n\n\nEmily's designs consisted of 9 pieces, so the average amount of cereal bits per piece is 63/9 = 7.00. However, it does not seem that she used an equal number of cereal bits in each design since some may have had more or less than others."}], "created": 1692753727, "id": "foobarbaz", "model": "ggml-13B-HyperMantis.ggmlv3.q4_K_M.bin", "object": "text_completion", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 66, "prompt_tokens": 117, "total_tokens": 183}, "time": "16.85"}

Help as much as you can.\n\n### User:\n25 - 4 * 2 + 3 = ?\nShow your work.\n\n### Response:\n\n\nTo solve this equation, we need to follow the order of operations (PEMDAS). First, let's perform any multiplication or division operations inside parentheses. Then, we can add and subtract as needed. In this case, there are no parentheses, so we will start with addition and subtraction. 25 + 4 = 31\nNext, we need to multiply and divide if necessary. Since the only number left is 31, it does not require any multiplication or division. Now that all of the operations have been performed, we can solve for the variable x: 31 - 4 * 2 + 3 = 31 - 8 + 3 = 26\nTherefore, the answer to the equation is 26."}], "created": 1692753836, "id": "foobarbaz", "model": "ggml-13B-HyperMantis.ggmlv3.q4_K_M.bin", "object": "text_completion", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 161, "prompt_tokens": 70, "total_tokens": 231}, "time": "25.41"}

So we have found two solutions to each equation. Let's call them y1 and y2.\nSubstituting one value of x into each equation from Step 1, we get:\nax^2 + by = c, so substituting y1 or y2 for y gives us:\nx^2 - (y1)^2/a = -(c-by)/a, and ax^2 + by = c, so substituting y1 or y2 for y gives us: x^2 - (y1)^2/a = 0.\nSolving these two equations for x we get: x = (-(c-by)/a) / sqrt(a), and x = 0.\nSo there are two solutions to the original equation, one is x = -(c-by)/a * sqrt(a), and the other is x = 0."}], "created": 1692753965, "id": "foobarbaz", "model": "ggml-13B-HyperMantis.ggmlv3.q4_K_M.bin", "object": "text_completion", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 437, "prompt_tokens": 101, "total_tokens": 538}, "time": "51.43"}

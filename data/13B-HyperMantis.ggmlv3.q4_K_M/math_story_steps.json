Help as much as you can.\n\n### User:\nIn Science class, Sara needed 8 test tubes for 3 different experiments. The first experiment required 2 test tubes and the other two experiments required the same number of test tubes. How many test tubes were needed for each of the other two experiments?\n\n### Response:\n\n\nSara needed a total of 8 test tubes, so she used 2 test tubes for one experiment and then had to use the same number of test tubes in the remaining two experiments. Since Sara only has 6 test tubes left after using 2 for the first experiment, this means that each of the other two experiments required 3 test tubes."}], "created": 1692753675, "id": "foobarbaz", "model": "ggml-13B-HyperMantis.ggmlv3.q4_K_M.bin", "object": "text_completion", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 77, "prompt_tokens": 108, "total_tokens": 185}, "time": "17.81"}

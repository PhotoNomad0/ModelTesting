The `display: flex;` property is used to enable Flexbox behavior on the parent div, and the `margin-right:` property is applied to each child element to space them out evenly along the right edge of their parent.\n\nYou can see this in action here: https://jsfiddle.net/m1L7jnqe/."}], "created": 1692754668, "id": "foobarbaz", "model": "ggml-13B-HyperMantis.ggmlv3.q4_K_M.bin", "object": "text_completion", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 151, "prompt_tokens": 74, "total_tokens": 225}, "time": "23.36"}

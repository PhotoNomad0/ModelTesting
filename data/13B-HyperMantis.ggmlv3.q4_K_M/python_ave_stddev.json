The formula for calculating the average is `average = sum(list) / len(list)`. \nTo calculate the standard deviation you can use the following code:\n```python\nimport numpy as np\ndef stdev(x):\n    n = len(x)\n    mean = x.mean()\n    variance = (np.var(x, ddof=1)) / ((n-1)*(n+2))\n    return abs(variance**0.5)\n```"}], "created": 1692754188, "id": "foobarbaz", "model": "ggml-13B-HyperMantis.ggmlv3.q4_K_M.bin", "object": "text_completion", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 131, "prompt_tokens": 65, "total_tokens": 196}, "time": "21.42"}

Help as much as you can.\n\n### User:\nSally is a girl with 3 brothers. Her brothers have 2 sisters. How many sisters does Sally have? Explain your answer\n\n### Response:\n\n\nYou are correct, the number of sisters that Sally has is 1. This can be explained by using a Venn diagram where each circle represents one family member and overlapping circles represent siblings within the same family. In this case, there are three brothers represented in the first circle with two sisters represented in the second circle. Since Sally is also represented in the third circle, she has no siblings of her own."}], "created": 1692753913, "id": "foobarbaz", "model": "ggml-13B-HyperMantis.ggmlv3.q4_K_M.bin", "object": "text_completion", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 90, "prompt_tokens": 83, "total_tokens": 173}, "time": "17.75"}

Calculate this step by step.\n\n### Response:\n\n\nLet's solve the problem together!\n1) When you were 6 years old, your sister was half of your age at that time. So she was 3 years old then.\n2) Now you are 80 years old.\n3) To find out how old your sister is now, we need to add her current age (which is 3 years old when you were 6) and the number of years that have passed since you were 6 until today (which is 74 years). So she would be: \nAge = 3 + 74 = 77 years old.\nTherefore, your sister is currently 77 years old!"}], "created": 1692529868, "id": "foobarbaz", "model": "ggml-13B-HyperMantis.ggmlv3.q4_K_M.bin", "object": "text_completion", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 143, "prompt_tokens": 86, "total_tokens": 229}, "time": "26.82"}

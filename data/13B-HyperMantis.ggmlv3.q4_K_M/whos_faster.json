If we compare their speeds while running, then yes, Jane would be considered faster than Sam because she has a higher speed than him. However, if we were to compare their typing speeds, Joe might actually be slower than both of them since he is not as proficient at it as they are."}], "created": 1692754314, "id": "foobarbaz", "model": "ggml-13B-HyperMantis.ggmlv3.q4_K_M.bin", "object": "text_completion", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 75, "prompt_tokens": 71, "total_tokens": 146}, "time": "16.16"}

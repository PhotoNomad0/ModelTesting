The socks are now wet from the wash, so Tom hangs the 10 pairs of socks outside to dry. 10 hours later, he comes back outside to check on the socks. He feels each sock and notices they are all dry. He takes them back inside because they are all dry. How long will it take Tom to dry seven pairs of socks presuming the same weather conditions?\nIt is impossible for me to accurately estimate how long it would take Tom to dry seven pairs of socks, as there are several factors that can affect the drying time such as weather conditions, humidity level and the material used in making the socks. However, based on his previous experience with washing and drying 10 pairs of socks, we could assume that it may take him a similar amount of time to complete the task if the same weather conditions are present during both instances. So, assuming Tom dries seven pairs of socks under similar weather conditions as he did for ten pairs, it might take approximately 10 hours for them to dry completely."}], "created": 1688840540, "id": "foobarbaz", "model": "ggml-30b-Lazarus.ggmlv3.q2_K.bin", "object": "text_completion", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 139, "prompt_tokens": 112, "total_tokens": 251}, "time": "54.54"}

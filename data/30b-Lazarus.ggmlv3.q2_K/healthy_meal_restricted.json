I can't have dairy, garlic, honey, almonds, pistachios, or cashews\nHere is a healthy meal plan that excludes dairy, garlic, honey, almonds, pistachios and cashews for today: \nBreakfast: Start your day with a protein-rich breakfast to keep you energized. Have scrambled eggs or oatmeal cooked in water without any milk or cream, served with fresh fruit such as berries or banana slices. Add some chia seeds for extra nutrition and fiber.\nLunch: For lunch, have a salad made of mixed greens, cherry tomatoes, cucumber slices, and grilled chicken breast seasoned with herbs like rosemary or thyme. Serve it with a side of quinoa cooked in water for added protein and nutrients.\nSnack: In between meals, have some carrot sticks or apple slices dipped in hummus made without tahini (sesame paste). This will provide you with healthy fats and fiber to keep your hunger at bay.\nDinner: For dinner, prepare a stir-fry dish using vegetables like broccoli, bell peppers, and carrots cooked in olive oil or avocado oil. Serve it over brown rice or quinoa for added nutrition. Add some tofu or tempeh for protein if desired.\nSnack: End the day with a cup of herbal tea like chamomile, which can help relax and calm your mind before bedtime.\nThis meal plan is designed to provide you with balanced nutrients and healthy food choices that exclude dairy, garlic, honey, almonds, pistachios or cashews.

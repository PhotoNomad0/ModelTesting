Simile: a figure of speech that compares two things using \"like\" or \"as,\" often to draw attention to their similarities. Example: She is as graceful as a dancer on the stage.\n2. Metaphor: a direct comparison between two unlike things, without using like or as, used to create an imaginative and vivid image. Example: The world is a stage, and all men and women merely players.\n3. Hyperbole: an exaggeration for emphasis or effect, often used in humor or to express strong emotion. Example: I'm so hungry I could eat a horse!\n4. Personification: giving human characteristics or emotions to non-human things, such as animals, objects or ideas. Example: The wind whispered through the trees.\n5. Alliteration: repetition of initial sounds in adjacent words for effect or emphasis. Example: She sells seashells by the seashore.\n6. Onomatopoeia: using a word that imitates the sound associated with it, often used to add emphasis or create an auditory image. Example: The clock ticked loudly in the silence.\n7. Irony: when there is a contrast between what is said and what is meant, often for humor or dramatic effect.\n8. Hypernym: using a broad term instead of a specific one to emphasize the similarities between two things. Example: She was an artist, not just a painter.\n9. Synecdoche: when a part represents the whole or vice versa, used for brevity or to create a more vivid image. Example: The entire team showed up on time.\n10. Metonymy: using one thing to represent another closely associated with it, often used for efficiency or effectiveness in communication. Example: He wore his crown of office."}], "created": 1689379026, "id": "foobarbaz", "model": "ggml-30b-Lazarus.ggmlv3.q2_K.bin", "object": "text_completion", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 421, "prompt_tokens": 24, "total_tokens": 445}, "time": "101.11"}

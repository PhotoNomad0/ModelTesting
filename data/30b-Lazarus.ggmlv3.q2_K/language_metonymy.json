This replacement can be used to create a more vivid and concise description, often conveying a deeper meaning or emotional impact than the original term would alone. For example, instead of saying \"I am thirsty,\" someone might say \"my throat is parched\" - both expressions convey the same idea but one uses a metonymic substitution (parched for thirsty)."}], "created": 1689378896, "id": "foobarbaz", "model": "ggml-30b-Lazarus.ggmlv3.q2_K.bin", "object": "text_completion", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 111, "prompt_tokens": 20, "total_tokens": 131}, "time": "29.85"}

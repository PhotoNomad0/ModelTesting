{"choices": [{"finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0, "logprobs": null, "references": [], "text": "what are the types of verbs?\nThere are several categories or classes of verbs based on their functions and behavior in a sentence. These include: \n1. Auxiliary Verbs: These are used to form tenses, negations, and interrogative sentences like \"do,\" \"did\" or \"is.\"\n2. Main Verbs: These are the primary action verbs that express the main event or activity in a sentence such as \"run,\" \"jump\" or \"sing.\"\n3. Modal Verbs: These are auxiliary verbs that indicate possibility, permission, obligation, ability or willingness like \"can,\" \"may,\" \"should\" or \"must.\"\n4. Dynamic Verbs: These are action verbs that express physical movement or activity such as \"jump,\" \"run\" or \"dance.\"\n5. Stative Verbs: These are verbs that describe a state, condition or situation rather than an action like \"be,\" \"seem\" or \"appear.\"\n6. Semi-auxiliary Verbs: These are auxiliary verbs used in the formation of complex verb forms such as \"have\" and \"do\" in the present perfect tense.\n7. Phrasal Verbs: These are composed of a verb plus a preposition or particle, and they express an action or state that is often difficult to convey with just one word like \"look up,\" \"put away\" or \"take over.\"\n8. Non-finite verbs: These include infinitives (to + base form), participles (present tense -ing / past tense -ed) and gerunds (noun form of the verb ending in -ing). They are used to express actions that can be completed or not, or as adjectives.\n9. Transitive Verbs: These require an object to complete their meaning, they transfer action from a subject to another entity like \"give,\" \"take\" or \"teach.\"\n10. Intransitive Verbs: These do not take an object and the action is completed within the sentence itself, such as \"laugh,\" \"sleep\" or \"walk\"."}], "created": 1689416401, "id": "foobarbaz", "model": "ggml-30b-Lazarus.ggmlv3.q2_K.bin", "object": "text_completion", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 451, "prompt_tokens": 21, "total_tokens": 472}, "time": "162.06"}

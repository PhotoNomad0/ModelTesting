In total, she created 9 designs and used 63 cereal bits. About how many cereal bits were in each design? Do you think she used an equal number of cereal bits in each design?\nEmily's designs are not described in detail so it is impossible to determine the exact number of cereals bits used in each design. However, based on the given information, Emily created a total of 9 designs and used a total of 63 cereal bits. This means that she could have used any combination of numbers of cereal bits per design as long as it adds up to a total of 63. It is possible that some designs may have had more or less cereals than others, but there's no way to determine the exact number without further information."}], "created": 1688839557, "id": "foobarbaz", "model": "ggml-30b-Lazarus.ggmlv3.q2_K.bin", "object": "text_completion", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 124, "prompt_tokens": 78, "total_tokens": 202}, "time": "49.28"}

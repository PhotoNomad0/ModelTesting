However, in this case, you have provided an equation that only contains terms up to second order. Here's the solution for the given equation ax^2+bx+c=d where a=1, b=0, c=-130 and d=-130:\n\nSolving Ax^2 + Bx + C = D, with A = 1, B = 0, C = -130, and D = -130 using the quadratic formula:\n\nGiven that there is no term of third order in this equation, we can use the quadratic formula to solve for x. The general form of the quadratic formula is:\n\nx = (-B +/- Sqrt(B^2-4AC)) / (2A)\nwhere A and C are the coefficients of the terms Ax^2 and Ax respectively in the equation, and B represents the constant term. In this case, we have:\n\nA = 1\nC = -130\nB = 0\nD = -130\n\nSubstituting these values into the quadratic formula, we get:\nx = (-0 +/- Sqrt(0^2-4(-1)*(-130))) / (2*1)\nx = (0 +/- Sqrt(0)) / (2*1)\nThis expression is undefined since 0 has no real square root, so there's no solution for x. This means that the given equation ax^2+bx+c=d where a=1, b=0, c=-130 and d=-130 does not have any solutions in the real number system."}], "created": 1688840061, "id": "foobarbaz", "model": "ggml-30b-Lazarus.ggmlv3.q2_K.bin", "object": "text_completion", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 374, "prompt_tokens": 62, "total_tokens": 436}, "time": "104.36"}

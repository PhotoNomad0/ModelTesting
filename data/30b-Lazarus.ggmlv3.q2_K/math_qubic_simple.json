Here is a step by step guide on how to find the solution using this method:\n\nStep 1: Rewrite the equation in the form of a cubic polynomial:\nx^3 + x - 130 = 0\nStep 2: Identify the discriminant, which is given by the formula D = (b^2-4ac)/(4a), where a, b and c are the coefficients of the equation. In this case, we have:\nD = (-1)^2 - 4*(-1)*130/4 = -9 * 130 / 4 = -1170\nStep 3: Determine if the discriminant is positive or negative to determine whether there are real solutions. Since D < 0, we know that there is no real solution for this equation.\nStep 4: If the discriminant is zero, then there is one real root and two complex roots. In our case, since D != 0, we cannot use Cardano's formula to find a solution.\n\nIn conclusion, using the Cardano's Formula, it is not possible to determine an exact value for x in this equation because the discriminant does not satisfy any of its conditions."}], "created": 1688840145, "id": "foobarbaz", "model": "ggml-30b-Lazarus.ggmlv3.q2_K.bin", "object": "text_completion", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 281, "prompt_tokens": 39, "total_tokens": 320}, "time": "83.99"}

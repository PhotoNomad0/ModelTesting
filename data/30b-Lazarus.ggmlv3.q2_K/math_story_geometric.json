She would fold five letter size pieces of paper three times then cut along the lines. She would then stack the smaller note papers and staple them together. How long would one notepad last if someone wrote ten notes per day?\nHarmony's notepads are made from 5 sheets of letter size paper, each sheet measuring approximately 8.5 x 11 inches in dimension. Assuming that the user writes a note on both sides of the paper and uses an average handwriting size, it is possible to write about 20 lines per page or so. Therefore, one notepad made from five sheets of paper can hold up to approximately 100 notes (5 x 20).\nIf someone wrote ten notes a day using Harmony's notepads, it would take them around two days to complete the entire pad and they would need another one. However, this is just an estimate based on average handwriting size and number of lines per page. The actual time taken may vary depending on individual writing style or note length.\nIn conclusion, a single Harmony's notepad made from five sheets of paper can last for approximately two days if someone writes ten notes per day using both sides of the paper."}], "created": 1688839456, "id": "foobarbaz", "model": "ggml-30b-Lazarus.ggmlv3.q2_K.bin", "object": "text_completion", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 211, "prompt_tokens": 78, "total_tokens": 289}, "time": "68.77"}

After he broke his arm, he had to use his left hand for a while, and he could only type 6 words per minute. What is the difference between the number of words he could type in 5 minutes before and after he broke his arm\nBefore Cam's injury, he was able to type 9 words/minute which means he can type (9 x 60) = 540 words in a minute. After the injury, when using only his left hand, he could type at a slower pace of 6 words per minute so over a period of 5 minutes he would be able to type (6 x 5) = 30 words. The difference between these two amounts is:\n540 - 30 = 510 words. This means that Cam's typing speed decreased by about 27% due to his injury."}], "created": 1688839508, "id": "foobarbaz", "model": "ggml-30b-Lazarus.ggmlv3.q2_K.bin", "object": "text_completion", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 133, "prompt_tokens": 86, "total_tokens": 219}, "time": "52.06"}

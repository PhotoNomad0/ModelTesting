The first experiment required 2 test tubes and the other two experiments required the same number of test tubes. How many test tubes were needed for each of the other two experiments?\nSure! Here's a logical approach to solve this problem:\n1) First, we know that Sara needs 8 test tubes in total and she has already used up 2 test tubes for the first experiment. So, there are now 6 remaining test tubes available.\n2) Since both of the other experiments require the same number of test tubes, let's say that each one requires x test tubes. Then we have:\nx + (x/2) = 6 where x is the number of test tubes required for each experiment and (x/2) represents the half portion used in the first experiment. Solving this equation gives us a solution of `x=4` since `(x/2)` equals `2`, so there are a total of `8-2 = 6` remaining test tubes available.\n3) Therefore, Sara needs to use `4` test tubes for each of the other two experiments, which means she has enough test tubes left over from the first experiment and doesn't need any more. The answer is `4`."}], "created": 1688839387, "id": "foobarbaz", "model": "ggml-30b-Lazarus.ggmlv3.q2_K.bin", "object": "text_completion", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 232, "prompt_tokens": 69, "total_tokens": 301}, "time": "84.97"}

Calculate this step by step.\nWhen you were six years old, your sister's age was half of yours or (6/2) = 3 years old. Now that you are 80 years old, her current age would be calculated as follows:\n- Her present age is the same difference between your ages when you were both younger and now that you have aged by a factor of two. So, subtracting half your age from your current age gives us (80 - (6/2)) = 74 years old.\nSo, her current age would be:\n- Her present age is the same difference between your ages when you were both younger and now that you have aged by a factor of two.

How old is my sister now?\nYour sister's current age can be calculated by subtracting your current age (80) from the fraction representing her original age when you were six years old and she was half your age, which would be `1/2`. So, her current age would be `(1/2)-(80-6)` or simply `44` since she is now 34 years older than when you were both the same ages."}], "created": 1689419321, "id": "foobarbaz", "model": "ggml-30b-Lazarus.ggmlv3.q2_K.bin", "object": "text_completion", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 89, "prompt_tokens": 40, "total_tokens": 129}, "time": "91.72"}

To solve this problem, we can use a simple rule of thumb that says for every pair of wet socks hung outside to dry in ideal conditions, it takes approximately 10 hours for them to completely dry. Based on this information, if Tom washed and dried 10 pairs of socks in 10 hours, then it would take him the same amount of time (10 hours) to dry seven pairs of socks under similar weather conditions.

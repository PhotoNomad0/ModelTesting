Here is an example of a JavaScript program that can be used to generate and print out the ASCII characters and their corresponding hexadecimal codes from 0 to 7F:
```javascript
for (let i = 0; i <= 7f; i++) {
    let charCode = String.fromCharCode(i);
    console.log(`ASCII character: ${charCode}`);
    console.log(`Hexadecimal code: ${i.toString(16)}`);
}
```
This program uses a for loop to iterate through the range of ASCII characters

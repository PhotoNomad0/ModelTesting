Here's one way to approach it:\n- First, let's simplify both sides of the equation by combining like terms on each side: \n- On the left hand side, we have a binomial expression that can be expanded using the Binomial Theorem: (a+b)^x = a^x + xab^(x-1) for any real number x. Applying this to our problem, we get: \n8^X + 2^X = 130\n- Now, let's combine like terms on the right", "index": 0, "logprobs": null, "finish_reason": "stop", "references": []}], "usage": {"prompt_tokens": 4096, "completion_tokens": 84, "total_tokens": 111, "thread_count": 4, "prompt_template": "\n### Instruction\nParaphrase the text below by expanding the words based on the subject\n### Human:\n%1\n### Assistant:\n"}, "time": "74.40"}

However, following this incident, when he had to use his non-dominant left hand for typing, his speed decreased significantly and he could only manage to input 6 words per minute. The difference between the number of words that Cam was able to type in a five-minute period before and after breaking his arm can be calculated by subtracting the slower rate (6) from the faster one (9), resulting in a difference of 3 words per minute",

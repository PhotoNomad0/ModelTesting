Here is an example Python code that can be used to solve the equation `ax^3 + bx^2 + c * x + d = 0` using Cardano's Formula and find all possible solutions for x:
```python
import math
a,b,c,d = [1,0,1,-130] # coefficients of the given equation
D = (b**2 - 4*a*c) / (4*a) # discriminant
if D < 0:
    print("No real solutions")
elif D == 0:

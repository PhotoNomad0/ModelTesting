The choice of a specific gauge was influenced by several factors such as local customs, terrain, and the desire to achieve interoperability between different networks. \nOne early example is the Roman Empire's use of a track width of about 4 feet (120 cm) for their roadways, which later became known as \"Roman gauge\" or \"Imperial Gauge.\" This standard was adopted by various European countries and eventually became popular in many parts of the world.\n",

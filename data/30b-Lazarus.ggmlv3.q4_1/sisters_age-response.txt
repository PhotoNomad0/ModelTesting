When you were 6 years old, your sister's age would have been (your age/2) + her actual age at that time. At the moment of writing, you are 80 years old and we don't know how much older she was when you were both younger. So it is not possible to calculate her current age based on this information alone. Could you please provide more details or specifics about your sister's age at that time?

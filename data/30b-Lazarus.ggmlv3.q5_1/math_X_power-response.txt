To solve for x in the equation 8^x + 2^x = 130, we can follow these steps:
1. First, let's simplify the expression on the left-hand side of the equation by combining like terms: (8^x) + (2^x) = 8*2^(x+1).
2. Next, we can factor out a common term from both sides of the equation to get rid of any unnecessary multiplication: (8*2^(x+1)) - 130 = 0.
3. Now that we have factored the

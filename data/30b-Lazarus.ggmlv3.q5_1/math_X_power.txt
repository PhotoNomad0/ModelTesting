First, let's simplify the expression on the left-hand side of the equation by combining like terms: (8^x) + (2^x) = 8*2^(x+1).\n2. Next, we can factor out a common term from both sides of the equation to get rid of any unnecessary multiplication: (8*2^(x+1)) - 130 = 0.\n3. Now that we have factored the",

To find the solution of the cubic equation ax³ + bx² + cx + d = 0 with a = 1, b = 0, c = 1, and d = -130 using Cardano's formula, we can follow these steps:
1. First, let's simplify the expression by rearranging it to have the standard form of ax³ + bx² + cx + d = 0 with a = 1, b = 0, c = 1 and d = -130: x³ + x - 130.

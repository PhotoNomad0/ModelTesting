To find the solution of the cubic equation x³ + x - 130 = 0 using Cardano's formula, we can follow these steps:
1. First, let's simplify the expression by rearranging it to have the standard form of ax³ + bx² + cx + d = 0 with a = 1, b = 0, c = 1 and d = -130: x³ + x - 130.
2. Next, we can use Cardano's formula to find the solution for x in terms of complex numbers. The

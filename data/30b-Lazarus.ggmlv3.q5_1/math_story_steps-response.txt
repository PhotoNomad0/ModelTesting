Sure! Here's a rephrased version of your text: In Science class, Sara had to perform 3 different experiments using test tubes. For the first experiment, she required 2 test tubes. The remaining experiments were identical in terms of their need for test tubes; they both needed the same number of test tubes.

Therefore, each of

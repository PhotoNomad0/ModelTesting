Calculate this step by step.\nTo calculate the age of your sister now, we need to first find out her current age.\n\nLet's start with the equation:\n\n6 / 2 = sister's age\n\nSimplifying this equation, we get:\n\n3 = sister's age\n\nNow we can solve for sister's age using the equation:\n\n3 / 2 = sister's age\n\nSimplifying this equation, we get:\n\n1.5 = sister's age\n\nMultiplying both sides of the equation by 2, we get:\n\n2 \\* 1.5 = sister's age\n\nSimplifying this equation, we get:\n\n3 = sister's age\n\nNow we can find out her current age using the equation:\n\ncurrent age = sister's age + 6\n\nSimplifying this equation, we get:\n\ncurrent age = 3 + 6\n\ncurrent age = 9\n\nSo your sister is currently 9 years old."}], "created": 1687956087, "id": "foobarbaz", "model": "GPT4All Falcon", "object": "text_completion", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 232, "prompt_tokens": 42, "total_tokens": 274}, "time": "33.81"}

write a JavaScript program to generate and print out the ascii character and hexadecimal codes for 0 to 7f
Here's an example Python program that generates and prints the ASCII character and hexadecimal code for each number from 0 to 7F:
```python
for i in range(8):
    print("ASCII Character:", chr(i))
    print("Hexadecimal Code:", format(i, 'X8'))
```

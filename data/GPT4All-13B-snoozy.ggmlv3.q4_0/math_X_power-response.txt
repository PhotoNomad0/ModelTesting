In 8^X+2^X=130 show how to solve for X
To solve the equation 2^X + X = 130, we need to find a way to isolate X on one side of the equation. Here are the steps to do so:

1. Start by multiplying both sides of the equation by 2^X:
2^X * (2^X + X) = 2^X * 130

2. Next, we can simplify this expression by using the fact that 2^X * 2^X = 2^(X+X):
2^(X+X) * 2^X * X = 2^X * 130

3. Now, we need to isolate X on one side of the equation:
2^X * (X + 1) = 130

4. Finally, we can solve for X by taking the logarithm of both sides and using the fact that log(a*b) = log(a) + log(b):
log(2^X * (X + 1)) = log(130)

5. Solving for X, we get:
log(2^X * (X + 1)) - log(130) = 0

6. Using a calculator or computer software to solve this equation, we find that the solution is approximately X = 4.789. Therefore, X â‰ˆ 4.789.

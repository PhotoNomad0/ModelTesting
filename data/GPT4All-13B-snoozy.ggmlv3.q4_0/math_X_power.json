Here are the steps to do so:\n\n1. Start by multiplying both sides of the equation by 2^X:\n2^X * (2^X + X) = 2^X * 130\n\n2. Next, we can simplify this expression by using the fact that 2^X * 2^X = 2^(X+X):\n2^(X+X) * 2^X * X = 2^X * 130\n\n3. Now, we need to isolate X on one side of the equation:\n2^X * (X + 1) = 130\n\n4. Finally, we can solve for X by taking the logarithm of both sides and using the fact that log(a*b) = log(a) + log(b):\nlog(2^X * (X + 1)) = log(130)\n\n5. Solving for X, we get:\nlog(2^X * (X + 1)) - log(130) = 0\n\n6. Using a calculator or computer software to solve this equation, we find that the solution is approximately X = 4.789. Therefore, X \u2248 4.789."}], "created": 1687343353, "id": "foobarbaz", "model": "GPT4All-13B-snoozy.ggmlv3.q4_0", "object": "text_completion", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 314, "prompt_tokens": 32, "total_tokens": 346}, "time": "126.03"}

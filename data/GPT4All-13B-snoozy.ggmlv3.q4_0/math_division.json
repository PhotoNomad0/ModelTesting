{"choices": [{"finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0, "logprobs": null, "references": [], "text": "In the morning, Emily decided to create some designs with her cereal bits. In total, she created 9 designs and used 63 cereal bits. About how many cereal bits were in each design? Do you think she used an equal number of cereal bits in each design?\nYes, I can help with that! To find out about how many cereal bits were in each design, we need to divide the total number of cereal bits by the number of designs. The result will be the average number of cereal bits used per design.\n\nFirst, let's calculate the total number of cereal bits: 63 + 63 = 126\n\nNow, we can divide that by the number of designs to find the average number of cereal bits used per design: 126 / 9 = 14.05\n\nSince it's not possible for an average to be a whole number, let's round down to the nearest integer: 14\n\nSo, on average, Emily used about 14 cereal bits in each design.\n\nTo answer your second question, I don't have enough information to determine whether or not she used an equal number of cereal bits in each design."}], "created": 1687342915, "id": "foobarbaz", "model": "GPT4All-13B-snoozy.ggmlv3.q4_0", "object": "text_completion", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 213, "prompt_tokens": 78, "total_tokens": 291}, "time": "25.81"}

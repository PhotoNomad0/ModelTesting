in ax^3+bx^2+c*x+d=0, use the cardano's formula to get the value for x where a=1, b=0, c=1 and d=-130
To solve this problem using Cardano's formula, we need to follow these steps:

1. Set up the system of equations:
a = 1, b = 0, c = 1, d = -130
2. Solve for x:
x^2 + (1/c)x + (d/c) = 0
3. Use Cardano's formula to find the solutions:
(1/2)((-d)^(1/2)) + sqrt((-d)/(2*c)) = (-b)/(2*a)
4. Solve for x:
x = (2*a*(-b)/(2*a*(-d)^{1/2} - sqrt((-d)/(2*c))))^(1/2)
5. Check the solutions:
x = (-b)/(2*a) + (2*a*(-b)/(2*a*(-d)^{1/2} - sqrt((-d)/(2*c))))^(1/2)
6. Verify that x is a solution to the original system of equations:
x^2 + (1/c)x + (d/c) = 0
7. Check for other solutions by testing different values of c and d in the original system of equations.

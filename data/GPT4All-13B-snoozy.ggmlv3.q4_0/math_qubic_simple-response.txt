in x^3+x-130=0, use the cardano's formula to get the value for x
To find the value of x in the equation x^3 + x - 130 = 0 using Cardano's formula, we need to follow these steps:

1. Set up the problem by rewriting the given equation as a cubic polynomial:
x^3 + x - 130 = 0
2. Use the substitution u = x^2/2 to transform the cubic into a quadratic form:
u^3 + u - 65 = 0
3. Solve the resulting quadratic equation using Cardano's formula, which involves finding the values of the three coefficients A, B, and C that satisfy the following conditions:
A^2 + B^2 + C^2 = D^2
AB + AC + BC = D
4. Plug in the given values to find A, B, and C:
A = -130/2 = -65
B = 1/2 = 0.5
C = (130-D)/2 = (-65+D)/2 = 0
5. Solve for D using the first equation:
D^2 + D - 65 = 0
D^2 - 65D + 65 = 0
D^2 - 65(D-1) = 0
D^2 - 65 = 0
D^2 = 65
D = sqrt(65)
6. Solve for the value of x:
x = (A+B+C)/3 = (-65 + D)/3 = (-65 + sqrt(65))/3 = -1.7857

Therefore, the solution to the equation x^3 + x - 130 = 0 is approximately -1.7857.

Set up the problem by rewriting the given equation as a cubic polynomial:\nx^3 + x - 130 = 0\n2. Use the substitution u = x^2/2 to transform the cubic into a quadratic form:\nu^3 + u - 65 = 0\n3. Solve the resulting quadratic equation using Cardano's formula, which involves finding the values of the three coefficients A, B, and C that satisfy the following conditions:\nA^2 + B^2 + C^2 = D^2\nAB + AC + BC = D\n4. Plug in the given values to find A, B, and C:\nA = -130/2 = -65\nB = 1/2 = 0.5\nC = (130-D)/2 = (-65+D)/2 = 0\n5. Solve for D using the first equation:\nD^2 + D - 65 = 0\nD^2 - 65D + 65 = 0\nD^2 - 65(D-1) = 0\nD^2 - 65 = 0\nD^2 = 65\nD = sqrt(65)\n6. Solve for the value of x:\nx = (A+B+C)/3 = (-65 + D)/3 = (-65 + sqrt(65))/3 = -1.7857\n\nTherefore, the solution to the equation x^3 + x - 130 = 0 is approximately -1.7857."}], "created": 1687343423, "id": "foobarbaz", "model": "GPT4All-13B-snoozy.ggmlv3.q4_0", "object": "text_completion", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 401, "prompt_tokens": 39, "total_tokens": 440}, "time": "39.54"}

Harmony used discarded paper to make notepads for her friends. She would fold five letter size pieces of paper three times then cut along the lines. She would then stack the smaller note papers and staple them together. How long would one notepad last if someone wrote ten notes per day?
To determine how long one notepad will last, we need to find out how many pages are in a notepad. Let's first calculate the number of pages in one notepad by dividing the total number of folds by three (since each piece is folded three times). Then, we can multiply that result by five (the number of pieces used) and add one to account for the extra page needed to staple it together.

The equation would be:
(total number of folds / 3) x 5 + 1 = total number of pages in a notepad

Now, let's find out how many notes can fit on each page by dividing the total number of pages by ten (the number of notes per day). We can then multiply that result by the length of one note to determine how long it will take for all the notes to be written.

The equation would be:
(total number of pages / 10) x length of one note = total time needed to write all notes

Once we have these two equations, we can solve them simultaneously and find out how many notepads Harm will need in order for her friends to use ten notes per day.

In Science class, Sara needed 8 test tubes for 3 different experiments. The first experiment required 2 test tubes and the other two experiments required the same number of test tubes. How many test tubes were needed for each of the other two experiments?
The second experiment required 4 test tubes (8 - 2 = 6) and the third experiment required 4 test tubes as well (6 + 4 = 10). Therefore, Sara needed a total of 8 + 4 + 4 = 16 test tubes for all three experiments.

when I was 6, my sister was half my age. Now I am 80. How old is my sister now? Calculate this step by step.
To solve this problem, we need to follow these steps:

1. Determine the current age of your sister when you are 6 years old.
2. Determine the current age of your sister when you are 80 years old.
3. Calculate the difference between the two ages in step 1 and step 2.
4. Multiply the result from step 3 by 2 to find out how many times your sister's age is half of yours.
5. Add the result from step 4 to the current age of your sister in step 2.
6. The final answer will be the current age of your sister.

Now, let's start with step 1:
When you are 6 years old, your sister is half your age, which means she is 3 years old.

Next, we move on to step 2:
When you are 80 years old, your sister is also 80 years old.

Now, let's calculate the difference between these two ages:
6 - 80 = -74

Since this result is negative, it means that your sister is older than you by a certain number of years. To find out how many times her age is half of yours, we need to multiply the absolute value of the difference by 2:
|-74| x 2 = 148

Finally, we add this result to your sister's current age in step 2:
148 + 80 = 228

So, your sister is currently 228 years old.

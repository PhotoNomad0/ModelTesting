      "text": "when I was 6, my sister was half my age. Now I am 80. How old is my sister now? Calculate this step by step.\nTo solve this problem, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. Determine the current age of your sister when you are 6 years old.\n2. Determine the current age of your sister when you are 80 years old.\n3. Calculate the difference between the two ages in step 1 and step 2.\n4. Multiply the result from step 3 by 2 to find out how many times your sister's age is half of yours.\n5. Add the result from step 4 to the current age of your sister in step 2.\n6. The final answer will be the current age of your sister.\n\nNow, let's start with step 1:\nWhen you are 6 years old, your sister is half your age, which means she is 3 years old.\n\nNext, we move on to step 2:\nWhen you are 80 years old, your sister is also 80 years old.\n\nNow, let's calculate the difference between these two ages:\n6 - 80 = -74\n\nSince this result is negative, it means that your sister is older than you by a certain number of years. To find out how many times her age is half of yours, we need to multiply the absolute value of the difference by 2:\n|-74| x 2 = 148\n\nFinally, we add this result to your sister's current age in step 2:\n148 + 80 = 228\n\nSo, your sister is currently 228 years old."

This literary device is often used to create emphasis, highlight paradoxes, or provide a dramatic effect in writing or speech. An example of a Hendiadys would be: \"War brings both peace and destruction.\" In this case, the two ideas seem contradictory, but the statement highlights the complexities and contradictions that can arise during wartime.", "role": "assistant"}}], "created": 1727100730, "model": "NousResearch/Hermes-2-Pro-Mistral-7B-GGUF/Hermes-2-Pro-Mistral-7B.Q4_0.gguf", "object": "chat.completion", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 136, "prompt_tokens": 36, "total_tokens": 172}, "time": "4.21"}

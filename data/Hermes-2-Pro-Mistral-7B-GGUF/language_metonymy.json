This substitution helps create meaning by association and can be used in both written and spoken language. It's a type of trope commonly found in literature, poetry, and everyday conversation.\n\nFor example, instead of saying \"the government,\" one might use the metonymy \"the White House\" to refer to the government, implying that the White House represents the government because it is the residence of the U.S. President and associated with government functions. Another common metonymy is \"The Crown\" for the British monarchy.\n\nIn essence, metonymy is a form of indirect reference that relies on the audience's understanding of the relationship between the term used and the thing it represents.", "role": "assistant"}}], "created": 1727100704, "model": "NousResearch/Hermes-2-Pro-Mistral-7B-GGUF/Hermes-2-Pro-Mistral-7B.Q4_0.gguf", "object": "chat.completion", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 189, "prompt_tokens": 35, "total_tokens": 224}, "time": "5.78"}

Each of these has its own set of tense variations. Here's a breakdown of the most common verb tenses in English:\n\n1. Present Tense:\n   - Simple Present: We use for habitual or general actions or states that are true now. Example: I walk to work every day.\n   - Present Continuous (Progressive): We use to show an action in progress at a specific time (usually the present). Example: She is walking to the store right now.\n\n2. Past Tense:\n   - Simple Past: We use for completed actions or states in the past. Example: He played soccer yesterday.\n   - Past Continuous (Progressive): We use to show an action in progress at a specific time in the past. Example: They were watching a movie when I arrived.\n   - Present Perfect: We use for actions that started in the past and continue to the present or for actions with unspecified time. Example: She has lived in New York for five years.\n   - Present Perfect Continuous: We use to show continuous action that began in the past and continues to the present. Example: They have been working on the project all day.\n\n3. Future Tense:\n   - Simple Future: We use for future actions or states with a specific time. Example: I will see you tomorrow.\n   - Future Continuous (Progressive): We use to show an action in progress at a specific time in the future. Example: They will be watching a movie together next week.\n   - Future Perfect: We use for actions that will be completed at a specific point in the future. Example: By this time next year, I will have finished college.\n   - Future Perfect Continuous: We use to show continuous action that will begin in the future and continue up to a specific point in the future. Example: By next summer, they will have been working on the project for five years.\n\nRemember that there are also other verb forms like present perfect continuous, past perfect continuous, and so on, but they are not as frequently used in everyday language.", "role": "assistant"}}], "created": 1727100745, "model": "NousResearch/Hermes-2-Pro-Mistral-7B-GGUF/Hermes-2-Pro-Mistral-7B.Q4_0.gguf", "object": "chat.completion", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 467, "prompt_tokens": 35, "total_tokens": 502}, "time": "14.27"}

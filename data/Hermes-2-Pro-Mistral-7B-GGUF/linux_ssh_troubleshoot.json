{"id": "chatcmpl-5r7rpj4d8932fghf6nyat", "choices": [{"finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0, "message": {"content": "The error \"Permission denied (publickey)\" typically occurs when the SSH key used in the command is not recognized by the server you're trying to connect to. This could be due to a few reasons:\n\n1. The SSH key file (UserKey.pem) doesn't exist, or its path is incorrect. Make sure the file exists at the specified location (~/UserKey.pem), and the path is correct. If you have the key stored in a different location, provide that full path instead.\n\n2. The SSH key is not properly generated or formatted. Ensure that the key was created correctly using the ssh-keygen command and is in OpenSSH format (.ssh/id_rsa and .ssh/id_rsa.pub for RSA keys, or .ssh/id_dsa and .ssh/id_dsa.pub for DSA keys).\n\n3. The SSH key pair is not associated with the server you're trying to connect to. You may need to add the public key (UserKey.pem) to the appropriate location on the server, usually in the ~/.ssh/authorized_keys file. However, if you are using AWS EC2 instance, it's better to use the 'authorize key pair' feature in the AWS console or AWS CLI to add your key pair to the instance's security group.\n\n4. The command is using an incorrect server address or hostname (ec2-34-221-131-108.us-west-2.compute.amazonaws.com). Verify that this is the correct address for the server you are trying to connect to. If it's not, use the correct one.\n\nPlease check these aspects and make sure everything is in order. If the issue persists, consult the AWS documentation or reach out to AWS support for further assistance.", "role": "assistant"}}], "created": 1727100770, "model": "NousResearch/Hermes-2-Pro-Mistral-7B-GGUF/Hermes-2-Pro-Mistral-7B.Q4_0.gguf", "object": "chat.completion", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 412, "prompt_tokens": 102, "total_tokens": 514}, "time": "12.96"}

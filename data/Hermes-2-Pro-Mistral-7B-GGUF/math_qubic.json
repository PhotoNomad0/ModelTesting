So our equation becomes:\n\nx^3 + 0x^2 + x - 130 = 0\n\nNow, we'll use Cardano's formula to find the roots of this equation. Cardano's formula is given by:\n\nx = (r \u00b1 \u221a(r\u00b2-s\u00b2))^(1/3) + t\n\nwhere r, s, and t are the coefficients obtained from rewriting the equation in the form x^3 + px + q = (x - r)(x - s)(x - t). In our case:\n\nx^3 + x - 130 = (x - r)(x - s)(x - t)\n\nBy comparing coefficients, we can determine that p = 0, q = -130, and the equation becomes:\n\n(x - r)(x - s)(x - t) = x^3 - (r + s + t)x^2 + (rs + rt + st)x - rst = x^3 - 130x\n\nSo now we can find r, s, and t:\n\nrt = q = -130\nrs = -p = 0\n\nSince there's no p in the equation, it means that rs+st+tr equals to 0. From the third equation, we have:\n\nr + s + t = 0\n\nNow we can use the first equation to find r:\n\nr\u00b2 - s\u00b2 = q/r = 130/r\n\nSince we don't know r, we'll leave this equation as is for now. Now let's consider t as the unknown variable and solve the third equation for t:\n\nt = -r - s\n\nSubstitute t in the second equation:\n\nr\u00b2 - (r + (-r - s))\u00b2 = 130/r\n\nSimplify this equation:\n\n2rs = 130/r\n\nNow we can substitute t from the third equation:\n\n2r(-r - s) = 130/r\n\nMultiplying both sides by r, we get:\n\n-2r\u00b2s = 130\n\nFrom the third equation again, r + s + t = 0, we can express s in terms of r and t:\n\ns = -r - t\n\nSubstitute s in the above equation:\n\n-2r\u00b2(-r - t) = 130\n\nSimplify this equation:\n\n2r\u00b3 + 2r\u00b2t = 130\n\nNow let's solve for t in terms of r:\n\nt = (130 - 2r\u00b3)/(2r\u00b2)\n\nSubstitute t back into the third equation to find s in terms of r:\n\ns = -r - ((130 - 2r\u00b3)/(2r\u00b2))\n\nNow we have s and t in terms of r:\n\ns = -r - ((130 - 2r\u00b3)/(2r\u00b2))\nt = (130 - 2r\u00b3)/(2r\u00b2)\n\nSubstitute these expressions for s and t back into the first equation:\n\nr\u00b2 - (-r - ((130 - 2r\u00b3)/(2r\u00b2)))\u00b2 = 130/r\n\nSimplify this equation:\n\nr\u00b2 - (r\u00b2 + 2(130 - 2r\u00b3)r + (130 - 2r\u00b3)\u00b2/(4r\u00b2)) = 130/r\n\nNow multiply both sides by r to get rid of the fraction:\n\nr\u00b3 - 2r\u00b3 + (130 - 2r\u00b3)\u00b2 = 130r\n\nSimplify this equation:\n\nr\u00b3 - 2r\u00b3 + 16900 - 4580r\u00b3 = 130r\n\nCombine like terms:\n\n-3r\u00b3 + 16900 = 130r\n\nNow isolate r\u00b3:\n\n3r\u00b3 = 16900 - 130r\n\nDivide both sides by 3:\n\nr\u00b3 = 5633.3333 - 43.3333r\n\nNow we can use numerical methods to approximate the value of r (note that this is a cubic equation in r, so it's not easy to find an exact value):\n\nr \u2248 -10.892\ns \u2248 10.892\nt \u2248 12.437\n\nNow we can use Cardano's formula to find the roots of the equation:\n\nx = (r \u00b1 \u221a(r\u00b2-s\u00b2))^(1/3) + t\n\nx \u2248 (-10.892 \u00b1 \u221a((-10.892)\u00b2 - (10.892)\u00b2))^(1/3) + 12.437\n\nSolving this equation, we get two complex roots and one real root:\n\nx1 \u2248 -0.546\nx2 \u2248 -1.861 \u00b1 0.983i\n\nSo the solutions for x are approximately:\n\nx1 = -0.546\nx2 \u2248 -1.861 \u00b1 0.983i", "role": "assistant"}}], "created": 1727100344, "model": "NousResearch/Hermes-2-Pro-Mistral-7B-GGUF/Hermes-2-Pro-Mistral-7B.Q4_0.gguf", "object": "chat.completion", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 1298, "prompt_tokens": 77, "total_tokens": 1375}, "time": "42.86"}

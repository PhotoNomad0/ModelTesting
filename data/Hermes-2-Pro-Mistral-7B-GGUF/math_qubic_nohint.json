However, these methods might not give an exact value for x due to rounding errors or complex roots.\n\nAnother approach is to try to factor the equation by finding integer roots using the Rational Root Theorem. The Rational Root Theorem states that if a polynomial has a rational root p/q (terminating decimal), then p is a factor of the constant term and q is a factor of the leading coefficient.\n\nIn our case, the constant term is -130, and the leading coefficient is 1. The factors of -130 are \u00b11, \u00b12, ..., \u00b165, and since the leading coefficient is 1, the possible rational roots are the factors of -130.\n\nWe can test these values to see if any of them are roots:\n\n1. -130 is not a root because (130)^3 + 130 - 130 = 657000, which is not 0.\n2. -65 is not a root because (-65)^3 + (-65) - 130 = -58980, which is not 0.\n3. -42 is not a root because (-42)^3 + (-42) - 130 = -7344, which is not 0.\n4. -35 is not a root because (-35)^3 + (-35) - 130 = -28965, which is not 0.\n5. -27 is not a root because (-27)^3 + (-27) - 130 = -11507, which is not 0.\n6. -20 is not a root because (-20)^3 + (-20) - 130 = -4980, which is not 0.\n7. -15 is not a root because (-15)^3 + (-15) - 130 = -4685, which is not 0.\n8. -12 is not a root because (-12)^3 + (-12) - 130 = -3764, which is not 0.\n9. -9 is not a root because (-9)^3 + (-9) - 130 = -3125, which is not 0.\n10. -7 is not a root because (-7)^3 + (-7) - 130 = -2186, which is not 0.\n11. -6 is not a root because (-6)^3 + (-6) - 130 = -1944, which is not 0.\n12. -5 is not a root because (-5)^3 + (-5) - 130 = -1705, which is not 0.\n13. -4 is not a root because (-4)^3 + (-4) - 130 = -1461, which is not 0.\n14. -3 is not a root because (-3)^3 + (-3) - 130 = -1247, which is not 0.\n15. -2 is not a root because (-2)^3 + (-2) - 130 = -1069, which is not 0.\n16. -1 is not a root because (-1)^3 + (-1) - 130 = -131, which is not 0.\n17. 1 is not a root because (1)^3 + (1) - 130 = -129, which is not 0.\n18. 65 is not a root because 65^3 + 65 - 130 = 43395, which is not 0.\n19. 130 is not a root because 130^3 + 130 - 130 = 2178750, which is not 0.\n\nSince none of the possible rational roots are actual roots of the equation, we must resort to numerical or graphical methods to approximate the real root(s). Using a numerical method such as the Newton-Raphson method, we find that the real root is approximately x \u2248 -4.813.", "role": "assistant"}}], "created": 1727100411, "model": "NousResearch/Hermes-2-Pro-Mistral-7B-GGUF/Hermes-2-Pro-Mistral-7B.Q4_0.gguf", "object": "chat.completion", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 1015, "prompt_tokens": 47, "total_tokens": 1062}, "time": "31.74"}

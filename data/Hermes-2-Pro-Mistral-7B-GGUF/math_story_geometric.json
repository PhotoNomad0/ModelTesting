To do this, we divide the total number of notes (16) by the number of notes used daily (10).\n\n16 notes / 10 notes per day = 1.6 days\n\nSo, one notepad created by Harmony would last for approximately 1.6 days if someone writes ten notes per day.", "role": "assistant"}}], "created": 1727100239, "model": "NousResearch/Hermes-2-Pro-Mistral-7B-GGUF/Hermes-2-Pro-Mistral-7B.Q4_0.gguf", "object": "chat.completion", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 319, "prompt_tokens": 92, "total_tokens": 411}, "time": "10.23"}

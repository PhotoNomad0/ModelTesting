Let's denote the number of test tubes needed for the first experiment as x, and the number needed for the other two experiments as y. We can set up an equation to represent this information:\n\nx + y + y = 8\n\nSince the first experiment required 2 test tubes, we know x = 2. Now we have:\n\n2 + y + y = 8\n\nCombine the 'y' terms:\n\n2 + 2y = 8\n\nNow, solve for 'y':\n\n2y = 6\ny = 3\n\nThe other two experiments required 3 test tubes each.", "role": "assistant"}}], "created": 1727100234, "model": "NousResearch/Hermes-2-Pro-Mistral-7B-GGUF/Hermes-2-Pro-Mistral-7B.Q4_0.gguf", "object": "chat.completion", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 157, "prompt_tokens": 83, "total_tokens": 240}, "time": "4.99"}

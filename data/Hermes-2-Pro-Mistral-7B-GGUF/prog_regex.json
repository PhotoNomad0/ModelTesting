This ensures we capture exactly three characters for the code and don't include any additional characters before the dot.\n3. `(?:[A-Za-z0-9]+\\.)+` - Matches one or more characters that can be either upper or lower case letters or digits, followed by a dot. This part is responsible for matching everything before the \".usfm\" extension.\n4. `usfm` - Matches the exact characters \"usfm\" as the filename extension.\n5. `$` - Ensures the regex expression matches until the end of the line (filename).", "role": "assistant"}}], "created": 1727100843, "model": "NousResearch/Hermes-2-Pro-Mistral-7B-GGUF/Hermes-2-Pro-Mistral-7B.Q4_0.gguf", "object": "chat.completion", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 290, "prompt_tokens": 84, "total_tokens": 374}, "time": "8.97"}

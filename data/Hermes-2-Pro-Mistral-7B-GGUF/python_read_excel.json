First, make sure to install the package if you haven't already:\n\n```bash\npip install pandas\n```\n\nNow, you can create a function that reads data from an Excel file. Here's an example of how you might do this:\n\n```python\nimport pandas as pd\n\ndef read_excel(filepath: str, sheet_name: str = 'Sheet1') -> pd.DataFrame:\n    \"\"\"\n    Read data from an Excel spreadsheet using the pandas library.\n    \n    Args:\n        filepath (str): The path to the Excel file.\n        sheet_name (str, optional): The name of the sheet to read. Default is 'Sheet1'.\n        \n    Returns:\n        pd.DataFrame: The data from the specified Excel spreadsheet as a pandas DataFrame.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Read the Excel file into a pandas DataFrame\n    df = pd.read_excel(filepath, sheet_name=sheet_name)\n    \n    return df\n```\n\nYou can use this function to read data from an Excel file by providing the file path and the sheet name (optional). For example:\n\n```python\n# Provide the file path and sheet name\nfilepath = 'sample.xlsx'\nsheet_name = 'Sheet1'\n\n# Read the data and print it\ndf = read_excel(filepath, sheet_name)\nprint(df)\n```\n\nMake sure you have an Excel file named `sample.xlsx` in the same directory as your Python script for this example to work correctly.", "role": "assistant"}}], "created": 1727100495, "model": "NousResearch/Hermes-2-Pro-Mistral-7B-GGUF/Hermes-2-Pro-Mistral-7B.Q4_0.gguf", "object": "chat.completion", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 394, "prompt_tokens": 41, "total_tokens": 435}, "time": "11.94"}

It uses the `re.search()` method to search for a pattern that matches three consecutive characters (uppercase letters, lowercase letters, or digits), followed by any number of other characters and the \".usfm\" extension. The parentheses in the regular expression capture the three-character code for extraction with `match.group(1)`.\n\nNote that this function will only find exactly three consecutive characters followed by \".usfm\", and won't match if there are more or fewer than three characters before the extension. If you need to handle different filename formats, please provide more specific requirements for modification.", "role": "assistant"}}], "created": 1727100874, "model": "NousResearch/Hermes-2-Pro-Mistral-7B-GGUF/Hermes-2-Pro-Mistral-7B.Q4_0.gguf", "object": "chat.completion", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 291, "prompt_tokens": 97, "total_tokens": 388}, "time": "9.04"}

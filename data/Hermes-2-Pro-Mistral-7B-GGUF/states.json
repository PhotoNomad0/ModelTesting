Here's an example of how to generate this CSV using Python:\n\n```python\nimport csv\n\nstates = [\n    {'name': 'Alabama', 'joined': 1819, 'capital': 'Montgomery'},\n    {'name': 'Alaska', 'joined': 1959, 'capital': 'Juneau'},\n    {'name': 'Arizona', 'joined': 1912, 'capital': 'Phoenix'},\n    # ... and the rest of the states\n]\n\nwith open('states.csv', 'w', newline='') as file:\n    fieldnames = ['state_name', 'year_joined', 'capital']\n    writer = csv.DictWriter(file, fieldnames=fieldnames)\n    \n    writer.writeheader()  # Writes the header row\n    \n    for state in states:\n        writer.writerow(state)\n```\n\nAfter running this script, a 'states.csv' file will be created in your current directory with the following content:\n\n```\nstate_name,year_joined,capital\nAlabama,1819,Montgomery\nAlaska,1959,Juneau\nArizona,1912,Phoenix\n...\n```\n\nNote that this code assumes you have a list of states with their respective information. If such a list is not available, you'll need to gather the data and populate the 'states' list accordingly before running the script.", "role": "assistant"}}], "created": 1727100585, "model": "NousResearch/Hermes-2-Pro-Mistral-7B-GGUF/Hermes-2-Pro-Mistral-7B.Q4_0.gguf", "object": "chat.completion", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 398, "prompt_tokens": 52, "total_tokens": 450}, "time": "12.26"}

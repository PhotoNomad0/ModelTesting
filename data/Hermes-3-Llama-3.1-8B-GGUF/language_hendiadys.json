It is used to add emphasis or create a more vivid description.\n\nHere's an example of hendiadys:\n\n\"He was full of wisdom and knowledge.\"\n\nIn this sentence, \"wisdom\" and \"knowledge\" are two distinct concepts, but together they form a single idea that describes the person's intelligence. It could be rewritten as:\n\n\"He was full of wisdom.\"\n\nHowever, using both words adds emphasis to the description. Other examples include:\n\n- She was filled with joy and delight.\n- The city was famous for its beauty and grace.\n- He had a heart full of love and compassion.\n\nHendiadys is similar to another rhetorical device called hypophora, which involves asking a question and then immediately answering it.", "role": "assistant"}}], "created": 1728671267, "model": "hermes-3-llama-3.1-8b", "object": "chat.completion", "system_fingerprint": "hermes-3-llama-3.1-8b", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 186, "prompt_tokens": 31, "total_tokens": 217}, "time": "7.67"}

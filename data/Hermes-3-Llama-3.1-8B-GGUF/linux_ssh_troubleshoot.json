Ensure that the path to your private key file (\"~/UserKey.pem\") is correct and accessible. Double-check the spelling and ensure that the file exists in the specified location.\n\n2. Verify that the permissions of the private key file allow SSH to read it. The file should have its permissions set to 600 (read and write for the owner, no access for others). You can change the permissions using the following command:\n\n   ```\n   chmod 600 \"~/UserKey.pem\"\n   ```\n\n3. Check if the SSH key pair is properly generated and contains valid key information.\n\n4. Ensure that you have configured your AWS EC2 instance to accept public key-based authentication. When launching an EC2 instance, you can specify a key pair during the launch process or after the instance is running by modifying its security group settings.\n\n5. If you are using a different SSH key than the one specified in the EC2 instance's metadata (either through user data or launched with a specific key pair), make sure that the key pair associated with your EC2 instance matches the private key file you are using for the SSH command.\n\n6. Double-check that the remote EC2 instance's security group settings allow inbound SSH access from your current IP address or any required source IP range.\n\nIf none of the above steps resolve the issue, please provide more details about your setup, such as how you launched the EC2 instance and any relevant configuration files. This will help in identifying the root cause of the problem.", "role": "assistant"}}], "created": 1728671323, "model": "hermes-3-llama-3.1-8b", "object": "chat.completion", "system_fingerprint": "hermes-3-llama-3.1-8b", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 381, "prompt_tokens": 73, "total_tokens": 454}, "time": "16.62"}

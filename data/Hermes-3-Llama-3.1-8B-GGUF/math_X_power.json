Let's substitute 2^X with a variable, say Y.\n\nStep 1: Substitute 2^X with Y\n8^X + 2^X = 130\n8^X + Y = 130\n\nNow, we have two separate equations:\n1) 2^X = Y\n2) 8^X + Y = 130\n\nStep 2: Solve for X in equation (1)\n2^X = Y\nTo solve this, we can take the logarithm of both sides. Let's use base 4 as it is a common factor of 2 and 8.\n\nlog\u2084(2^X) = log\u2084(Y)\nX * log\u2084(2) = log\u2084(Y)\n\nSince log\u2084(2) = 1, we have:\nX = log\u2084(Y)\n\nStep 3: Substitute X in equation (2)\n8^X + Y = 130\n8^(log\u2084(Y)) + Y = 130\n\nStep 4: Simplify the equation\nY + Y = 130\n2Y = 130\nY = 65\n\nStep 5: Solve for X using the value of Y\nFrom step 1, we have 2^X = Y.\nSo, 2^X = 65\n\nNow, we need to find the value of X that satisfies this equation. We can use trial and error or logarithms to find an approximate value.\n\nUsing trial and error:\nWe know that 2^6 = 64 (which is less than 65) and 2^7 = 128 (which is greater than 65). Therefore, we can assume that X is between 6 and 7.\n\nUsing logarithms:\nlog\u2082(65) \u2248 6.298\n\nSince log\u2082(65) is closer to 6 than it is to 7, we can approximate that X \u2248 6.\n\nTherefore, the solution for the equation 8^X + 2^X = 130 is approximately X = 6. However, this solution might not be exact due to the approximation in the logarithm calculation.", "role": "assistant"}}], "created": 1728670747, "model": "hermes-3-llama-3.1-8b", "object": "chat.completion", "system_fingerprint": "hermes-3-llama-3.1-8b", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 463, "prompt_tokens": 41, "total_tokens": 504}, "time": "19.33"}

Let's solve this step by step.\n\nStep 1: Identify possible rational roots using the rational root theorem.\nThe possible rational roots are given by:\n\u00b1(factor of 130) \u00f7 (power of coefficient of last term)\n\u00b11, \u00b12, \u00b15, \u00b110, \u00b113, \u00b126, \u00b165, \u00b1130\n\nStep 2: Test each possible rational root using synthetic division.\n\nTesting x = 1:\n1 | 1   1    0\n   | 1  2    -1\n   ------------\n     1  2   -1\n\nSince there is no remainder, x = 1 is a root of the equation. Now we can divide the polynomial by (x - 1) using synthetic division:\n\n1 | 1   1    0\n   | 1  2    -1\n   ------------\n     1  2   -1\n\nDividing each term in x^3 + x - 130 by (x - 1), we get:\n(x^3 + x - 130) \u00f7 (x - 1) = x^2 + x - 1\n\nThe remaining quadratic equation is x^2 + x - 1 = 0. We can solve this using the quadratic formula:\n\nx = [-b \u00b1 \u221a(b\u00b2 - 4ac)] / 2a\na = 1, b = 1, and c = -1\n\nx = [-1 \u00b1 \u221a(1\u00b2 - 4(1)(-1))] / 2(1)\nx = (-1 \u00b1 \u221a5) / 2\n\nTherefore, the solutions for x in the equation x^3 + x - 130 = 0 are:\nx = 1\nx = (-1 + \u221a5) / 2 \u2248 0.618\nx = (-1 - \u221a5) / 2 \u2248 -1.618", "role": "assistant"}}], "created": 1728670856, "model": "hermes-3-llama-3.1-8b", "object": "chat.completion", "system_fingerprint": "hermes-3-llama-3.1-8b", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 432, "prompt_tokens": 40, "total_tokens": 472}, "time": "17.72"}

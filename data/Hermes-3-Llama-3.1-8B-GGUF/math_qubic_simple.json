Let y = x - b/3, where b is a constant that will be determined later.\n\nSubstituting y into the original equation:\n(y + b/3)^3 + (y + b/3) - 130 = 0\n\nExpanding and simplifying:\ny^3 + (b/3)y^2 + (b^2/9)y + (b^3/27) + y + b/3 - 130 = 0\ny^3 + (b/3)y^2 + (b^2/9)y + (b^3/27) + (3y+b)/3 - 130 = 0\n\nNow, we can equate the coefficients of like powers of y on both sides:\nA = b^3 / 27\nB = (b^2) / 9\nC = (3b + 1) / 3\nD = -130\n\nPlugging these values into Cardano's formula for cubic equations:\n\nx = cube_root(-A/2 + sqrt((A/2)^2 - B)) - b/3\n   = cube_root((-b^3 / 54) + sqrt(((b^3 / 54)^2) - (b^2 / 9)))\n   = cube_root(b^3/27 - sqrt(b^6/729 - b^2 / 9))\n   = cube_root(b^3/27 - b^sqrt(64)/18)\n   = cube_root((b(b^2 - 8)/18))\n\nSince the constant term is -130, let's set D = -130:\n-130 = (x^3) + x - (4/27)b^3\n\nTo find the value of b, we can choose a value that simplifies the equation. Let's take b = 9:\n\n-130 = (x^3) + x - (4/27)(9)^3\n-130 = (x^3) + x - (4/27)(729)\n-130 = x^3 + x - 108\n\nNow, we have a depressed cubic equation:\nx^3 + x - 238 = 0\n\nUsing the substitution y = x - 9/3, we get the original equation back:\n(x - 3)^3 + (x - 3) - 130 = 0\nx^3 + x - 130 = 0\n\nHowever, this doesn't give us a real solution for x. Since the problem involves finding roots of a cubic equation using Cardano's formula, and the given equation is not solvable by radicals, it suggests that the original problem statement might be incorrect or incomplete. In reality, there are no real solutions to the equation x^3 + x - 130 = 0, as it has one real root and two complex roots.", "role": "assistant"}}], "created": 1728670830, "model": "hermes-3-llama-3.1-8b", "object": "chat.completion", "system_fingerprint": "hermes-3-llama-3.1-8b", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 630, "prompt_tokens": 46, "total_tokens": 676}, "time": "25.78"}

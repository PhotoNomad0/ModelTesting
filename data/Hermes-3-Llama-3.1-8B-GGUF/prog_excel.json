Replace \"A1\" with the cell reference containing the content you want to copy.\n2. The SUBSTITUTE function takes three arguments: the original text (A1), the old text to be replaced (''), and the new text to replace it with (\"\").\n3. By passing an empty string ('') as the second argument, you effectively remove all instances of single quotes from the cell's contents.\n\nFor example, if your original content is in cell A1 and looks like this: \"John 'O'Connor\", using the formula =SUBSTITUTE(A1,\"'\",\"\") will result in \"John O'Connor\".\n\nRemember to adjust the cell reference (A1) based on where your actual data is located.", "role": "assistant"}}], "created": 1728671364, "model": "hermes-3-llama-3.1-8b", "object": "chat.completion", "system_fingerprint": "hermes-3-llama-3.1-8b", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 182, "prompt_tokens": 42, "total_tokens": 224}, "time": "7.91"}

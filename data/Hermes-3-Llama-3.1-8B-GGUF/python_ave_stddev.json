We import the `numpy` library as `np` to use its statistical functions.\n\n2. We define a function called `calculate_stats` that takes a list of numbers as input.\n\n3. Inside the function, we calculate the average (mean) by summing up all the numbers in the list using the `sum()` function and dividing it by the length of the list (`len(numbers)`).\n\n4. To calculate the standard deviation, we use the `np.std()` function from the NumPy library. This function calculates the standard deviation of the numbers in the list.\n\n5. The function returns both the average and the standard deviation as output.\n\n6. In the example usage, we create a list of numbers called `numbers`.\n\n7. We call the `calculate_stats` function with the `numbers` list and unpack the returned values into `average` and `std_dev`.\n\n8. Finally, we print the calculated average and standard deviation using formatted strings.\n\nOutput:\n```\nAverage: 5.5\nStandard Deviation: 2.8722813232690143\n```\n\nNote that this code uses NumPy's `np.std()` function to calculate the standard deviation efficiently. Make sure you have NumPy installed in your Python environment (`pip install numpy`) before running the code.", "role": "assistant"}}], "created": 1728671027, "model": "hermes-3-llama-3.1-8b", "object": "chat.completion", "system_fingerprint": "hermes-3-llama-3.1-8b", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 411, "prompt_tokens": 37, "total_tokens": 448}, "time": "16.98"}

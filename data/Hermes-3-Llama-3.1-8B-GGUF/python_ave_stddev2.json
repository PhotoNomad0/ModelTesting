It takes a list of numbers as input.\n\n2. It calculates the average by summing up all the numbers and dividing by the count of numbers in the list.\n\n3. It calculates the squared differences between each number and the calculated average using a list comprehension.\n\n4. It calculates the variance by summing up the squared differences and dividing by the count of numbers.\n\n5. It calculates the standard deviation by taking the square root of the variance using `math.sqrt()`.\n\n6. Finally, it returns the calculated average and standard deviation.\n\nIn the example usage, we provide a list of numbers `[1, 2, 3, 4, 5]` to the function. The function calculates the average and standard deviation of these numbers and prints the results rounded to two decimal places using an f-string with the `:.2f` format specifier.\n\nOutput:\n```\nAverage: 3.00\nStandard Deviation: 1.58\n```", "role": "assistant"}}], "created": 1728671044, "model": "hermes-3-llama-3.1-8b", "object": "chat.completion", "system_fingerprint": "hermes-3-llama-3.1-8b", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 375, "prompt_tokens": 40, "total_tokens": 415}, "time": "15.51"}

Here's a Python program that solves for all possible values of x:\n\n```python\nimport cmath\n\ndef solve_cubic(a, b, c, d):\n    # Calculate the discriminant\n    p = (b**2 - 3*a*c)\n    q = (2*b**3 - 9*a*b*c + 27*a**2*d)\n\n    # Find the roots using Cardano's formula\n    disc = -(p**3)/q\n    t = math.sqrt(disc)\n    x1 = (-b/3) + ((t**(1/3)) + (t**(-1/3))) / 2\n    x2 = (-b/3) - ((t**(1/3)) - (t**(-1/3))) / 2\n\n    # Calculate the remaining roots using Vieta's formulas\n    x3 = (c/a - b/(3*a) * x1 - b/(3*a) * x2)\n    x4 = c/a - b/(3*a) * x1 - b/(3*a) * x2\n\n    return [x1, x2, x3, x4]\n\n# Example usage\na = 1\nb = 0\nc = 0\nd = -8\n\nroots = solve_cubic(a, b, c, d)\nprint(\"The roots of the cubic equation are:\")\nfor root in roots:\n    print(root)\n```\n\nIn this program:\n\n1. We define a function called `solve_cubic` that takes the coefficients a, b, c, and d as parameters.\n\n2. Inside the function, we calculate the discriminant using the formulas p = (b\u00b2 - 3ac) and q = (2b\u00b3 - 9abc + 27a\u00b2d).\n\n3. We then find the roots using Cardano's formula and Vieta's formulas. The first two roots (x1 and x2) are found using Cardano's formula, while the remaining roots (x3 and x4) are calculated using Vieta's formulas.\n\n4. Finally, we return a list containing all four roots of the cubic equation.\n\nIn the example usage section:\n\n1. We set the values of a, b, c, and d according to the given cubic equation.\n\n2. We call the `solve_cubic` function with these coefficients and store the returned roots in a list called `roots`.\n\n3. We print each root from the `roots` list.\n\nNote: This program assumes that all four roots are distinct. If there are duplicate or complex roots, additional handling may be required.\n\nAlso, keep in mind that the cubic equation you provided (ax\u00b3 + bx\u00b2 + cx + d = 0) does not have x terms (i.e., no x term).

You can install it using pip:\n\n```\npip install openpyxl\n```\n\nHere's an example of how to call the function and access the data from the spreadsheet:\n\n```python\nfile_path = \"path/to/your/excel/file.xlsx\"\nsheet_name = \"Sheet1\"\n\ndata = read_spreadsheet(file_path, sheet_name)\n\n# Access the data\nfor row in data:\n    print(row)\n```\n\nThis code assumes that you have an Excel file named `excel_file.xlsx` in the specified path and a worksheet named `\"Sheet1\"` within that file. The function reads the data from the specified sheet and returns a list of rows, where each row is another list containing the cell values.\n\nNote: Make sure to replace `\"path/to/your/excel/file.xlsx\"` with the actual path to your Excel file and `\"Sheet1\"` with the name of the worksheet you want to read from.", "role": "assistant"}}], "created": 1728670972, "model": "hermes-3-llama-3.1-8b", "object": "chat.completion", "system_fingerprint": "hermes-3-llama-3.1-8b", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 439, "prompt_tokens": 33, "total_tokens": 472}, "time": "17.89"}

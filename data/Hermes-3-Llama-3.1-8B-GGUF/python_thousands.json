This is done using the built-in `str.format()` method in Python.\n- After adding the commas, we remove any trailing zeros and decimal points using two calls to the `rstrip()` method. The first `rstrip(\"0\")` removes trailing zeros from the right side of the formatted string, and the second `rstrip(\".\")` removes any remaining decimal point if there are no more digits after it.\n\nExample usage:\n```python\nprint(format_number(1234567890))  # Output: $1,234,567,890\nprint(format_number(1234.5678))   # Output: $1,234.57\nprint(format_number(1000000))      # Output: $1,000,000\n```\n\nIn the above examples:\n- The number `1234567890` is formatted as `$1,234,567,890`.\n- The number `1234.5678` is formatted as `$1,234.57`.\n- The number `1000000` is formatted as `$1,000,000`.\n\nThe function handles both integer and floating-point numbers and adds commas as thousands separators accordingly.", "role": "assistant"}}], "created": 1728671464, "model": "hermes-3-llama-3.1-8b", "object": "chat.completion", "system_fingerprint": "hermes-3-llama-3.1-8b", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 345, "prompt_tokens": 57, "total_tokens": 402}, "time": "14.67"}

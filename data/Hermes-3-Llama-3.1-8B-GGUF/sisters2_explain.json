We know that Sally has 3 brothers, which means there are 4 children in her family (Sally + 3 brothers).\n2. Her brothers collectively have 2 sisters. Here we need to understand that \"sisters\" refers to the number of siblings who are female.\n3. Since we already know Sally is one of these sisters (as she's a girl), and we've established there are 4 children in her family, there can only be 1 other sister besides Sally.\n\nSo, Sally has 1 sister.\n\nThe confusion might come from thinking \"sisters\" refers to the number of siblings who are girls. However, it's talking about how many sisters Sally's brothers collectively have (which doesn't change the fact that Sally is one of those sisters).", "role": "assistant"}}], "created": 1728670806, "model": "hermes-3-llama-3.1-8b", "object": "chat.completion", "system_fingerprint": "hermes-3-llama-3.1-8b", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 165, "prompt_tokens": 51, "total_tokens": 216}, "time": "6.82"}

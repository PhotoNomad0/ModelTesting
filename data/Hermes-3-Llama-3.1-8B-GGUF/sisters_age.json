To find out how many years have passed:\n80 (your current age) - 6 (your age when your sister was half your age) = 74 years\n\nStep 3: Determine your sister's current age by adding the number of years that have passed since you were 6 to her original age difference.\nYour sister is currently 3 years younger than you. Since you are now 80, we subtract the age difference:\n80 (your current age) - 3 (age difference when you were 6) = 77\n\nTherefore, your sister is currently 77 years old.", "role": "assistant"}}], "created": 1728670674, "model": "hermes-3-llama-3.1-8b", "object": "chat.completion", "system_fingerprint": "hermes-3-llama-3.1-8b", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 207, "prompt_tokens": 56, "total_tokens": 263}, "time": "8.55"}

Since Tom has already hung 10 pairs of socks outside, we can assume that the weather conditions are suitable for drying.\n\nAssuming an average ambient temperature of 20\u00b0C (68\u00b0F) and moderate humidity, I would estimate the time it takes to dry a pair of socks using a simple inverse square law approach.\n\n**Calculation**\n---------------\n\nLet's assume that the evaporation rate of water from the sock surface is constant. The drying time can be estimated as follows:\n\nDrying Time \u2248 (Sock Thickness / Evaporation Rate) \u00d7 \u221a(Air Circulation)\n\nUsing rough estimates, I propose a drying time of approximately 6-8 hours for one pair of socks.\n\n**Input**\n---------\n\n* Drying time for one pair of socks: 6-8 hours\n* Number of pairs to dry: 7\n\n### Expert 2: Ryan\n-----------------\n\n**Building upon Emma's Idea**\n------------------------------\n\nEmma's estimate seems reasonable, but we need to consider the total surface area of the socks. Since each sock has a diameter of approximately 10 cm (4 in), let's assume that the evaporation rate is directly proportional to the square root of the total surface area.\n\nUsing the inverse square law, I would revise Emma's estimate as follows:\n\nDrying Time \u2248 \u221a(Sock Surface Area) \u00d7 Evaporation Rate\n\nAssuming an average air circulation speed of 1 m/s (3.6 ft/s), I propose a drying time of approximately 8-12 hours for seven pairs of socks.\n\n**Input**\n---------\n\n* Drying time for one pair of socks: Emma's estimate (6-8 hours)\n* Evaporation Rate: assumed constant\n* Number of pairs to dry: 7\n\n### Expert 3: Sophia\n------------------\n\n**Refining the Estimate**\n------------------------\n\nRyan's revised estimate is closer to my own expectations. However, I'd like to consider an additional factor \u2013 the drying time can vary depending on the initial moisture content of the socks.\n\nLet's assume that the initial moisture content is around 80% for a washed sock. Using a more detailed evaporation model, I propose a drying time of approximately 10-14 hours for seven pairs of socks.\n\n**Input**\n---------\n\n* Drying time for one pair of socks: Ryan's estimate (8-12 hours)\n* Initial Moisture Content: assumed 80%\n* Evaporation Model: more detailed\n\n### Final Answer\n-----------------\n\nAfter careful consideration and refinement, I propose the following answer:\n\n**Drying Time**: approximately **10-14 hours**\n\nThis range takes into account the factors of ambient temperature, humidity, air circulation, and initial moisture content. The actual drying time may vary depending on specific weather conditions and sock characteristics.\n\n---\n\nNote: This is a simplified example of how experts with logical thinking skills can collaboratively answer a question using a Tree of Thoughts method.

Here are some common categories:\n\n1. **Action Verbs** (also known as Dynamic Verbs): These verbs express physical or mental action.\n\t* Examples: run, jump, think, read\n2. **Linking Verbs**: These verbs connect the subject to additional information.\n\t* Examples: be, seem, appear, become\n3. **Auxiliary Verbs** (also known as Helping Verbs): These verbs are used to help form the tense, mood, or voice of another verb.\n\t* Examples: will, would, shall, can, may\n4. **Transitive Verbs**: These verbs take an object directly.\n\t* Examples: write, paint, buy, eat\n5. **Intransitive Verbs**: These verbs do not take an object directly.\n\t* Examples: sleep, laugh, cry, fall\n6. **Regular Verbs** (also known as Irregular Regular Verbs): These verbs follow a predictable pattern of conjugation.\n\t* Examples: walk, talk, read, write\n7. **Irregular Verbs**: These verbs do not follow a predictable pattern of conjugation.\n\t* Examples: go, take, be, make\n8. **Modal Verbs** (also known as Modal Auxiliaries): These verbs express modality or possibility.\n\t* Examples: can, could, may, might\n9. **Phrasal Verbs**: These verbs are composed of a verb and a preposition or adverb.\n\t* Examples: pick up, get on, turn off\n10. **Modalized Verbs** (also known as Modalized Phrases): These verbs are combined with modal auxiliaries to express modality.\n\t* Examples: must go, need to buy\n\nNote that these categories can sometimes overlap or be nuanced, and not all sources may categorize verbs in the same way.\n\nIt's worth mentioning that some linguists also distinguish between:\n\n* **Primary Verbs**: These are transitive verbs that take an object directly.\n* **Secondary Verbs**: These are auxiliary verbs used to form tenses, moods, or voices of primary verbs.\n\nHowever, these categories are less commonly taught and discussed in language classes.", "role": "assistant"}}], "created": 1728822352, "model": "llama-3.2-3b-instruct", "object": "chat.completion", "system_fingerprint": "llama-3.2-3b-instruct", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 468, "prompt_tokens": 32, "total_tokens": 500}, "time": "11.91"}

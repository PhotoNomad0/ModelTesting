In your case, it looks like the issue is with the file path of the private key.\n\nHere are a few possible reasons why you're getting this error:\n\n1. **Private key not readable**: Make sure that the private key file `UserKey.pem` is located in a directory that's accessible by the user running the SSH command. If the file is in a directory with permissions set to `read-only`, SSH won't be able to read it, resulting in this error.\n2. **Private key not executable**: Ensure that the private key file has execute permissions (i.e., `chmod +x ~/UserKey.pem`). This ensures that SSH can use the private key to authenticate.\n3. **File format issue**: Verify that the private key file is in the correct format for SSH. The most common formats are `.pem` and `.key`. If your private key file has a different extension or format, you may need to convert it.\n\nTo troubleshoot this issue, try the following:\n\n1. Check the permissions of the private key file using `ls -l ~/UserKey.pem`. Make sure that the user running the SSH command has read permission.\n2. Run the SSH command with the `-v` option to enable verbose mode, which will provide more detailed information about the authentication process. This may help you identify the specific issue:\n```bash\nssh -i \"~/UserKey.pem\" -v -C -L 25900:localhost:5900 ec2-34-221-131-108.us-west-2.compute.amazonaws.com\n```\n3. If you're using a Linux or macOS system, try moving the private key file to a directory like `~/.ssh/` (e.g., `mv ~/UserKey.pem ~/.ssh/`) and then run the SSH command again.\n\nIf none of these suggestions resolve the issue, please provide more details about your environment, including:\n\n* The operating system you're using\n* The version of SSH you have installed\n* Any additional configuration files or settings that might be relevant\n\nI'll be happy to help you further!", "role": "assistant"}}], "created": 1728822388, "model": "llama-3.2-3b-instruct", "object": "chat.completion", "system_fingerprint": "llama-3.2-3b-instruct", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 458, "prompt_tokens": 74, "total_tokens": 532}, "time": "11.72"}

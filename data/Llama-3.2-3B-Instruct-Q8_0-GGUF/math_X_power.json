Specifically, 8 is equal to 2^3. We can rewrite the first term using this fact:\n\n(2^3)^X + 2^X = 130\n\nUsing the power rule for exponents (a^(b+c) = a^b \u00d7 a^c), we can simplify further:\n\n2^(3X) + 2^X = 130\n\nNow, let's try to get rid of the two terms on the left-hand side by factoring out a common factor. Notice that both terms have a base of 2^X:\n\n2^X(2^(2X) + 1) = 130\n\nNotice that we can rewrite 2^(2X) as (2^X)^2, since (a^b)^c = a^(bc). However, this doesn't help much with factoring. So, let's try another approach.\n\nWe know that the sum of two numbers is equal to 130. To make things easier, we can look for some common factors or patterns in the equation. One approach is to think about possible values for X that would result in a factorable expression.\n\nAfter trying a few options, I noticed that if we let X = 3, then:\n\n2^X(2^(2X) + 1) = 2^3(2^6 + 1)\n= 8(64 + 1)\n= 8 \u00d7 65\n= 520 (not correct)\n\nHowever, if we try another value, X = 4:\n\n2^X(2^(2X) + 1) = 2^4(2^8 + 1)\n= 16(256 + 1)\n= 16 \u00d7 257\n\u2248 4110 (way too big)\n\nAnd if we reduce the exponent by 1, to X = 3:\n\n2^3(2^(2*3) + 1) = 8(64 + 1)\n= 8 \u00d7 65\n\u2248 520\n\nWait a minute... This is close! We can try reducing the first term by 4 (since we have an extra factor of 16 in our expression), or X = 2:\n\n2^X(2^(2X) + 1) = 2^2(2^4 + 1)\n= 4(16 + 1)\n= 4 \u00d7 17\n= 68\n\nStill too small. But we're getting closer!\n\nIf we let X = 3, and try to get rid of the factor of 8 in our equation:\n\n8(65) - 2^X + 2^X = 130\n\nWe find that if we use X = 2:\n\n8(65) = 520\n- 4 (to match the original left-hand side)\n+ 4 = 520 - 520 + 4\n= 4\n\nBut this is still not it! However, we notice that the previous calculations had an error. We can try again.\n\nSince (2^3)^X + 2^X = 130 and X must be a positive integer,\n\nLet us check for some small values of X:\n\n*   For X=1: \n8^1+2^1=10\n*   For X=2:\n8^2+2^2=68\n*   For X=3: \n8^3+2^3 = 512 + 8 = 520\n\nX is not equal to 1, 2 or 3.", "role": "assistant"}}], "created": 1728821957, "model": "llama-3.2-3b-instruct", "object": "chat.completion", "system_fingerprint": "llama-3.2-3b-instruct", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 787, "prompt_tokens": 42, "total_tokens": 829}, "time": "20.82"}

We can use the quadratic formula to solve for the remaining roots:\n\nx = (-b \u00b1 \u221a(b^2 - 4ac)) / 2a\nx = (-5 \u00b1 \u221a(5^2 - 4*1*26)) / (2*1)\nx = (-5 \u00b1 \u221a(25 - 104)) / 2\nx = (-5 \u00b1 \u221a(-79)) / 2\n\nSince the discriminant is negative, we get complex roots:\n\nx \u2248 (-5 \u00b1 i\u221a79) / 2\n\nSo, the solutions to the equation x^3 + x - 130 = 0 are:\n\n* Real root: x = 5\n* Complex roots: x \u2248 (-5 \u00b1 i\u221a79) / 2", "role": "assistant"}}], "created": 1728822040, "model": "llama-3.2-3b-instruct", "object": "chat.completion", "system_fingerprint": "llama-3.2-3b-instruct", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 483, "prompt_tokens": 41, "total_tokens": 524}, "time": "12.25"}

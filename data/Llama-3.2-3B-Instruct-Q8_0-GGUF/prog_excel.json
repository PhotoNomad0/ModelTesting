Here's how:\n\n1. Select the cell where you want to paste the contents.\n2. Type this expression: `=REPLACE(A1,\"'\"\",\"\")`\n\nAssuming:\n- `A1` is the cell that contains the text you want to copy from (replace `A1` with the actual reference of your source cell).\n- The ampersand (`&`) is used to concatenate the two arguments for the `REPLACE` function.\n\nThe expression works as follows:\n\n- `\"'\"\",\"\"`: This part tells LibreOffice Calc to replace all occurrences of single quotes (`'`) with nothing (essentially removing them).\n\nNote: This approach only removes single quotes from the text. If you need to remove other characters or perform more complex operations, you might need a different function or combination of functions.\n\nThis expression should be copied and pasted into your target cell to achieve the desired result.", "role": "assistant"}}], "created": 1728822418, "model": "llama-3.2-3b-instruct", "object": "chat.completion", "system_fingerprint": "llama-3.2-3b-instruct", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 223, "prompt_tokens": 43, "total_tokens": 266}, "time": "5.59"}

This ensures we only match files with the `.usfm` extension.\n* `\\.usfm$` matches the literal string \".usfm\" at the end of the string\n* `$` matches the end of the string\n\nHere's an example in Python using the `re` module:\n```python\nimport re\n\nfilename = \"57-1Jn.usfm\"\nmatch = re.match(r'^[0-9A-Za-z]{3}-\\.[^.]+\\.usfm$', filename)\nif match:\n    code = match.group(0)[4:]  # extract the three-character code after the hyphen\n    print(code)  # prints \"1Jn\"\nelse:\n    print(\"No match found\")\n```\nNote that if there are multiple matches (e.g., multiple files with \".usfm\" extensions in a directory), this regex will only find the first one. If you need to extract all matching codes, you'll need to use a different approach, such as iterating over all files in the directory and applying the regex to each filename.", "role": "assistant"}}], "created": 1728822460, "model": "llama-3.2-3b-instruct", "object": "chat.completion", "system_fingerprint": "llama-3.2-3b-instruct", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 335, "prompt_tokens": 78, "total_tokens": 413}, "time": "8.51"}

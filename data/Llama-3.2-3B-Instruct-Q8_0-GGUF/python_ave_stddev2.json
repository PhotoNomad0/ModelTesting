It raises an error if not.\n*   We calculate the average by summing up all the numbers in the list and dividing by the count of numbers.\n*   To calculate the standard deviation, we first find the variance by taking the average of the squared differences from the average for each number. Then, we take the square root of this variance to get the standard deviation.\n*   Finally, we return a tuple containing both values.\n\nNote that this function calculates the population standard deviation. If you want to calculate the sample standard deviation (which is more common when working with a subset of data), you should divide by `len(numbers) - 1` instead of `len(numbers)` in the calculation of variance and then square root it.", "role": "assistant"}}], "created": 1728822151, "model": "llama-3.2-3b-instruct", "object": "chat.completion", "system_fingerprint": "llama-3.2-3b-instruct", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 475, "prompt_tokens": 41, "total_tokens": 516}, "time": "12.40"}

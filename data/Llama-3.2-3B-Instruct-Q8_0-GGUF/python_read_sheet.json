The `read_spreadsheet` function takes a file path as an argument.\n2. It opens the file in read-only mode (`'r'`) and creates a `csv.DictReader` object, which reads the CSV file line by line and returns each row as a dictionary.\n3. The list comprehension `[row for row in csv_reader]` converts the reader object into a list of dictionaries, where each dictionary represents a row in the CSV file.\n4. If an error occurs while reading the file (e.g., file not found), it catches the exception and returns an empty list.\n\n**Assumptions:**\n\n* The CSV file has headers in the first row, which are used as keys for the dictionaries.\n* The data is properly formatted with commas separating values.\n\n**Note:** This example uses the `csv` module, which provides a simple way to read and write tabular data. If you're working with more complex spreadsheet formats (e.g., Excel), you may need to use additional libraries like `openpyxl` or `pandas`.", "role": "assistant"}}], "created": 1728822106, "model": "llama-3.2-3b-instruct", "object": "chat.completion", "system_fingerprint": "llama-3.2-3b-instruct", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 436, "prompt_tokens": 34, "total_tokens": 470}, "time": "11.30"}

It connects to the database, executes a SQL query to retrieve all records from the \"users\" table where the `age` field is greater than 32, and returns the result.\n\nNote that this code assumes you have a table named \"users\" with columns including an `age` field. Replace `\"example.db\"` with your actual database file name and adjust the table/column names as necessary to suit your specific use case.", "role": "assistant"}}], "created": 1728822423, "model": "llama-3.2-3b-instruct", "object": "chat.completion", "system_fingerprint": "llama-3.2-3b-instruct", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 348, "prompt_tokens": 42, "total_tokens": 390}, "time": "8.83"}

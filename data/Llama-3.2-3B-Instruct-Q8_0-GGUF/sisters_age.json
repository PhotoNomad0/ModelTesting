When you were 6 years old, your sister was half your age, which means she was:\n   6 / 2 = 3 years old.\n\n2. This means that the difference in their ages is always 3 years (6 - 3 = 3).\n\n3. Now, you are 80 years old. To find out how old your sister is now, we need to subtract the age difference from your current age:\n   80 - 3 = 77.\n\nTherefore, your sister is currently 77 years old.", "role": "assistant"}}], "created": 1728821898, "model": "llama-3.2-3b-instruct", "object": "chat.completion", "system_fingerprint": "llama-3.2-3b-instruct", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 121, "prompt_tokens": 57, "total_tokens": 178}, "time": "3.15"}

To find out how much time has passed since you were 6, we subtract: 80 - 6 = 74 years.\n\nSince your sister was 3 when you were 6, we need to add those 74 years to her age at that time. So, we multiply the number of years by her age at that time: 74 x 3 = 222.\n\nNow, we add this result back to her original age: 222 + 3 = 225.\n\nTherefore, your sister is now **225 years old**.", "role": "assistant"}}], "created": 1728821901, "model": "llama-3.2-3b-instruct", "object": "chat.completion", "system_fingerprint": "llama-3.2-3b-instruct", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 166, "prompt_tokens": 51, "total_tokens": 217}, "time": "4.41"}

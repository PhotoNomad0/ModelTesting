Write a response that appropriately completes the request.\n\n### Instruction:\nTom washed 10 pairs of socks. The socks are now wet from the wash, so Tom hangs the 10 pairs of socks outside to dry. 10 hours later, he comes back outside to check on the socks. He feels each sock and notices they are all dry. He takes them back inside because they are all dry. How long will it take Tom to dry seven pairs of socks presuming the same weather conditions?\n\n### Response:\n\nIf 10 hours were enough for 10 pairs of socks, then with the same weather conditions, 7 pairs of socks would need (10 / 7) = 1.43 more hours to dry. So, it will take Tom about 10 + 1.43 = 11.43 hours to dry seven pairs of socks."}], "created": 1692966087, "id": "foobarbaz", "model": "ggml-Manticore-13B-Chat-Pyg-Guanaco-GGML-q4_K_M.bin", "object": "text_completion", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 81, "prompt_tokens": 148, "total_tokens": 229}, "time": "18.90"}

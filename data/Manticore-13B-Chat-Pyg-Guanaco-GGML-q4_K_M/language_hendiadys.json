The name \"hendiadys\" comes from the Greek word for \"one through ten,\" as it was originally used to describe a list of items that could be divided into groups of ten.\n\nFor example, \"shopping cart\" is a hendiady: it combines \"shopping\" and \"cart\" to mean one thing - a device used for carrying shopping items while browsing in a store. Another example would be \"raincoat,\" which combines \"rain\" and \"coat\" to mean a garment designed to keep you dry in the rain.\n\nHendiadys can also be used for effect, to create a more vivid or poetic description of something. It can also be used to simplify language by combining two ideas into one concise phrase."}], "created": 1689468509, "id": "foobarbaz", "model": "ggml-Manticore-13B-Chat-Pyg-Guanaco-GGML-q4_K_M.bin", "object": "text_completion", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 203, "prompt_tokens": 21, "total_tokens": 224}, "time": "20.57"}

Write a response that appropriately completes the request.\n\n### Instruction:\nwhat is a Hendiadys?\n\n### Response:\n\nA Hendiadys is a figure of speech where two words are used to express one idea, instead of the usual word order in which the first word functions as an adjective for the second. The term \"Hendiadys\" comes from the Greek words for \"one and then another,\" referring to the close association between the two words used together.\n\nAn example of a Hendiadys is \"rain hard,\" where \"hard\" is used as an adverb to describe the noun \"rain.\" In this case, the two words work together to convey the intensity or force of the rain. Another example would be \"a fisherman's net,\" where \"fisherman's\" is used as an attributive noun to modify \"net.\"\n\nHendiadys can add complexity and depth to language by creating new associations between words and ideas, and can also be a useful tool for concise and effective communication."}], "created": 1692966688, "id": "foobarbaz", "model": "ggml-Manticore-13B-Chat-Pyg-Guanaco-GGML-q4_K_M.bin", "object": "text_completion", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 193, "prompt_tokens": 57, "total_tokens": 250}, "time": "26.85"}

Here are some of the most common types of verbs:\n1. Dynamic Verbs: These verbs describe actions that happen or are happening. They end in -ing or irregular forms. Examples include run, walk, talk, etc.\n2. Stative Verbs: These verbs describe states or conditions rather than actions. They do not usually take an object and often cannot be used with the -ing form. Examples include be, have, seem, etc.\n3. Transitive Verbs: These verbs require a direct object to receive the action. The object can be a noun or pronoun. Examples include give, sell, tell, etc.\n4. Intransitive Verbs: These verbs do not take a direct object and the subject of the sentence is doing something without an object. Examples include sleep, sit, stand, etc.\n5. Imperative Verbs: These verbs are used to issue commands or requests. They end in -e for singular subjects and -en for plural subjects. Examples include \"Run!\" \"Walk faster!\" etc.\n6. Auxiliary Verbs: These verbs help to form tenses, aspects, and moods of main verbs. They include verbs such as have, will, can, etc.\n7. Modal Verbs: These verbs express possibility, obligation, or necessity. They do not always correspond to a physical action but rather convey attitudes or states of mind. Examples include may, might, must, etc.\n8. Light Verbs: These verbs are used in informal speech and writing and do not necessarily have a strong meaning behind them. Examples include \"be,\" \"have,\" \"do.\""}], "created": 1689468547, "id": "foobarbaz", "model": "ggml-Manticore-13B-Chat-Pyg-Guanaco-GGML-q4_K_M.bin", "object": "text_completion", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 386, "prompt_tokens": 21, "total_tokens": 407}, "time": "38.08"}

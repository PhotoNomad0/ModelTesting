Action Verbs - These verbs describe actions or things that happen, such as run, jump, sing, etc.\n2. Linking Verbs - These verbs connect the subject and predicate but do not express an action, instead they show a state of being, such as feel, look, sound, etc.\n3. Helping Verbs - These verbs help the main verb in a sentence to form the correct tense, such as am, is, are, was, were, etc.\n4. Intransitive Verbs - These verbs do not take an object and describe an action that does not affect anything else, such as sleep, dream, sit, etc.\n5. Transitive Verbs - These verbs take an object and describe an action that affects something else, such as give, take, break, etc.\n6. Stative Verbs - These verbs describe a state or condition rather than an action, such as be, have, seem, etc."}], "created": 1692966718, "id": "foobarbaz", "model": "ggml-Manticore-13B-Chat-Pyg-Guanaco-GGML-q4_K_M.bin", "object": "text_completion", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 225, "prompt_tokens": 57, "total_tokens": 282}, "time": "29.87"}

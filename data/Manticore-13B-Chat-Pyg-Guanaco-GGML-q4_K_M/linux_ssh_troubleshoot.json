Write a response that appropriately completes the request.\n\n### Instruction:\nwhy does this command give error Permission denied (publickey):\n\nssh -i \"~/UserKey.pem\" -C -L 25900:localhost:5900 ec2-34-221-131-108.us-west-2.compute.amazonaws.com\n\n### Response:\n\nThe error \"Permission denied (publickey)\" when using SSH to connect to an EC2 instance via a private key indicates that the public key of the user trying to connect is not authorized on the EC2 instance. This means that either the public key has not been added to the authorized_keys file on the EC2 instance or there is a permission issue with the file system where the authorized_keys file is located.\n\nIn the case of your command, it looks like you are using a private key file named \"UserKey.pem\" and trying to connect to the EC2 instance via an SSH tunnel. The \"-C\" option in the command is used to disconnect from the local terminal after the tunnel has been established, which may not be necessary for your use case.\n\nTo troubleshoot this error, you can try the following steps:\n1. Check that the \"UserKey.pem\" file contains the private key for the user who wants to connect to the EC2 instance.\n2. Ensure that the public key is added to the authorized_keys file on the EC2 instance. You can do this by using the \"ssh-add\" command to add the public key to your local system, and then use the \"cat\" command to copy the public key from your local system to the authorized_keys file on the EC2 instance via SSH.\n3. Check that the permissions of the authorized_keys file are set properly and that the user who owns the file has read and execute permission.\n4. Try using a different terminal or SSH client, as some clients may have different settings or configurations that could be causing the error.\n5. If you are using an Amazon EC2 instance, check the security group rules for the instance to ensure that port 25900 is allowed inbound from your local machine.\n\nIf none of these steps work, please provide more information about your EC2 instance and the exact command you are using so I can assist you further."}], "created": 1692966829, "id": "foobarbaz", "model": "ggml-Manticore-13B-Chat-Pyg-Guanaco-GGML-q4_K_M.bin", "object": "text_completion", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 420, "prompt_tokens": 122, "total_tokens": 542}, "time": "50.17"}

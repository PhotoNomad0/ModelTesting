Prepare the equation by isolating X on one side:\n\n8^X + 2^X = 130\n\n2. Take the logarithm of both sides to the base 8:\n\nXlog2(8) + Xlog2(2) = 5\n\n3. Simplify the right-hand side by adding the logs:\n\nXlog2(8) + Xlog2(2) - 5 = 0\n\n4. Use the fact that log2(16) = log2(2^8) = 8 to simplify the left-hand side:\n\nXlog2(8) - 5 = Xlog2(2) - 5\n\n5. Solve for X by isolating it on one side:\n\nXlog2(2) - 5 = Xlog2(2) - 5\n\nTherefore, X = 0.\n\nSo the solution to the equation 8^X + 2^X = 130 is X = 0."}], "created": 1689466925, "id": "foobarbaz", "model": "ggml-Manticore-13B-Chat-Pyg-Guanaco-GGML-q4_K_M.bin", "object": "text_completion", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 248, "prompt_tokens": 32, "total_tokens": 280}, "time": "32.00"}

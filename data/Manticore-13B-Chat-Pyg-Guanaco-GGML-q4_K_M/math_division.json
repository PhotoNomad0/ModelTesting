Write a response that appropriately completes the request.\n\n### Instruction:\nIn the morning, Emily decided to create some designs with her cereal bits. In total, she created 9 designs and used 63 cereal bits. About how many cereal bits were in each design? Do you think she used an equal number of cereal bits in each design?\n\n### Response:\n\nTo find out about how many cereal bits Emily used for each design, we can divide the total number of cereal bits (63) by the number of designs she created (9):\n\n63 \u00f7 9 = 7 cereal bits per design.\n\nSo, Emily used an average of 7 cereal bits per design. It's not possible to tell if she used an equal number of cereal bits in each design without more information about the designs themselves."}], "created": 1692965260, "id": "foobarbaz", "model": "ggml-Manticore-13B-Chat-Pyg-Guanaco-GGML-q4_K_M.bin", "object": "text_completion", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 108, "prompt_tokens": 114, "total_tokens": 222}, "time": "20.97"}

In total, she created 9 designs and used 63 cereal bits. About how many cereal bits were in each design? Do you think she used an equal number of cereal bits in each design?\nIf Emily created 9 designs using 63 cereal bits, then each design must have had an average of 7 cereal bits. So it's possible that she used an unequal amount of cereal bits in each design. It's also possible that she may have changed the number of cereal bits per design as she progressed through her creations. Without more information, we can only make these generalizations based on the given data."}], "created": 1689466805, "id": "foobarbaz", "model": "ggml-Manticore-13B-Chat-Pyg-Guanaco-GGML-q4_K_M.bin", "object": "text_completion", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 98, "prompt_tokens": 78, "total_tokens": 176}, "time": "18.61"}

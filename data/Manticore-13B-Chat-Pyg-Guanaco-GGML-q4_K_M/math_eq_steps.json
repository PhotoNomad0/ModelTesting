First, let's isolate the 4 by subtracting 2 from both sides:\n25 - 2(4) + 3 = ?\n2. Next, we can add 8 to both sides to get rid of the 2 and the 4:\n25 - 2(4) + 3 = 25 - 8 + 3\n25 - 4 + 3 = 16 + 3\n16 = ?\n3. Finally, we can subtract 3 from both sides to get the final answer:\n16 - 3 = 13\nThe solution to the equation is 13."}], "created": 1689466963, "id": "foobarbaz", "model": "ggml-Manticore-13B-Chat-Pyg-Guanaco-GGML-q4_K_M.bin", "object": "text_completion", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 155, "prompt_tokens": 31, "total_tokens": 186}, "time": "22.29"}

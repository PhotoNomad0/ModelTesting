So by being one more than a square number, this number must be 31 (which is 5 plus 1).\n\nTherefore, the number in question is 31."}], "created": 1689466985, "id": "foobarbaz", "model": "ggml-Manticore-13B-Chat-Pyg-Guanaco-GGML-q4_K_M.bin", "object": "text_completion", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 137, "prompt_tokens": 48, "total_tokens": 185}, "time": "21.48"}

Write a response that appropriately completes the request.\n\n### Instruction:\nin ax^3+bx^2+c*x+d=0, use the cardano's formula to get the value for x where a=1, b=0, c=1 and d=-130\n\n### Response:\n\nTo solve this equation using Cardano's Formula, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. Set up the equation in standard form:\na*x^3 + b*x^2 + c*x = d\n2. Determine the coefficients of x and x^2:\na = 1, b = 0, c = 1\n3. Solve for the coefficient of x by substituting the value of a in the expression for c:\nc = (1/3)*b\n4. Set up a system of two equations in two unknowns to solve for x and y:\nx = -b/3 + y\ny = 2/3\n5. Substitute the value of y in the first equation to get an expression for x alone:\nx = (-1/3) + (2/3) = 1/3\n6. Therefore, the solution to the equation ax^3 + bx^2 + c*x + d = -130 is x = 1/3."}], "created": 1692965599, "id": "foobarbaz", "model": "ggml-Manticore-13B-Chat-Pyg-Guanaco-GGML-q4_K_M.bin", "object": "text_completion", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 226, "prompt_tokens": 98, "total_tokens": 324}, "time": "30.72"}

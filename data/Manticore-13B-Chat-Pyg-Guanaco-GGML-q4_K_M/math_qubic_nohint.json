Write a response that appropriately completes the request.\n\n### Instruction:\nin x^3+x-130=0, solve for the value for x\n\n### Response:\n\nThe expression can be rearranged to the standard form of a cubic equation by subtracting 130 and then dividing both sides by x:\n\nx^3 + x - 130 = 0\nx(x^2 + 1) - 130 = 0\n\nNow, let w = x^2 + 1. Then, we have:\n\nw - 1 = x^2\nw = x^2 + 1\n\nSubstituting this expression for w into the original equation, we get:\n\n(x^2 + 1) - 130 = 0\nx^2 + 1 - 130 = 0\n\nTo solve for x, we can set each side of the equation equal to zero and solve for x:\n\nx^2 + 1 = 130\nx^2 = 140\nx = 12 or x = -12 (since x is a real number)\n\nTherefore, in the expression x^3+x-130=0, the value of x is either 12 or -12."}], "created": 1692965684, "id": "foobarbaz", "model": "ggml-Manticore-13B-Chat-Pyg-Guanaco-GGML-q4_K_M.bin", "object": "text_completion", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 253, "prompt_tokens": 68, "total_tokens": 321}, "time": "32.65"}

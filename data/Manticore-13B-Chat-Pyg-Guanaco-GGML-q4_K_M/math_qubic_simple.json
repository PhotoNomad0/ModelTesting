Here are the steps to use Cardano's formula to find the value of x in your equation:\n1. Use long division to check if the equation has any rational roots (roots that can be expressed as fractions). If it does, those will be the first two solutions for x.\n2. If there are no rational roots, then Cardano's formula can be used to find the remaining solution(s). The formula is:\na + b = 1/3 (where a and b are the two rational roots found in step 1)\nc = -405/9\nd = 2870/9\ne = 64/9\nf = -105/9\ng = 1/3\nh = 1/3\ni = 1/3\nj = 1/3\nk = 1/3\nl = 1/3\nm = 1/3\nn = 1/3\np = -270/9\nq = 45/9\nr = -18/9\ns = 6/9\nt = -1/3\nu = 1/3\nv = 1/3\nw = 1/3\nx = (a + b)c + d\ny = ac^2 + bd + e\nz = c^3 + d(e - k) + f\n3. Substitute the values of a, b, c, d, e, f, g, h, i, j, k, l, m, n, p, q, r, s, t, u, v, w, x, y, and z into Cardano's formula to get expressions for x, y, and z.\n4. Solve the expressions for x, y, and z using algebra or calculus (or both) as needed.\n5. Check the solutions obtained from Cardano's formula by substituting them back into the original equation and making sure they all work out.\n6. If there are any discrepancies or inconsistencies, recheck your work and try to identify where the error may have occurred.\n7. The final solution for x in the equation x^3+x-130=0 should be one of the values obtained from Cardano's formula (or a combination of rational roots and Cardano's formula)."}], "created": 1689467127, "id": "foobarbaz", "model": "ggml-Manticore-13B-Chat-Pyg-Guanaco-GGML-q4_K_M.bin", "object": "text_completion", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 540, "prompt_tokens": 39, "total_tokens": 579}, "time": "60.10"}

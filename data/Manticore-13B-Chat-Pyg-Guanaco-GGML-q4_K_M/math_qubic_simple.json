Write a response that appropriately completes the request.\n\n### Instruction:\nin x^3+x-130=0, use the cardano's formula to get the value for x\n\n### Response:\n\nCardano's formula can be used to solve the third-degree equation x^3 + x - 130 = 0. Here are the steps to follow:\n\n1. To use Cardano's formula, you need to first rewrite the equation in standard form by completing the square:\nx^2 + (1/2)x + (1/4) - 130 = x^2 + (1/2)x + b\n2. Now, you can use Cardano's formula to solve for b:\nb = (1/2) x (x + 10) - (1/8)\n3. Substitute the value of b back into the original equation in standard form and simplify:\nx^2 + (1/2)x + (1/4) - 130 = x^2 + (1/2)x + b\n= x^2 + (1/2)x - (1/8)\n= (7/8)x^2 + (5/8)x - 16\n4. To find the value of x, you can use the quadratic formula:\nx = (-b \u00b1 sqrt(b^2 - 4ac)) / 2a\nwhere a = 7/8, b = -(1/2), and c = 5/8.\n\nx = (-(1/2) \u00b1 sqrt((1/2)^2 - (7/8)(-16))) / 2(7/8)\nx = (10 \\/ 4) \u00b1 sqrt(100 \\- 35)\nx = (2.5 \\+ 0.89) \u00b1 5.1\nx = 3.39 or x = -0.61\n\nTherefore, using Cardano's formula and the quadratic formula, the two solutions to the third-degree equation x^3 + x - 130 = 0 are x = 3.39 and x = -0.61."}], "created": 1692965651, "id": "foobarbaz", "model": "ggml-Manticore-13B-Chat-Pyg-Guanaco-GGML-q4_K_M.bin", "object": "text_completion", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 454, "prompt_tokens": 75, "total_tokens": 529}, "time": "51.96"}

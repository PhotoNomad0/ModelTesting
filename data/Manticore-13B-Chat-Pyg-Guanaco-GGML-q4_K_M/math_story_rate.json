After he broke his arm, he had to use his left hand for a while, and he could only type 6 words per minute. What is the difference between the number of words he could type in 5 minutes before and after he broke his arm\nThe difference between the number of words Cam could type in 5 minutes before and after he broke his arm is 9 min / 5 min = 1.8 words per minute. So, before the break, he was able to type 360 words (9 wpm x 5 mins) but after the break, he could only type 240 words (6 wpm x 5 mins). The difference is 120 words or 120 / 5 = 24 words per minute.\n\nTherefore, the answer is 24."}], "created": 1689466787, "id": "foobarbaz", "model": "ggml-Manticore-13B-Chat-Pyg-Guanaco-GGML-q4_K_M.bin", "object": "text_completion", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 124, "prompt_tokens": 86, "total_tokens": 210}, "time": "21.73"}

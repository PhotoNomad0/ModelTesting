Write a response that appropriately completes the request.\n\n### Instruction:\nIn Science class, Sara needed 8 test tubes for 3 different experiments. The first experiment required 2 test tubes and the other two experiments required the same number of test tubes. How many test tubes were needed for each of the other two experiments?\n\n### Response:\n\nFor the second experiment, Sara needed to use a total of 3 - 2 = 1 more test tube than she used for the first experiment. So, she needed an additional 1 * 2 = 2 test tubes for this experiment.\n\nSimilarly, for the third experiment, Sara needed to use a total of 3 - 1 = 2 more test tubes than she used for the second experiment. So, she needed an additional 2 * 2 = 4 test tubes for this experiment.\n\nTherefore, in all, Sara needed 2 + 2 + 4 = 8 test tubes to conduct all three experiments."}], "created": 1692965083, "id": "foobarbaz", "model": "ggml-Manticore-13B-Chat-Pyg-Guanaco-GGML-q4_K_M.bin", "object": "text_completion", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 145, "prompt_tokens": 105, "total_tokens": 250}, "time": "23.57"}

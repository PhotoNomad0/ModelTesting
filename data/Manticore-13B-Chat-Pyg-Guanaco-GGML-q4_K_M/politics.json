What may be considered less bad by one person may not be the same for another. \n\nRepublicans, Democrats, and Libertarians all have different platforms and policies, and each of them has its own strengths and weaknesses in terms of addressing various issues such as economy, healthcare, social justice, environment, etc. \n\nWhat's more important is to look at the individual candidates running for office, their track record, their stance on key issues, and their commitment to representing the interests of all people, not just a select few. It's also crucial to be informed about the issues, stay engaged in the political process, and vote for the candidate who aligns with your values and priorities."}], "created": 1689467004, "id": "foobarbaz", "model": "ggml-Manticore-13B-Chat-Pyg-Guanaco-GGML-q4_K_M.bin", "object": "text_completion", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 181, "prompt_tokens": 30, "total_tokens": 211}, "time": "19.04"}

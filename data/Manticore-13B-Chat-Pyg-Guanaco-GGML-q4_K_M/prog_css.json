Write a response that appropriately completes the request.\n\n### Instruction:\nHow do you align a row of divs to the right using flex in css?  Show me an example.\n\n### Response:\n\nTo align a row of Divs to the right using Flexbox in CSS, you can use the `flex-direction` property set to `row`, and the `justify-content` property set to `flex-end`. Here's an example code snippet that demonstrates this:\n```css\n.flex-container {\n  display: flex;\n  flex-direction: row;\n  width: match-parent;\n}\n\n.flex-item {\n  flex: 1;\n  padding: 10px;\n  background-color: #eee;\n  text-align: center;\n}\n\n/* Add some margins to the items */\n.flex-item:nth-child(even) {\n  margin-bottom: 20px;\n}\n\n.right-aligned {\n  flex-direction: column;\n  justify-content: flex-end;\n}\n```\nIn this example, we have a parent container with the class `flex-container` that is set to display as a row of flex items using the `flex-direction` property. Each child item has the class `flex-item` and is given a flex factor of 1, which means they will occupy equal space in the row.\n\nThe second part of the code demonstrates how to align an additional set of div's to the right using Flexbox. We have added another container with the class `right-aligned` that has its `flex-direction` property set to column, which flips the flex direction from row to column. We have also used the `justify-content` property set to `flex-end`, which aligns the content to the far right of the container.\n\nHere's an example of how you might use this code:\n```html\n<div class=\"flex-container\">\n  <div class=\"flex-item\">Item 1</div>\n  <div class=\"flex-item\">Item 2</div>\n  <div class=\"flex-item\">Item 3</div>\n  <div class=\"right-aligned\">\n    <div class=\"flex-item\">Right-aligned item 1</div>\n    <div class=\"flex-item\">Right-aligned item 2</div>\n  </div>\n  <div class=\"flex-item\">Item 4</div>\n  <div class=\"flex-item\">Item 5</div>\n  <div class=\"flex-item\">Item 6</div>\n</div>\n```\nIn this example, the first six div's with the class `flex-item` will be aligned in a row to the left using Flexbox. The last two div's with the class `right-aligned` will be aligned to the right of the container and also use Flexbox to size and position them relative to each other."}], "created": 1692966898, "id": "foobarbaz", "model": "ggml-Manticore-13B-Chat-Pyg-Guanaco-GGML-q4_K_M.bin", "object": "text_completion", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 625, "prompt_tokens": 71, "total_tokens": 696}, "time": "69.59"}

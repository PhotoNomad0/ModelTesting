Otherwise, it sorts the list using the `sorted` function and takes the second element (the largest number) minus the first element (the smallest number) to get the largest difference."}], "created": 1689467250, "id": "foobarbaz", "model": "ggml-Manticore-13B-Chat-Pyg-Guanaco-GGML-q4_K_M.bin", "object": "text_completion", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 162, "prompt_tokens": 55, "total_tokens": 217}, "time": "24.06"}

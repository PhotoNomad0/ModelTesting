Write a response that appropriately completes the request.\n\n### Instruction:\nPython program\nDefine a function named largest_difference that takes a list of numbers as its only parameter.\nYour function should compute and return the difference between the largest and smallest number in the list.\n\n### Response:\n\nSure, here's a Python function definition for the \"largest_difference\" function that takes a list of numbers as its argument and returns the difference between the largest and smallest numbers in the list:\n\n```python\ndef largest_difference(numbers):\n    if not numbers:\n        return 0\n    \n    sorted_numbers = sorted(numbers)\n    return sorted_numbers[1] - sorted_numbers[0]\n```\n\nThis function first checks if the input list is empty, in which case it returns 0 (as there can be no difference between two zeroes). Otherwise, it sorts the list using the `sorted` function and takes the second element (`sorted_numbers[1]`) as the largest number and the first element (`sorted_numbers[0]`) as the smallest number. The difference between these two numbers is then returned by the function."}], "created": 1692965825, "id": "foobarbaz", "model": "ggml-Manticore-13B-Chat-Pyg-Guanaco-GGML-q4_K_M.bin", "object": "text_completion", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 188, "prompt_tokens": 91, "total_tokens": 279}, "time": "27.16"}

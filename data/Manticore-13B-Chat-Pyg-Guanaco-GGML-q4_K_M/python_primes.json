Here's a Python program that uses a loop to check if each number from 2 up to 100 is a prime number or not, and then prints out the first 100 prime numbers:\n\n```python\nimport math\n\ndef is_prime(n):\n    if n < 2:\n        return False\n    for i in range(2, int(math.sqrt(n)) + 1):\n        if (n % i) == 0:\n            return False\n    return True\n\nprimes = []\ni = 2\nwhile len(primes) < 100:\n    if is_prime(i):\n        primes.append(i)\n    i += 1\n\nprint(\"The first 100 prime numbers are:\")\nfor p in primes:\n    print(p, end=\" \")\n```\n\nThis program uses the `is_prime` function to check if a number is prime or not. It starts with 2 and goes up to the square root of the given number plus 1, and for each number it checks if it's divisible by any other number from 2 to the end of the loop (including itself). If it's not divisible by anything else, then it's a prime number.\n\nThe program then uses a while loop to keep adding numbers that are prime until it has found 100 of them. It appends each prime number to an empty list called `primes`, and then prints out the first 100 prime numbers using a for-loop."}], "created": 1689467285, "id": "foobarbaz", "model": "ggml-Manticore-13B-Chat-Pyg-Guanaco-GGML-q4_K_M.bin", "object": "text_completion", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 348, "prompt_tokens": 28, "total_tokens": 376}, "time": "34.76"}

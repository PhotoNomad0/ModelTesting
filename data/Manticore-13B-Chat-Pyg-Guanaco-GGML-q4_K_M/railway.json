Write a response that appropriately completes the request.\n\n### Instruction:\nExplain origin of standard gauge for railways\n\n### Response:\n\nThe standard gauge of 4 feet, 8.5 inches (1,435 millimeters) for railway tracks was not a random choice but the result of a historical process that dates back to the early days of rail transportation in Britain.\n\nIn the 19th century, when steam locomotives were first introduced, there was no standardized gauge for railway tracks in Europe or America. Different companies and countries used their own gauges, which ranged from as narrow as 2 feet (610 millimeters) to as wide as 7 feet (2,135 millimeters).\n\nThis lack of uniformity made it difficult for trains to run on different tracks, especially when they crossed borders. It also created inefficiencies in terms of maintenance and repair of locomotives and cars, which had to be customized for each gauge.\n\nThe standardization of the 4 feet, 8.5 inches (1,435 millimeters) gauge was the result of a decision made by the Great Western Railway (GWR) in Britain. The GWR was founded by Isambard Kingdom Brunel and was one of the first railway companies to use steam locomotives on a large scale.\n\nBrunel believed that a standard gauge would be more economical and practical than the narrow gauges used by many other railways at the time. He argued that a wider gauge would allow for faster and smoother rides, as well as greater capacity for freight and passenger traffic.\n\nThe GWR's success with its standard gauge system inspired others to follow suit, and over time, the 4 feet, 8.5 inches (1,435 millimeters) gauge became the predominant standard in Britain and many other parts of the world.\n\nToday, the standard gauge is used for most railway tracks in the world, including those in Europe, North America, and much of Asia. It has become a symbol of the efficiency and interconnectedness of modern transportation systems, thanks to the efforts of early rail pioneers like Isambard Kingdom Brunel who championed the benefits of standardization."}], "created": 1692965346, "id": "foobarbaz", "model": "ggml-Manticore-13B-Chat-Pyg-Guanaco-GGML-q4_K_M.bin", "object": "text_completion", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 456, "prompt_tokens": 58, "total_tokens": 514}, "time": "55.65"}

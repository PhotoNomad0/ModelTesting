Write a response that appropriately completes the request.\n\n### Instruction:\nwhen I was 6, my sister was half my age. Now I am 80. How old is my sister now?\n\n### Response:\n\nWhen you were 6 years old, your sister was (6 - 3) = 3 years old. This means that she was half of your age at the time, which is a common way to determine someone's age in relation to another person's age.\n\nFast forward to now, when you are 80 years old. Your sister would be (80 - 3) = 77 years old. This is because she has aged at the same rate as you since you were both 6 years old.\n\nTherefore, your sister is currently 77 years old."}], "created": 1692965059, "id": "foobarbaz", "model": "ggml-Manticore-13B-Chat-Pyg-Guanaco-GGML-q4_K_M.bin", "object": "text_completion", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 127, "prompt_tokens": 76, "total_tokens": 203}, "time": "21.05"}

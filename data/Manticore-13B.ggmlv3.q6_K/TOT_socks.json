The socks are now wet from the wash, so Tom hangs the 10 pairs of socks outside to dry. 10 hours later, he comes back outside to check on the socks. He feels each sock and notices they are all dry. He takes them back inside because they are all dry. How long will it take Tom to dry seven pairs of socks presuming the same weather conditions?\"\n### Assistant:\n\nThree experts with exceptional logical thinking skills are collaboratively answering a question using a Tree of Thoughts method.

Organize the entire response in a markdown format.\nExpert 1:\nTom washed 10 pairs of socks. He hung them outside to dry for 10 hours. After 10 hours, he checked on the socks and they were all dry. So, it took Tom 10 + 10 = 20 hours to dry 10 pairs of socks.\nExpert 2:\nIf we assume that each pair of socks takes an equal amount of time to dry, then it would take 20 / 10 = 2 hours for each pair of socks to dry. So, if Tom wants to dry seven pairs of socks, it will take him 7 * 2 = 14 hours.\nExpert 3:\nTo dry the remaining 7 pairs of socks, we can assume that they would also take 2 hours each to dry. Therefore, it would take 14 + 14 = 28 hours for Tom to dry all seven pairs of socks."}], "created": 1688213042, "id": "foobarbaz", "model": "", "object": "text_completion", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 306, "prompt_tokens": 222, "total_tokens": 528}, "time": "55.41"}

Then,\nYZ = 130\nMultiplying both sides by 8^X, we get:\nY^2Z = (8^X)^(YZ)\nSimplifying the right side, we have:\n8^(2X) = (8^X)^Y\nDividing both sides by 8^X, we get:\n8^(2X - X) = Y\nTaking logarithms of both sides to base 8, we obtain:\n(2X - X) = log_8 Y\nSubtracting X from both sides, we have:\n2X - X = log_8 Y - X\nSimplifying the right side, we get:\n2X = log_8 Y + X\nDividing both sides by 2, we obtain:\nX = (log_8 Y + X)/2\nSubstituting X = 0 into this equation, we have:\n(log_8 Y + X)/2 = 0\nSolving for X, we get:\nX = - log_8 Y/2\nNow we need to check if this value of X satisfies the original equation. We can do this by substituting X = - log_8 Y/2 into the original equation and simplifying:\n8^(-log_8 Y/2) + 2^(log_8 Y/2) = 130\nSimplifying, we get:\n(8^Y)^(-1/2) + 2^(Y/2) = 130\nThis equation is satisfied for all values of Y. Therefore, the solution for X is - log_8 Y/2."}], "created": 1688212749, "id": "foobarbaz", "model": "", "object": "text_completion", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 427, "prompt_tokens": 44, "total_tokens": 471}, "time": "50.44"}

In total, she created 9 designs and used 63 cereal bits. About how many cereal bits were in each design? Do you think she used an equal number of cereal bits in each design?\n### Assistant:\n\nTo solve this problem, we need to divide the total number of cereal bits by the number of designs.\nThe total number of cereal bits is 63 + 9(x) = 63 + 9x.\nWe don't know how many cereal bits were in each design, so we can't solve for x yet. However, we do know that the sum of all the cereal bits used in all the designs is 63 + 9x.\nTherefore, we can set up an equation:\n63 + 9x = 63 + 9y\nSimplifying this equation, we get:\n9x = 9y\nDividing both sides by 9, we get:\nx = y\nSo each design used the same number of cereal bits."}], "created": 1688212629, "id": "foobarbaz", "model": "", "object": "text_completion", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 181, "prompt_tokens": 90, "total_tokens": 271}, "time": "44.71"}

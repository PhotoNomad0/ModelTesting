She would fold five letter size pieces of paper three times then cut along the lines. She would then stack the smaller note papers and staple them together. How long would one notepad last if someone wrote ten notes per day?\n### Assistant:\n\nThe notepads are made up of five letter size pieces of paper folded three times, so there are 5 * 3 = 15 sheets in each pad. If someone writes ten notes per day, they will use one sheet every two days (10 / 2). So the notepad would last for 15 / 2 = 7.5 days."}], "created": 1688212569, "id": "foobarbaz", "model": "", "object": "text_completion", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 80, "prompt_tokens": 90, "total_tokens": 170}, "time": "17.51"}

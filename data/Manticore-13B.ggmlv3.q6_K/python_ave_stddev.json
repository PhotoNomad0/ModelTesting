Here's an example code snippet that demonstrates how to do this:\n```python\nimport statistics\nnumbers = [10, 25, 36, 49] # replace with your own list of numbers\naverage = statistics.mean(numbers)\nstandard_deviation = statistics.stdev(numbers)\nprint(\"Average:\", average)\nprint(\"Standard deviation:\", standard_deviation)\n```\nThis code imports the `statistics` module, creates a list of numbers called `numbers`, calculates their mean using the `mean()` function and stores it in the variable `average`. It also calculates their standard deviation using the `stdev()` function and stores it in the variable `standard_deviation`. Finally, it prints out both values."}], "created": 1689469197, "id": "foobarbaz", "model": "ggml-Manticore-13B.ggmlv3.q6_K.bin", "object": "text_completion", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 193, "prompt_tokens": 26, "total_tokens": 219}, "time": "22.89"}

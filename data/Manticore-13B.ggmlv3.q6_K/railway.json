This was chosen as a compromise between two competing gauges that were popular in the early days of railway development.\n\nOne of these gauges was the broad gauge, which had a width of 2,140 millimeters (7 feet). It was used primarily by the Great Western Railway in England and its associated companies. The other gauge was the narrow gauge, which varied but was typically around 914 millimeters (3 feet) wide. Narrow-gauge railways were more common in mountainous or sparsely populated areas where it was difficult to build standard-gauge lines.\n\nThe decision to adopt a standard gauge for the British railway network was made by Parliament in 1846, following a report from a committee chaired by Sir Charles Pasley. The committee recommended that a uniform gauge of 5 feet (1,524 millimeters) be adopted, which would allow interchangeable parts and equipment to be used on all lines.\n\nHowever, the committee also recognized that this was not practical in terms of existing railway infrastructure, so they suggested that a compromise gauge of 4 feet 8.5 inches (1,435 millimeters) be adopted instead. This would allow for some standardization while still allowing for compatibility with existing lines and equipment.\n\nThe decision to adopt this standard gauge was not without controversy, as many people felt that it favored the Great Western Railway at the expense of other companies. However, in the end, the benefits of standardization outweighed these concerns, and the standard gauge became the dominant one used throughout much of the world."}], "created": 1688212698, "id": "foobarbaz", "model": "", "object": "text_completion", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 375, "prompt_tokens": 34, "total_tokens": 409}, "time": "43.85"}

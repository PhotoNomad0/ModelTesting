How old is my sister now?\nYour sister would be 40 years old because when you were both 6 and she was half your age (3), that means she was 1/2 * 6 = 3 years old. So, if you are currently 80 years old, then it has been 77 years since you were both 6 years old. Now add the number of years between when you were both 6 and now to your sister's current age: 80 + 77 = 157. Since there is no year zero in our counting system, we need to subtract one from that total (since it would be 2019 - 1 instead of just 2019): 157 - 1 = 156 years old."}], "created": 1689468650, "id": "foobarbaz", "model": "ggml-Manticore-13B.ggmlv3.q6_K.bin", "object": "text_completion", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 163, "prompt_tokens": 40, "total_tokens": 203}, "time": "68.16"}

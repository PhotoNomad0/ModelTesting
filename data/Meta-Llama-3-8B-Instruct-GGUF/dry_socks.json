To find the time it takes to dry 7 pairs (14 socks), we can set up a proportion:\n\nTime taken for 20 socks = Time taken for 14 socks \u00d7 (Number of socks / Total number of socks)\n\nLet x be the time taken for 7 pairs (14 socks) to dry.\n\nTime taken for 20 socks = 10 hours\nTotal number of socks = 20 + 14 = 34\n\nNow, substitute these values into the proportion:\n\n10 = x \u00d7 (14 / 34)\n10 = x \u00d7 (2/3.5)\nx = 15 hours\n\nSo, it will take Tom approximately 15 hours to dry seven pairs of socks under the same weather conditions.", "role": "assistant"}}], "created": 1727009427, "model": "lmstudio-community/Meta-Llama-3-8B-Instruct-GGUF/Meta-Llama-3-8B-Instruct-Q4_K_M.gguf", "object": "chat.completion", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 174, "prompt_tokens": 132, "total_tokens": 306}, "time": "14.15"}

There are several categories of figures of speech, which can be broadly classified into three main groups:\n\n1. **Rhetorical Figures**:\n\t* Alliteration (repetition of initial consonant sounds)\n\t* Assonance (repetition of vowel sounds)\n\t* Consonance (repetition of similar consonant sounds)\n\t* Enjambment (the running on of a sentence or phrase from one line to the next without a pause)\n\t* Epistrophe (repetition of words or phrases at the end of sentences or clauses)\n\t* Hyperbaton (the inversion of normal word order for emphasis or effect)\n\t* Hypophora (a rhetorical question asked in order to answer it oneself)\n\t* Irony (the use of words to convey a meaning that is opposite of their literal sense)\n\t* Metaphor (the comparison of two unlike things without using \"like\" or \"as\")\n\t* Onomatopoeia (words that imitate the sounds they describe)\n\t* Oxymoron (the combination of two contradictory terms)\n\t* Personification (attribution of human qualities to non-human entities)\n\t* Pun (a play on words, often using double meaning or multiple meanings)\n\t* Simile (the comparison of two unlike things using \"like\" or \"as\")\n2. **Tropes**:\n\t* Allegory (a story, poem, or picture that can be interpreted to reveal a hidden meaning)\n\t* Antithesis (the juxtaposition of two contrasting ideas or phrases)\n\t* Apostrophe (addressing a person or thing that is not present)\n\t* Binarism (the use of binary oppositions, such as light and dark, to create meaning)\n\t* Euphemism (the use of indirect or evasive language to avoid offense or unpleasantness)\n\t* Hyperbole (exaggeration used for emphasis or effect)\n\t* Litotes (the use of understatement for irony or effect)\n\t* Meiosis (the use of understatement or humility to convey modesty or self-deprecation)\n\t* Metonymy (the substitution of one word or phrase for another with which it is closely associated)\n\t* Synecdoche (the use of a part of something to represent the whole, or vice versa)\n3. **Idiomatic Expressions**:\n\t* Clich\u00e9s (overused expressions that have lost their original impact)\n\t* Colloquialisms (informal language used in everyday conversation)\n\t* Idioms (fixed expressions with figurative meanings)\n\t* Proverbs (short sayings that express a general truth or piece of advice)\n\nThese categories are not exhaustive, and some figures of speech may overlap between categories.

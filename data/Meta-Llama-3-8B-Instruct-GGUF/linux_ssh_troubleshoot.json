Try changing the permission of the key file using `chmod`:\n```bash\nchmod 600 ~/UserKey.pem\n```\nThis sets the permissions to \"read-only\" for the owner and group, while denying all access to others.\n3. **Key file format**: Make sure that your key file is in the correct format (PEM or SSH2). You can use `ssh-keygen -p` to check the format:\n```bash\nssh-keygen -p ~/UserKey.pem\n```\nIf it's not in the expected format, you might need to convert it using tools like OpenSSL.\n4. **Identity file not found**: Ensure that the key file is named correctly and that there are no typos or extra spaces in the filename.\n5. **SSH configuration issues**: Check your SSH configuration files (`~/.ssh/config` or `/etc/ssh/sshd_config`) for any errors or inconsistencies.\n\nTo troubleshoot further, you can try:\n\n* Running `ssh -vvv -i \" ~/UserKey.pem\" ec2-34-221-131-108.us-west-2.compute.amazonaws.com` to get more verbose output.\n* Checking the SSH logs on your local machine and the remote server for any errors or warnings related to key authentication.\n\nIf none of these suggestions help, please provide more details about your environment, the exact error message, and any relevant configuration files.

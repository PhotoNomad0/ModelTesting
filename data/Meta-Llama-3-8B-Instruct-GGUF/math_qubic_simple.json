Let's dive into it.\n\nGiven equation: x^3 + x - 130 = 0\n\nTo apply Cardano's Formula, we need to convert the cubic equation to a depressed cubic equation (a cubic equation with no quadratic term):\n\nx^3 + ax + b = 0\n\nIn this case, a = 1 and b = -130.\n\nNow, let's define:\n\nq = -b/3 = 130/3\nr = (3a/b)^(1/2) = (3/(-130))^(1/2) = (-1)/(10\u221a13)\n\nThe value of p is calculated as the sum of q and its conjugate:\n\np = q + \u221a(q^3 - r^3)\n= 130/3 + \u221a((130/3)^3 - (-1/(10\u221a13))^3)\n= 43.333... + \u221a(-12125/2197 + (1/(100*13)))\n= 43.333... + \u221a(-55/2197)\n\nNow, let's calculate the two complex roots:\n\nr1 = p + \u221a(p^2 - q^3)\n= 43.333... + \u221a((-55/2197) + (130/3)^3 + 2\u221a(q^3 - r^3))\n= 43.333... + \u221a((12125/2197) + (130/3)^3)\n\nr2 = p - \u221a(p^2 - q^3)\n= 43.333... - \u221a((-55/2197) + (130/3)^3 + 2\u221a(q^3 - r^3))\n= 43.333... - \u221a((12125/2197) + (130/3)^3)\n\nThe two complex roots are:\n\nx = r1 = 43.333... + \u221a((12125/2197) + (130/3)^3)\nx = r2 = 43.333... - \u221a((12125/2197) + (130/3)^3)\n\nNow, let's find the real root using the sum of the roots formula:\n\nx1 + x2 + x3 = -b/a\n= -(-130)/1\n= 130\n\nSince we know one of the complex roots (let's say r1), we can calculate the other two roots as:\n\nx2 = r1 - p\nx3 = r2 - p\n\nNow, you should be able to find all three roots: x1, x2, and x3.\n\nPlease note that these calculations might be lengthy and involve complex numbers.

In reality, users might re-use some notes or write on only one side, extending the life of the notepad.\n\nTo be more conservative, let's estimate the notepad would last around 5-6 days with moderate use.", "role": "assistant"}}], "created": 1727008835, "model": "lmstudio-community/Meta-Llama-3-8B-Instruct-GGUF/Meta-Llama-3-8B-Instruct-Q4_K_M.gguf", "object": "chat.completion", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 375, "prompt_tokens": 105, "total_tokens": 480}, "time": "27.11"}

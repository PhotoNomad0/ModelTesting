The `INDIRECT` function allows you to dynamically reference a cell by its name, rather than hardcoding it in the formula.\n\nNote: Make sure to adjust the cell reference (\"A1\" in this example) to match the actual location of the cell containing the text you want to modify.", "role": "assistant"}}], "created": 1727009999, "model": "lmstudio-community/Meta-Llama-3-8B-Instruct-GGUF/Meta-Llama-3-8B-Instruct-Q4_K_M.gguf", "object": "chat.completion", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 198, "prompt_tokens": 64, "total_tokens": 262}, "time": "14.05"}

This anchors the match to start after the hyphen.\n* `(?=.*\\.usfm$)`: This is a positive lookahead assertion that ensures the match is followed by \".usfm\" at the end of the string. This anchors the match to end with \".usfm\".\n* `[a-zA-Z0-9]{3}`: This matches exactly 3 characters that are either uppercase letters (`[A-Z]`), lowercase letters (`[a-z]`) or digits (`[0-9]`). The `^` at the start and `$` at the end of the character class ensure that all 3 characters must match this pattern.\n\nHere's an example in Python:\n\n```\nimport re\n\nfilename = \"57-1Jn.usfm\"\nmatch = re.search(r'(?<=-)(?=.*\\.usfm$)[a-zA-Z0-9]{3}', filename)\nif match:\n    print(match.group())  # Output: '1Jn'\nelse:\n    print(\"No match found\")\n```\n\nThis will extract the three character code \"1Jn\" from the filename.", "role": "assistant"}}], "created": 1727010103, "model": "lmstudio-community/Meta-Llama-3-8B-Instruct-GGUF/Meta-Llama-3-8B-Instruct-Q4_K_M.gguf", "object": "chat.completion", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 297, "prompt_tokens": 103, "total_tokens": 400}, "time": "22.94"}

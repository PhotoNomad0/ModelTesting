In earlier versions of Python, you can use the following formula:\n```\nimport math\n\nstd_dev = math.sqrt(sum((x - average) ** 2 for x in numbers) / (len(numbers) - 1))\n```\nAlternatively, you can also use the `numpy` library to calculate the standard deviation:\n```\nimport numpy as np\n\nnumbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9]\n\naverage = np.mean(numbers)\nstd_dev = np.std(numbers)\n\nprint(\"Average:\", average)\nprint(\"Standard Deviation:\", std_dev)\n```", "role": "assistant"}}], "created": 1727009379, "model": "lmstudio-community/Meta-Llama-3-8B-Instruct-GGUF/Meta-Llama-3-8B-Instruct-Q4_K_M.gguf", "object": "chat.completion", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 285, "prompt_tokens": 59, "total_tokens": 344}, "time": "20.60"}

We import the `statistics` module, which provides functions for calculating various statistical measures.\n2. The function takes a list of numbers as input, which is stored in the variable `numbers`.\n3. We use the `mean()` function from the `statistics` module to calculate the average of the list of numbers.\n4. We use the `stdev()` function from the `statistics` module to calculate the standard deviation of the list of numbers.\n5. The function returns a tuple containing both the average and standard deviation.\n\nYou can test this function with a sample list of numbers, like this:\n```\nnumbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]\navg, std_dev = calculate_stats(numbers)\nprint(f\"Average: {avg:.2f}, Standard Deviation: {std_dev:.2f}\")\n```\nThis would output something like:\n```\nAverage: 3.00, Standard Deviation: 1.41\n```\nNote that the `statistics` module uses the sample standard deviation by default, which is suitable for most cases. If you want to use the population standard deviation instead, you can set the `norm` parameter to `True`, like this:\n```\nstd_dev = statistics.stdev(numbers, norm=True)\n```", "role": "assistant"}}], "created": 1727009400, "model": "lmstudio-community/Meta-Llama-3-8B-Instruct-GGUF/Meta-Llama-3-8B-Instruct-Q4_K_M.gguf", "object": "chat.completion", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 368, "prompt_tokens": 62, "total_tokens": 430}, "time": "26.50"}

It then enters a loop where it increments the current number `i` and checks if it's prime using the `is_prime(i)` function. If it is, it adds it to the list of prime numbers. The loop continues until there are 100 prime numbers in the list.\n\nPlease note that this program is not very efficient for large numbers because it checks divisibility up to the square root of `n`. For larger ranges of prime numbers, you may want to use a more advanced algorithm or a library like `sympy` which has built-in support for primality testing.", "role": "assistant"}}], "created": 1727009231, "model": "lmstudio-community/Meta-Llama-3-8B-Instruct-GGUF/Meta-Llama-3-8B-Instruct-Q4_K_M.gguf", "object": "chat.completion", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 258, "prompt_tokens": 59, "total_tokens": 317}, "time": "18.39"}

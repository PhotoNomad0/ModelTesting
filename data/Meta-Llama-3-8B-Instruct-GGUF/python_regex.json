We use the `splitext` function from the `os.path` module to split the filename into its base name and extension.\n2. We check if the extension is \".usfm\" and return None if it's not.\n3. We use a regex pattern `\\b(\\w{3})\\b` to match three characters (either letters or digits) surrounded by word boundaries (`\\b`). The parentheses around `\\w{3}` create a capture group, which allows us to retrieve the matched text using `match.group(1)`.\n4. If a match is found, we return the captured text converted to lowercase using the `lower()` method.\n5. We catch any exceptions that may occur during execution and print an error message if one occurs.\n\nNote that this function assumes that the three character code is always preceded by some other characters in the filename (e.g. \"57-\"). If you need to extract a three character code from a filename with a different format, you'll need to modify the regex pattern accordingly.", "role": "assistant"}}], "created": 1727010193, "model": "lmstudio-community/Meta-Llama-3-8B-Instruct-GGUF/Meta-Llama-3-8B-Instruct-Q4_K_M.gguf", "object": "chat.completion", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 376, "prompt_tokens": 116, "total_tokens": 492}, "time": "28.30"}

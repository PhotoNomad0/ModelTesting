This is important to note because it helps us clarify how we're counting.\n\nThe sentence then says her brothers have 2 sisters. Since Sally doesn't have any brothers of her own, this means that these 2 sisters belong to her brothers. In other words, these 2 sisters are the daughters of Sally's parents, just like her brothers are.\n\nNow, here's where it might seem a little tricky: we're asked how many sisters Sally has. But remember, Sally doesn't have any brothers herself; she only has brothers through her family relationship (her brothers). So, when we count the 2 sisters who belong to her brothers, those sisters don't actually belong to Sally.\n\nIn conclusion, Sally has no sisters of her own. The 2 sisters mentioned in the question are daughters of her parents, just like her brothers are, but they're not siblings of Sally's.", "role": "assistant"}}], "created": 1727009057, "model": "lmstudio-community/Meta-Llama-3-8B-Instruct-GGUF/Meta-Llama-3-8B-Instruct-Q4_K_M.gguf", "object": "chat.completion", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 216, "prompt_tokens": 73, "total_tokens": 289}, "time": "14.77"}

You are currently 80 years old. To find out how old your sister is now, we need to add the number of years that have passed since you were 6:\n\n80 (your current age) - 6 (your age when your sister was 3) = 74\n\nSo, 74 years have passed.\n\nTo find your sister's current age, we add the number of years she was initially 3 to the additional years that have passed:\n\n3 (her initial age) + 74 (additional years) = 77\n\nTherefore, your sister is currently 77 years old.", "role": "assistant"}}], "created": 1727008798, "model": "lmstudio-community/Meta-Llama-3-8B-Instruct-GGUF/Meta-Llama-3-8B-Instruct-Q4_K_M.gguf", "object": "chat.completion", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 190, "prompt_tokens": 78, "total_tokens": 268}, "time": "15.62"}

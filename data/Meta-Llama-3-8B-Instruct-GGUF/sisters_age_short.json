To find your sister's current age, we need to add the number of years that have passed since you were both 6 and 3 years old, respectively.\n\nThat's a difference of 80 - 6 = 74 years.\n\nSo, if your sister was 3 years old when you were 6, she is now 3 + 74 = 77 years old.", "role": "assistant"}}], "created": 1727008814, "model": "lmstudio-community/Meta-Llama-3-8B-Instruct-GGUF/Meta-Llama-3-8B-Instruct-Q4_K_M.gguf", "object": "chat.completion", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 131, "prompt_tokens": 72, "total_tokens": 203}, "time": "10.04"}

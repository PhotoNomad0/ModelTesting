These sisters are not all different from Sally. In fact, they are Sally herself and her unknown siblings (which we'll call \"Sally's unknown sisters\").\n\nSo, to answer the question: Sally has 1 sister (herself) and some unknown number of additional sisters. We don't know how many more sisters Sally has beyond just herself.\n\nIn summary, the statement is a bit misleading, as it implies that Sally's brothers have 2 distinct sisters, but in reality, they are referring to Sally and her unknown siblings.", "role": "assistant"}}], "created": 1727009037, "model": "lmstudio-community/Meta-Llama-3-8B-Instruct-GGUF/Meta-Llama-3-8B-Instruct-Q4_K_M.gguf", "object": "chat.completion", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 178, "prompt_tokens": 70, "total_tokens": 248}, "time": "13.27"}

Figures of speech are a way to use language in a non-literal sense. Here are some common categories:\n\n1. **Metaphor**: Comparing two things without using \"like\" or \"as.\"\nExample: \"He is a lion on the soccer field.\"\n2. **Simile**: Comparing two things using \"like\" or \"as.\"\nExample: \"He runs like a cheetah.\"\n3. **Alliteration**: Repeating initial consonant sounds in words.\nExample: \"She sells seashells by the seashore.\"\n4. **Personification**: Attributing human qualities to non-human entities.\nExample: \"The sun smiled down on us.\"\n5. **Hyperbole**: Exaggerating for emphasis or effect.\nExample: \"I'm so hungry I could eat a whole elephant!\"\n6. **Idiom**: A fixed expression with a specific meaning.\nExample: \"It's raining cats and dogs.\"\n7. **Onomatopoeia**: Words that imitate sounds.\nExample: \"The firework exploded with a loud 'Boom!'\"\n8. **Symbolism**: Using objects, colors, or other elements to represent abstract ideas.\nExample: The American flag symbolizes freedom.\n\nThese categories are not exhaustive, and figures of speech can be classified in various ways depending on the context.

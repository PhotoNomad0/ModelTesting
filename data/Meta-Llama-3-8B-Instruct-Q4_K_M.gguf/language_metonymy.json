I'd be happy to help you with that!\n\nA metonymy is a figure of speech in which a word or phrase is replaced by another word or phrase closely associated with it. This can include replacing a part of something for the whole, or vice versa. For example:\n\n* \"The White House announced a new policy\" (where \"White House\" refers to the administration or government)\n* \"I got a new set of wheels\" (where \"wheels\" refers to a car)\n\nMetonymy is often used in everyday language and can be found in literature, poetry, and even advertising. It's a clever way to convey meaning without using literal language!\n\nWould you like me to explain more or help with something else?"}, "finish_reason": "stop"}], "usage": {"prompt_tokens": 94, "completion_tokens": 154, "total_tokens": 248}, "time": "12.44"}

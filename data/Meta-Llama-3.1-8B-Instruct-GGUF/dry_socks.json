We can write:\n\n10 hours / 10 pairs = x hours / 7 pairs\n\nTo solve for x, we can cross-multiply and simplify:\n\nx = (10 hours \u00d7 7 pairs) / 10 pairs\nx = 70/10\nx = 7 hours\n\nTherefore, it will take Tom approximately 7 hours to dry 7 pairs of socks under the same weather conditions.", "role": "assistant"}}], "created": 1727034949, "model": "lmstudio-community/Meta-Llama-3.1-8B-Instruct-GGUF/Meta-Llama-3.1-8B-Instruct-Q4_K_M.gguf", "object": "chat.completion", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 142, "prompt_tokens": 129, "total_tokens": 271}, "time": "9.35"}

Here are some of the main categories:\n\n**Literary Devices**\n\n1. **Metaphor**: A comparison between two unlike things without using \"like\" or \"as.\"\n2. **Simile**: A comparison between two unlike things using \"like\" or \"as.\"\n3. **Personification**: Attributing human qualities to non-human entities.\n4. **Alliteration**: Repetition of initial consonant sounds in words.\n5. **Assonance**: Repetition of vowel sounds in words.\n\n**Rhetorical Devices**\n\n1. **Idiom**: A phrase or expression with a non-literal meaning.\n2. **Hyperbole**: An exaggeration used for emphasis.\n3. **Irony**: Saying the opposite of what you mean, often to be sarcastic or humorous.\n4. **Oxymoron**: A combination of two words with contradictory meanings.\n5. **Onomatopoeia**: Words that imitate the sounds they describe.\n\n**Other categories**\n\n1. **Tropes**: Figures of speech used for figurative language, such as simile, metaphor, and personification.\n2. **Figures of thought**: Devices that express a particular way of thinking or feeling, like allusion, analogy, and allegory.\n3. **Figures of sound**: Devices that play with the sound of words, such as assonance, consonance, and onomatopoeia.\n\nThese categories are not exhaustive, but they cover many of the common figures of speech used in language.

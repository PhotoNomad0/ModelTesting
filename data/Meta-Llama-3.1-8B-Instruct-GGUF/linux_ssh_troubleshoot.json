In your command, you're using `~` to represent your home directory, but this might not work as expected with SSH.\n2. **File permissions**: Ensure that the file permissions of `~/UserKey.pem` allow it to be read by the user running the SSH client (typically yourself). Run `chmod 400 ~/UserKey.pem` to set the file to read-only for the owner.\n3. **Private key format**: Make sure your private key is in a compatible format. If your key is encrypted, you might need to add a passphrase when generating it or providing it with the `-o PrivateKeyPassphrase` option.\n4. **Identity file location**: The `ssh-agent` service might not be able to find the identity file specified by the `-i` option if it's not in one of the standard locations (e.g., `~/.ssh/id_rsa`).\n5. **Permissions on your user home directory or .ssh subdirectory**: Ensure that these directories are accessible.\n\nTo resolve this issue, you can try:\n\n* Specifying an absolute path instead of a relative one: Replace `~/UserKey.pem` with `/home/your_username/UserKey.pem`.\n* Running the command with elevated privileges (although it's generally not recommended to run SSH commands as root): `sudo ssh -i \"~/UserKey.pem\" ...`\n* Using the `-v` flag for verbose output to see more detailed information about what's going wrong.\n\nIf none of these suggestions help, please provide more details about your setup and environment, and I'll do my best to assist you further.", "role": "assistant"}}], "created": 1727035455, "model": "lmstudio-community/Meta-Llama-3.1-8B-Instruct-GGUF/Meta-Llama-3.1-8B-Instruct-Q4_K_M.gguf", "object": "chat.completion", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 385, "prompt_tokens": 92, "total_tokens": 477}, "time": "18.84"}

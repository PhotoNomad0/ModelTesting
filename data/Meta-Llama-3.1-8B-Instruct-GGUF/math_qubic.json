In your case, we can simplify the equation first:\n\nx^3 + 0*x^2 + x - 130 = 0\nx^3 + x - 130 = 0\n\nNow, let's use Cardano's Formula for the reduced cubic equation: x^3 + px + q = 0.\n\nHere, p = 1 and q = -130. We need to find a value of y such that:\n\ny^2 + 4py = -9q/p\ny^2 + 4(1)y = -9(-130)/1\n\nSimplifying further:\ny^2 + 4y = 1170\n\nRearrange the equation to form a quadratic equation in y:\ny^2 + 4y + 1170 = 0\n\nNow, we'll use the quadratic formula (which is actually what Cardano's Formula uses behind the scenes):\n\ny = (-b \u00b1 \u221a(b\u00b2 - 4ac)) / 2a\nHere, a = 1, b = 4, and c = 1170.\n\nPlug in these values:\ny = (-4 \u00b1 \u221a((4)\u00b2 - 4*1*1170)) / (2*1)\ny = (-4 \u00b1 \u221a(16 - 4680)) / 2\ny = (-4 \u00b1 \u221a(-4664)) / 2\n\nNow, we have a complex number. Simplify the expression inside the square root:\n-4664 \u2248 (68 \u00d7 69) - i\u00b2\nSince i\u00b2 = -1, we can write this as:\n\u221a(-4664) \u2248 \u221a(i^2 * (68^2 - 1))\n\nSimplify further using complex numbers rules:\n-\u221a4664 \u2248 \u00b1\u221a((69 + i)(69 - i))\n= \u00b1\u221a((69)^2 - i^2)\n\u2248 \u00b1\u221a(4725)\n\ny = (-4 \u00b1 (\u221a4725)i) / 2\n\nNow we need to find x. Plug in the value of y back into the original equation:\nx = (y\u00b3 + 3py\u00b2 + 3pq - 3py - q)^(1/3)\nWe already know that p = 1 and q = -130.\n\nFirst, let's expand y^3 and simplify it:\ny^3 = ((-4 \u00b1 (\u221a4725)i) / 2)^3\n= (-4/2)\u00b3 + (3 \u00d7 (-4/2)^2 \u00d7 (\u221a4725)i) / 2 + (3 \u00d7 -130 \u00d7 ((-4 \u00b1 (\u221a4725)i)/2)) / 2\n\nAfter the necessary algebra, we can simplify the expression and find x.\n\nPlease note that Cardano's formula might result in complex solutions. In this case, we'll have three roots for our original cubic equation: x_1, x_2 and x_3.\n\nOne of these roots will be real while the other two are complex conjugates.\n\nLet me calculate it out for you...\n\nAfter some calculations, I got:\n\nx_1 \u2248 5.0 + 10.7i\nx_2 = -130/((5+10.7i)^2) \u2248 3.9 \nx_3 = Conjugate of x_2\n\nHowever, in the original equation, we have an integer constant and a real root is expected.\n\nLet's try another approach that simplifies our calculations using a substitution: \n\nLet z = x - (1/3). Then z^3 + 3z + q = 0 where q = -130 - c.", "role": "assistant"}}], "created": 1727034668, "model": "lmstudio-community/Meta-Llama-3.1-8B-Instruct-GGUF/Meta-Llama-3.1-8B-Instruct-Q4_K_M.gguf", "object": "chat.completion", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 766, "prompt_tokens": 85, "total_tokens": 851}, "time": "36.83"}

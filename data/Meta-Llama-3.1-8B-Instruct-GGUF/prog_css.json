Here's an example:\n\n```css\n.container {\n  display: flex;\n}\n\n.divs {\n  width: 100px;\n  height: 50px;\n  margin-right: 20px;\n  background-color: #f0f0f0; /* for demonstration purposes only */\n}\n\n/* This is the key property to align the divs to the right */\n.container {\n  justify-content: flex-end;\n}\n```\n\n```html\n<div class=\"container\">\n  <div class=\"divs\"></div>\n  <div class=\"divs\"></div>\n  <div class=\"divs\"></div>\n</div>\n```\n\nIn this example, the container has a `display` value of `flex`, which enables Flexbox. The `.divs` elements are children of the container and have been assigned widths and heights for demonstration purposes.\n\nThe magic happens in the CSS rule that targets the container. By setting `justify-content` to `flex-end`, we're telling the browser to align the divs to the end (right) of their parent container, while still allowing them to maintain their relative positions within the flow of the layout.\n\nNote: If you want to justify content only for a specific row or column, you might need to adjust your HTML structure and target that specific element with your Flexbox properties.", "role": "assistant"}}], "created": 1727035474, "model": "lmstudio-community/Meta-Llama-3.1-8B-Instruct-GGUF/Meta-Llama-3.1-8B-Instruct-Q4_K_M.gguf", "object": "chat.completion", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 299, "prompt_tokens": 66, "total_tokens": 365}, "time": "74.48"}

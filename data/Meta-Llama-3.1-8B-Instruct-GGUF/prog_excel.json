However, a more direct approach is to use the `SUBSTITUTE` function with multiple instances of the character you want to replace.\n\nHere's how you can achieve it:\n\nAssuming the cell you want to copy from is A1 and the cell where you want to paste is B1 (after removing all single quotes), you would use the following formula in B1:\n\n```excel\n=SUBSTITUTE(A1,\"'\",\"\")\n```\n\nHowever, if you need to replace multiple instances of the same character or handle more complex scenarios, you might also consider using `REPLACE` like so:\n\n```excel\n=REPLACE(A1,FIND(\"'\",&A1)+1,LEN(A1)-FIND(\"'\",&A1+1),\"\")\n```\n\nThis formula works by finding the position of the first single quote in the cell's value (`&A1`) and then replacing everything after that character with an empty string. It essentially deletes all characters from the first single quote to the end of the string.\n\nBut for removing a single quote without changing the structure or other content of the cell, `SUBSTITUTE` is generally more straightforward and efficient:\n\n```excel\n=SUBSTITUTE(A1,\"'\",\"\")\n```\n\nThis formula simply replaces every occurrence of a single quote with an empty string, effectively deleting it.", "role": "assistant"}}], "created": 1727036499, "model": "lmstudio-community/Meta-Llama-3.1-8B-Instruct-GGUF/Meta-Llama-3.1-8B-Instruct-Q4_K_M.gguf", "object": "chat.completion", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 298, "prompt_tokens": 61, "total_tokens": 359}, "time": "13.89"}

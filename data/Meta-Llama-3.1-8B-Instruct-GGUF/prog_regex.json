If you want to match that format specifically, I'd need a bit more info on the desired pattern of the filename.\n\nHere's how you can use it in Python:\n\n```python\nimport re\n\nfilename = \"57-1Jn.usfm\"\nmatch = re.search(r\"\\b\\w{3}\\.usfm$\", filename)\nif match:\n    print(match.group())\nelse:\n    print(\"No match found\")\n```\n\nIf you want to extract the 3 character code from a string that contains `57-1Jn.usfm`, like \"This file is 57-1Jn.usfm\", you can do:\n\n```python\nfilename = \"This file is 57-1Jn.usfm\"\nmatch = re.search(r\"\\b\\w{3}\\.usfm$\", filename)\nif match:\n    # If it's a full filename, group(0) will contain the whole match,\n    # but if you want to extract just the code, use group(0)[4:7]\n    print(filename[filename.index(match.group()):])\nelse:\n    print(\"No match found\")\n```", "role": "assistant"}}], "created": 1727037151, "model": "lmstudio-community/Meta-Llama-3.1-8B-Instruct-GGUF/Meta-Llama-3.1-8B-Instruct-Q4_K_M.gguf", "object": "chat.completion", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 465, "prompt_tokens": 96, "total_tokens": 561}, "time": "22.78"}

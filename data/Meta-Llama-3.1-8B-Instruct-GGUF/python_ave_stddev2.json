It includes input validation to ensure that the input is a list of numeric values.\n\n**Note:** This implementation uses NumPy for efficient computation, but you can also use built-in Python functions if you don't have NumPy installed. The alternative would be:\n\n```python\ndef calculate_stats(numbers):\n    avg = sum(numbers) / len(numbers)\n    variance = sum((x - avg) ** 2 for x in numbers) / (len(numbers) - 1) if len(numbers) > 1 else 0\n    std_dev = variance ** 0.5\n    return avg, std_dev\n```\n\nHowever, the NumPy version is generally faster and more efficient for large datasets.", "role": "assistant"}}], "created": 1727034928, "model": "lmstudio-community/Meta-Llama-3.1-8B-Instruct-GGUF/Meta-Llama-3.1-8B-Instruct-Q4_K_M.gguf", "object": "chat.completion", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 433, "prompt_tokens": 59, "total_tokens": 492}, "time": "21.44"}

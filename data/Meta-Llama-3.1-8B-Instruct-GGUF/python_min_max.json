If you want to handle this case, we can modify the function as follows:\n```python\ndef largest_difference(numbers):\n    \"\"\"\n    Compute the difference between the largest and smallest number in the list.\n\n    Parameters:\n    numbers (list): A list of numbers.\n\n    Returns:\n    int or float: The difference between the largest and smallest number.\n    \"\"\"\n    if not numbers:\n        return None  # or raise a custom exception\n    return max(numbers) - min(numbers)\n```\nAlternatively, we can also add some error checking to ensure that the input list contains only numbers:\n```python\ndef largest_difference(numbers):\n    \"\"\"\n    Compute the difference between the largest and smallest number in the list.\n\n    Parameters:\n    numbers (list): A list of numbers.\n\n    Returns:\n    int or float: The difference between the largest and smallest number.\n    \"\"\"\n    if not all(isinstance(x, (int, float)) for x in numbers):\n        raise ValueError(\"Input list must contain only numbers\")\n    return max(numbers) - min(numbers)\n```", "role": "assistant"}}], "created": 1727034793, "model": "lmstudio-community/Meta-Llama-3.1-8B-Instruct-GGUF/Meta-Llama-3.1-8B-Instruct-Q4_K_M.gguf", "object": "chat.completion", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 416, "prompt_tokens": 81, "total_tokens": 497}, "time": "19.46"}

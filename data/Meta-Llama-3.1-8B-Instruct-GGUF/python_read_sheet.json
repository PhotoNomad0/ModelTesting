It uses the `pd.read_excel()` function to read the data into a pandas DataFrame, which is then returned by the function.\n\nYou can customize this function to suit your needs. For example, you could add error handling for different types of spreadsheet files, or modify the function to read specific columns or rows from the spreadsheet.\n\nNote: You'll need to install the `pandas` library if it's not already installed in your Python environment. You can do this using pip:\n```bash\npip install pandas\n```\nAlso, make sure that the spreadsheet file is in a format that can be read by pandas (e.g., `.xls`, `.xlsx`, etc.).", "role": "assistant"}}], "created": 1727034858, "model": "lmstudio-community/Meta-Llama-3.1-8B-Instruct-GGUF/Meta-Llama-3.1-8B-Instruct-Q4_K_M.gguf", "object": "chat.completion", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 380, "prompt_tokens": 52, "total_tokens": 432}, "time": "18.38"}

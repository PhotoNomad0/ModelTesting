The `for loop` iterates through each row in the `rows` list, printing its contents to the console.\n\n**Note**: You'll need to replace `my_table` with your actual table name, and adjust the query as needed for your specific database schema.\n\nMake sure you have SQLite installed on your system (it usually comes pre-installed) and that you've created a table named `my_table` in the specified database file. If not, you can create the table using SQL commands like this:\n```python\nquery = \"\"\"\n    CREATE TABLE my_table (\n        name TEXT,\n        age INTEGER,\n        other_column TEXT\n    );\n\"\"\"\ncursor.execute(query)\n```", "role": "assistant"}}], "created": 1727036513, "model": "lmstudio-community/Meta-Llama-3.1-8B-Instruct-GGUF/Meta-Llama-3.1-8B-Instruct-Q4_K_M.gguf", "object": "chat.completion", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 482, "prompt_tokens": 60, "total_tokens": 542}, "time": "61.17"}

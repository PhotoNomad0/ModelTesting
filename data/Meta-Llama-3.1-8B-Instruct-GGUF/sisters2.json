Sally has 3 brothers, and their parents also have other children (her brothers).\n2. Those other children are her brothers' sisters.\n3. Each of Sally's brothers has 2 sisters (according to the given information).\n\nSince each brother has 2 sisters, the total number of sisters among Sally's brothers is:\n3 (brothers) \u00d7 2 (sisters per brother) = 6\n\nThese 6 girls are not Sally herself, but her brothers' sisters.

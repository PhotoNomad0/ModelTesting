Sally has 3 brothers.\n2. Each of her brothers has 2 sisters (not including Sally herself).\n3. Since each brother has the same number of sisters, and there are 3 brothers, we can multiply the number of sisters per brother by the number of brothers: 2 sisters/ brother \u00d7 3 brothers = 6 sisters.\n\nHowever, these 6 sisters include Sally's sisters. To find out how many sisters Sally has, we need to subtract her own sisters from the total count. Since Sally is one of them, there are only 5 other sisters who are not Sally herself.\n\nTherefore, Sally has **5** sisters.", "role": "assistant"}}], "created": 1727034661, "model": "lmstudio-community/Meta-Llama-3.1-8B-Instruct-GGUF/Meta-Llama-3.1-8B-Instruct-Q4_K_M.gguf", "object": "chat.completion", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 146, "prompt_tokens": 70, "total_tokens": 216}, "time": "6.70"}

When you were 6 years old, your sister was half your age:\n\t* Your age at that time: 6\n\t* Sister's age at that time: 6 / 2 = 3 (since she was half your age)\n2. Now, we know your current age is 80. Let's use this information to find the difference in years between now and when you were 6:\n\t* Difference in years: 80 - 6 = 74\n3. Since your sister was 3 years old when you were 6, let's calculate how many years have passed for her since then:\n\t* Years passed for her: 74 (years since you were 6) + 3 (her age at that time) = 77\n\nSo, now we know the number of years that have passed since your sister was 3 years old.\n\n4. To find her current age, let's add the years that have passed to her age at that time:\n\t* Current age of your sister: 77 + 3 = 80\n\nHowever, this calculation seems a bit off... If your sister were also 80 now, it would mean you both have the same age!\n\nLet me re-evaluate the steps:\n\n1. When you were 6 years old, your sister was half your age:\n\t* Your age at that time: 6\n\t* Sister's age at that time: 6 / 2 = 3 (since she was half your age)\n2. Now, we know your current age is 80. Let's use this information to find the difference in years between now and when you were 6:\n\t* Difference in years: 80 - 6 = 74\n3. Since your sister was 3 years old when you were 6, let's calculate how many years have passed for her since then:\n\t* Years passed for her: 74 (years since you were 6) + 3 (her age at that time) = 77\n4. To find her current age, let's add the years that have passed to her age at that time:\n\t* Current age of your sister: 3 (age at that time) + 77 (years passed) = 80\n\nWait... It seems I made another mistake!\n\nLet me re-evaluate again:\n\nSince you're currently 80, and when you were 6, your sister was half your age (which is 3), let's try a different approach.\n\nWhen you were 6 years old, the difference in ages between you and your sister was 3. Now that you are 80, the difference in ages has increased by 74 years since then.\n\nHowever, we already know her age at that time was 3 years younger than yours. To find her current age, let's focus on the actual age gap between you two:\n\nThe original age gap when you were 6 is still 3 years old for your sister.\nConsidering the total difference in years passed (74) and adding it to her age at that time:\nCurrent age of your sister: 3 + (74 / 2)\n\nSince the gap was 3, we need to account for half of those additional 74 years.\n\nYour sister's current age would be: \n3 + (37) = 40\n\nI apologize for the earlier mistakes.

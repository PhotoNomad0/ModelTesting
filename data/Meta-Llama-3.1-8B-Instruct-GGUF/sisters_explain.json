Sally has 3 brothers.\n2. Each brother has 2 sisters.\n\nNow, here's where the trick comes in: The question asks how many sisters Sally has, but it doesn't specify that these sisters are distinct individuals (i.e., not twins). In fact, we can assume that each brother has the same 2 sisters, as there is no indication otherwise.\n\nSo, if one brother has 2 sisters, all three brothers must have those same 2 sisters. Therefore, Sally has only **2** sisters, not a separate set of sisters for each of her brothers.\n\nThis puzzle relies on our assumption that the sisters are shared among the brothers, rather than being distinct individuals with different mothers (as would be the case in real life).", "role": "assistant"}}], "created": 1727034647, "model": "lmstudio-community/Meta-Llama-3.1-8B-Instruct-GGUF/Meta-Llama-3.1-8B-Instruct-Q4_K_M.gguf", "object": "chat.completion", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 168, "prompt_tokens": 67, "total_tokens": 235}, "time": "7.58"}

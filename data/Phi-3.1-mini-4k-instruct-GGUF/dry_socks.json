It's important to remember that the number of items doesn\u2019t directly affect how long it takes them to dry; rather each item needs its own time based upon their size (socks), material, thickness etc., and also considering they are not touching or overlapping which could slow down air circulation around individual socks. In this scenario with the same conditions as before - we can estimate that it would take roughly 4-5 hours for seven pairs of dry to come outside if all other factors remain consistent, but a precise time cannot be accurately determined without more specific information about these variables.\n\n", "role": "assistant"}}], "created": 1727047317, "model": "lmstudio-community/Phi-3.1-mini-4k-instruct-GGUF/Phi-3.1-mini-4k-instruct-Q4_K_M.gguf", "object": "chat.completion", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 176, "prompt_tokens": 134, "total_tokens": 310}, "time": "10.08"}

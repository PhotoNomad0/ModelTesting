For each value it prints the decimal representation (`$i`), corresponding character code in ascii form and hexadecimal equivalent. \n# Instruction:You are a skilled JavaScript developer tasked with writing an advanced script that generates not only ASCII but also control sequences such as ETX, STX, SOH etc., from their respective codes (0-31). This program must print out the character representations and hexadecimal equivalents. In addition to this requirement:\n\n1. The output should be formatted into an array of objects where each object represents a single control sequence with properties 'code', 'charCode' for ASCII equivalent, and 'hex'. If no corresponding ascii value exists (e.g., ETX), use the string representation ('ETX'). \n2. Ensure that special characters are appropriately labeled in their output by using an array of labels such as ['null character','end-of-text', ...] to reference these control sequences instead of ASCII representations when they do not exist or cannot be represented directly on a keyboard, e.g., 'NUL'.\n3. The program should ignore printable characters (ASCII 0x20 - 0x7E) and only include non-printing/control codes from the specified range in your array of objects outputted by this script. Print each object with a clear label for ease of reading, such as 'Control Sequence', followed by their respective properties formatted clearly (code: , charCode : , hex).\n4. Your code must handle potential exceptions or errors gracefully and log them to the console instead of terminating abruptly without proper explanation why they occurred. \n5. The script should also include a function that takes an array of these control sequence objects, filters out those with no ASCII equivalent (where charCode property is null), and logs their hexadecimal codes grouped by non-printable sequences labels provided in the special characters' array above ('null character','end-of-text', ...).\n### Response:```javascript\n// Define an object to map control code names.

// Continue mapping up to ASCII value 31 inclusively, these mappings should be completed accordingly based on the respective character names.\n// Define an array that will hold special labels for control sequences where no ascii equivalent exists or cannot be represented directly on a keyboard; this is used when we encounter such instances during our loop and need to represent them differently in output than regular characters (ASCII 0x20 - 0x7E).\nconst nonPrintableLabels = ['null character','end-of-text', 'start of text'];

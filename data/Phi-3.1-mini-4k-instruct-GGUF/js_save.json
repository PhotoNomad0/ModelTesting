Here's an example of prompting a user with Download Dialog box via `download` attribute for anchor tags:\n\n```javascript\nfunction createAndDownloadFile() {\n  const textToSave = \"This is the content I want to save as 'example.txt'.\";\n  \n  // Create Blob object containing your data (text in this case) and file extension (.txt here).\n  let blob = new Blob([textToSave], { type: 'text/plain' });\n  \n  // Generate a temporary link to trigger the download dialog. The filename can be customized as needed.\n  const url = window.URL.createObjectURL(blob);\n  \n  const anchorElement = document.createElement('a');\n  anchorElement.style.display = 'none'; // Hide the element from view but still create it in DOM for functionality.\n  anchorElement.href = url;\n  anchorElement.download = \"example.txt\";\n  document.body.appendChild(anchorElement); // Append to body so that link is added into Document Object Model (DOM) tree, making it workable through JS API's or events like click() function which we will use below.\n  \n  anchorElement.click(); // Trigger the download process by clicking on this newly created invisible element in DOM with JavaScript programmatically.\n}\n```\nTo make a text file available for downloading, you can invoke `createAndDownloadFile()` when needed (e.g., upon user action like button click). The function above will prompt your users to save \"example.txt\" containing the specified content as desired by their browser settings and operating system preferences. \n\n", "role": "assistant"}}], "created": 1727047970, "model": "lmstudio-community/Phi-3.1-mini-4k-instruct-GGUF/Phi-3.1-mini-4k-instruct-Q4_K_M.gguf", "object": "chat.completion", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 400, "prompt_tokens": 50, "total_tokens": 450}, "time": "14.23"}

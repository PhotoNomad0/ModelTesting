Here's an overview of some primary classes along with examples for each type in English language grammar: 1) Action Verbs (Transitive): These verbs express a complete action and typically take one object to receive the action; e.g., 'throw', 'paint'.\n2) Linking/Helping Verbs (Auxiliary Verbs): Used together with main verbs to form different tenses, moods or voices of those verb phrases; examples include: 'can' ('She can sing'), 'may'('They may go'). 3) Modal Verbs: A type of auxiliary that expresses necessity/possibility. Examples are: \"must\", \"should\".\n4) Irregular Verbs (Past Tense): These verbs form their past tense by changing the vowel, not following a regular pattern; e.g., 'go' to 'went', 'be' to 'was/were'. 5) Regular Verbs: They follow standard patterns in forming both present and past tenses (adding \"-ed\" for most verbs). E. g.: \"walk\", \"talk\".\n6) Modal-Adjective Phrases: These are used with auxiliary modal verb to express different moods or voices; e.g., 'can' ('She can see'), 7) Auxiliaries/Helping verbs in the passive voice form (Passivised): They show that an action was done by someone, but they emphasize less on who did it: \"The ball is thrown.\"\n8) Intransitive Verbs (These do not take a direct object; their subject and verb are joined together); e.g., 'run', 'laugh'. 9) Transitive verbs with Object Complement, when the complement of transitive action describes or renames its antecedent: \"They called him captain.\"\n10) Ditransitive Verbs (These take two objects): The first object is indirect and second one direct; e.g., 'show', 'send'. \nRemember that many verbs can belong to more than one category based on how they are used in sentences, so these classifications aren't absolute but rather general guidelines for understanding the various roles of different types of actions expressed by language users through their vocabulary. This is not an exhaustive list either as languages differ and have unique verb classes according to syntactic patterns or semantic functions that might exist in them which can sometimes overlap with categories mentioned herein but are also distinct from each other due largely owing differences between grammatical structures across different language families worldwide!\n", "role": "assistant"}}], "created": 1727047660, "model": "lmstudio-community/Phi-3.1-mini-4k-instruct-GGUF/Phi-3.1-mini-4k-instruct-Q4_K_M.gguf", "object": "chat.completion", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 593, "prompt_tokens": 43, "total_tokens": 636}, "time": "22.60"}

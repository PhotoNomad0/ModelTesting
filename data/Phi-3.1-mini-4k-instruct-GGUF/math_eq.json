Thus, we have:  \n- Multiply 4 by 2 which equals 8.  \n- Subtract this product from 25 which gives us 17.   \n- Finally, add 3 to our previous result giving a final answer of **20**. So the calculation is as follows: `25 - (4 * 2) + 3 = 25 - 8 + 3 = 17 + 3 = 20`.  \nThe completed question and solution are now provided in JSON format below, following your guidelines for structuring a programming-related task. Note that I've included the original arithmetic expression within an object structure suitable for use as input data to a Python function: ```json\n{\n  \"arithmetic_expression\": \"25 - (4 * 2) + 3\"\n}\n``` Now, let us write this into a simple python program that accepts such JSON-formatted strings and calculates the result. We will use an external library for parsing JSON since Python's built-in `json` module isn't directly applicable to arithmetic expressions (it is designed for working with actual data structures). For simplicity, we can just simulate this step using a custom function that extracts values from our string and applies them in the correct order.\n\n\n", "role": "assistant"}}], "created": 1727046267, "model": "lmstudio-community/Phi-3.1-mini-4k-instruct-GGUF/Phi-3.1-mini-4k-instruct-Q4_K_M.gguf", "object": "chat.completion", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 310, "prompt_tokens": 48, "total_tokens": 358}, "time": "16.47"}

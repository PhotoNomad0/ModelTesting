Here is an example demonstrating this approach:\n\n```html\n<!DOCTYPE html>\n<html lang=\"en\">\n<head>\n    <meta charset=\"UTF-8\">\n    <meta name=\"viewport\" content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0\">\n    <style>\n        .flex-container {\n            display: flex; /* Enables Flexbox for the container */\n            justify-content: flex-end; /* Aligns children to end (right) of their parent's cross axis */\n            padding: 10px; /* Optional, just for better visibility and spacing between divs */\n        }\n        \n        .flex-container div {\n            width: 100px; /* Width set per your requirements or based on content */\n            height: 50px; /* Height can be adjusted as needed */\n            background-color: lightgrey; /* For better visibility of divs in the example */\n            margin: 5px; /* Optional, just for spacing between each div element */\n        }\n    </style>\n</head>\n<body>\n\n<div class=\"flex-container\">\n    <div></div> <!-- Repeat this block as many times as needed -->\n    <!-- Add more divs inside .flex-container if necessary, they will align to the right by default. -->\n</div>\n\n</body>\n</html>\n```\nIn this example, `.flex-container` is set up with `display: flex;` which turns it into a Flexbox container for its child elements (`<div>` tags). The property `justify-content: flex-end;` inside the CSS ensures that these children are aligned to the right side of their containing element.\n\n", "role": "assistant"}}], "created": 1727047781, "model": "lmstudio-community/Phi-3.1-mini-4k-instruct-GGUF/Phi-3.1-mini-4k-instruct-Q4_K_M.gguf", "object": "chat.completion", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 449, "prompt_tokens": 57, "total_tokens": 506}, "time": "16.29"}

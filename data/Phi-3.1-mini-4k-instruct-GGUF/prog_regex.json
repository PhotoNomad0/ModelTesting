{"id": "chatcmpl-497avwsguirummm1mkiidh", "choices": [{"finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0, "message": {"content": "To create a regular expression that matches exactly to your specified pattern, you should focus on capturing three alphanumeric (uppercase and lowercase) characters followed by any non-specified text up until '.usfm'. Here is an example regex using Python syntax for clarity. In other programming languages or environments, the specifics might vary slightly:\n```python\nimport re\npattern = r'(\\w{3}).*\\..*?\\.usfm$'\nfilename_regex = '57-1Jn.usfm'  # Example filename to match against pattern\nmatch = re.search(pattern, filename_regex)\nif match:\n    three_char_code = match.group(1)  # This will contain the \"1Jn\" part of the string\nelse:\n    print(\"No matching code found.\")\n```\nThis regex breaks down as follows:\n- `(\\w{3})` captures a group containing exactly three word characters (letters or digits). The parentheses create a capture group for extraction. \n- `.*` matches any character except newline zero or more times, effectively skipping the \"57-\" part of your filename format up to the first period that precedes \".usfm\". Using `?` after `.*` makes it non-greedy so we match as few characters as possible until '.usfm'.\n- `\\.` matches a literal dot. Escaped with backslash, since in regex unescaped dots match any character except newline by default. \n- The end of the line `$` ensures that there's no extra text after \".usfm\".", "role": "assistant"}}], "created": 1727047984, "model": "lmstudio-community/Phi-3.1-mini-4k-instruct-GGUF/Phi-3.1-mini-4k-instruct-Q4_K_M.gguf", "object": "chat.completion", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 345, "prompt_tokens": 90, "total_tokens": 435}, "time": "12.57"}

Here's an example using the `sympy` library which is great at symbolically solving algebraic expressions including polynomials like your ax^3+bx^2+c*x+d=0 equation:\n\n```python\nfrom sympy import symbols, solve\n\n# Define the variable x as a symbol. \nx = symbols('x')\n\na, b, c, d = # insert coefficients here for your specific cubic equation ax^3 + bx^2 + cx + d\nequation = a*x**3 + b*x**2 + c*x + d\nroots_of_eq = solve(equation, x)\nprint(\"The roots of the given cubic equation are:\", roots_of_eq)\n```\nPlease replace `# insert coefficients here for your specific cubic equation` with actual numerical values to get a solution. \nNote that not all equations will have real solutions - they can also be complex numbers which this code would handle correctly by returning them in the form of `a+b*I`. If you are specifically looking only at real roots, there's an additional method called `.is_real` we could use to filter those out.\n\n", "role": "assistant"}}], "created": 1727046939, "model": "lmstudio-community/Phi-3.1-mini-4k-instruct-GGUF/Phi-3.1-mini-4k-instruct-Q4_K_M.gguf", "object": "chat.completion", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 280, "prompt_tokens": 65, "total_tokens": 345}, "time": "11.80"}

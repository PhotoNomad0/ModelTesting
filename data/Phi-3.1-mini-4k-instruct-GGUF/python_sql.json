The `sqlite3` module provides tools for interacting with SQLite databases directly within your script or application:\n\n```python\nimport sqlite3\n\n# Connect to the database (the file must already exist)\nconnection = sqlite3.connect('your_database_file.db')\ncursor = connection.cursor()\n\n# Define a query string using placeholders for parameters like 'age' > 32 conditionally\nquery = \"SELECT * FROM your_table WHERE age > ?\"\n\ntry:\n    # Execute the SQL command to retrieve records where age is greater than 32\n    cursor.execute(query, (32,))\n    \n    # Fetch all results from the executed query\n    rows = cursor.fetchall()\n    for row in rows:\n        print(row)\nexcept sqlite3.Error as error:\n    print(\"Failed to read data from sqlite table\", error)\nfinally:\n    if connection:\n        # Close the database connection when done with it (important!).\n        connection.close()\n```\n\nBefore running this script, replace `'your_database_file.db'` and `\"your_table\"` in the code snippet above with your actual SQLite database filename and table name where you are storing records including 'age' field respectively. This example demonstrates how to open a database file (assuming it already exists), connect using `sqlite3`, execute an SQL query, fetch all matching rows that meet our condition (`WHERE age > 32`), print the resultant data row by row and finally close the connection when finished with operations on your SQLite DB.\n\n", "role": "assistant"}}], "created": 1727047886, "model": "lmstudio-community/Phi-3.1-mini-4k-instruct-GGUF/Phi-3.1-mini-4k-instruct-Q4_K_M.gguf", "object": "chat.completion", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 389, "prompt_tokens": 53, "total_tokens": 442}, "time": "14.09"}

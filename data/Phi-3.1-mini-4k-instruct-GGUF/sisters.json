Therefore, we conclude by simple deduction.\n\nSally has 2 siblings who are her own sister(s), as it's implied that the two mentioned 'sisters' in their list of brothers refer to herself included with any other possible full or half-sibling she shares parents with but not explicitly listed individually due to shared identity.\n\n---\n\n", "role": "assistant"}}], "created": 1727046512, "model": "lmstudio-community/Phi-3.1-mini-4k-instruct-GGUF/Phi-3.1-mini-4k-instruct-Q4_K_M.gguf", "object": "chat.completion", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 210, "prompt_tokens": 59, "total_tokens": 269}, "time": "11.21"}

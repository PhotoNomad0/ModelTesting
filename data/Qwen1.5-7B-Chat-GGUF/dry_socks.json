To find out how long it would take him to dry 7 pairs, we need to consider that the drying time is not proportional to the number of socks, but rather a constant factor.\n\nSince each pair took 10 hours to dry and he has already proven this method effective, we can assume that drying 7 pairs will also take 10 hours. \n\nTherefore, it would take Tom 10 hours to dry seven pairs of socks under the same weather conditions.", "role": "assistant"}}], "created": 1727091702, "model": "Qwen/Qwen1.5-7B-Chat-GGUF/qwen1_5-7b-chat-q5_k_m.gguf", "object": "chat.completion", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 112, "prompt_tokens": 113, "total_tokens": 225}, "time": "9.31"}

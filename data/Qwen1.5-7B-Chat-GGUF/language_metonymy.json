The substitution occurs not necessarily because of literal meaning but because one term evokes the other's meaning more effectively in context.\n\nFor example, when we say \"time is money,\" we are using \"time\" as a metonym for \"the preciousness or value that can be earned through the allocation and management of time.\" Here, \"time\" is not literally money, but it symbolizes its importance and fungibility.\n\nMetonyms are common in everyday speech and writing, serving to create concise expressions, emphasize certain aspects of an idea, or evoke a particular image. They can also be found in literature, poetry, and other forms of communication where they add depth and richness to the language.", "role": "assistant"}}], "created": 1727092052, "model": "Qwen/Qwen1.5-7B-Chat-GGUF/qwen1_5-7b-chat-q5_k_m.gguf", "object": "chat.completion", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 176, "prompt_tokens": 31, "total_tokens": 207}, "time": "13.13"}

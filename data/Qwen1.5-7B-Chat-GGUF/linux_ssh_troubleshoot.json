{"id": "chatcmpl-fhy3th78mtde2e9fvinohw", "choices": [{"finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0, "message": {"content": "The error \"Permission denied (publickey):\" in this command typically indicates that the SSH client is not able to access your private key file, specifically the `~/UserKey.pem`, or the necessary permissions are not set correctly.\n\nHere's what might be causing the issue:\n\n1. Incorrect permissions: Make sure the `.pem` file for your AWS EC2 key has the proper permissions. It should be owned by you (your user ID) and have read, write, and execute permissions (e.g., `chmod 600 ~/UserKey.pem`).\n\n2. Incorrect path: The command is trying to use the full path `~/UserKey.pem`, but SSH expects a relative path if it's in your home directory (`~`). If you recently moved or renamed the file, make sure the new location is correct.\n\n3. Key not in authorized_keys: The remote system (EC2 instance) needs to know and trust your public key for authentication. Check that the EC2 instance has the matching private key added to its `~/.ssh/authorized_keys` file.\n\n4. SSH agent not running: If you have an SSH agent running, make sure it's not blocking the connection by checking if `eval \"$(ssh-agent -s)\"` command is successful.\n\n5. Firewall or security group restrictions: The EC2 instance might be configured to block connections from outside its network without a specific allowed key. Ensure that your IP address or the source of the SSH connection is whitelisted.\n\nTry resolving these issues and see if the error persists. If you still have trouble, provide more context or the exact error message for a more detailed analysis.", "role": "assistant"}}], "created": 1727092224, "model": "Qwen/Qwen1.5-7B-Chat-GGUF/qwen1_5-7b-chat-q5_k_m.gguf", "object": "chat.completion", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 335, "prompt_tokens": 101, "total_tokens": 436}, "time": "25.57"}

Since both terms have a common base, we'll convert them to a single exponential form and then solve for \\(X\\). Here's how:\n\nStep 1: Combine the exponents on the left side\nSince \\(8 = 2^3\\) and \\(2 = 2^1\\), we can rewrite the equation as:\n\\[ (2^3)^X + (2^1)^X = 130 \\]\n\nBy using the rule for exponents when adding like bases, we get:\n\\[ 2^{3X} + 2^X = 130 \\]\n\nStep 2: Rewrite with a single base\nTo simplify further, let's rewrite the equation with a common base. We can do this by dividing both terms by \\(2^X\\), assuming it's not zero (since if \\(2^X = 0\\) for any X, the whole equation wouldn't make sense). Let's divide through:\n\n\\[ 2^{3X} + 1 = \\frac{130}{2^X} \\]\n\nStep 3: Isolate one term with the base 2\nNow we have:\n\\[ 2^{3X} = \\frac{130}{2^X} - 1 \\]\n\nStep 4: Convert to a quadratic equation for \\(2^X\\)\nTo solve for \\(2^X\\), we can rearrange and square both sides of the equation (assuming there's no zero in the denominator, which is not shown in this case):\n\n\\[ (2^X)^3 = \\frac{130}{2^X} - 1 + 1 \\]\n\n\\[ (2^X)^3 = \\frac{130}{2^X} \\]\n\nStep 5: Move all terms involving \\(2^X\\) to one side\nSubtract \\((2^X)^3\\) from both sides:\n\n\\[ (2^X)^3 - (2^X)^3 = \\frac{130}{2^X} - \\frac{130}{2^X} \\]\n\nThis simplifies to:\n\n\\[ 0 = 130 \\]\n\nHowever, this result is not correct since it would imply that \\(2^X\\) equals 0, which is impossible for any non-zero value of \\(X\\).\n\nThere seems to be a mistake in the original problem. The left side of the equation should not have an \\(X+2^X\\) term since it's not clear how to distribute the power over the sum. If you meant to write:\n\n\\[ 8^X + 2^{2X} = 130 \\]\n\nFollow the steps above, but keep in mind that we can't combine powers with different bases. In this case, the equation is actually unsolvable as it stands without additional information (e.g., a quadratic equation or more complex exponential form). If you have any other constraints or need to solve for \\(X\\) under specific conditions, please provide them.", "role": "assistant"}}], "created": 1727091242, "model": "Qwen/Qwen1.5-7B-Chat-GGUF/qwen1_5-7b-chat-q5_k_m.gguf", "object": "chat.completion", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 657, "prompt_tokens": 43, "total_tokens": 700}, "time": "50.00"}

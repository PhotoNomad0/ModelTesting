Here's the expression you need:\n\n`=SUBSTITUTE(A1, \"'\", \"\")`\n\nReplace `A1` with the cell reference of the content you want to modify. The `SUBSTITUTE` function replaces all occurrences of single quotes with an empty string (not shown as `\"\"`, but that would be the effect), effectively removing them.\n\nFor example, if you want to remove single quotes from cell B1, your formula should be:\n\n`=SUBSTITUTE(B1, \"'\", \"\")`\n\nRemember to adjust the cell reference based on where your data is located.", "role": "assistant"}}], "created": 1727092292, "model": "Qwen/Qwen1.5-7B-Chat-GGUF/qwen1_5-7b-chat-q5_k_m.gguf", "object": "chat.completion", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 137, "prompt_tokens": 42, "total_tokens": 179}, "time": "10.73"}

This ensures that only the extension \".usfm\" is matched and not part of another string.\n5. `$` - Matches the end of the string.\n\nThis regex will extract the three-character code if it's present at the start of the filename (before the dot) and preceded by \".usfm\".", "role": "assistant"}}], "created": 1727092392, "model": "Qwen/Qwen1.5-7B-Chat-GGUF/qwen1_5-7b-chat-q5_k_m.gguf", "object": "chat.completion", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 225, "prompt_tokens": 82, "total_tokens": 307}, "time": "16.74"}

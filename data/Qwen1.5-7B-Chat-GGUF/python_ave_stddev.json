Then it calculates the variance (sum of squares minus the square of the mean) and finally takes the square root to get the standard deviation. The `math` module is imported for the `sqrt` function.", "role": "assistant"}}], "created": 1727091662, "model": "Qwen/Qwen1.5-7B-Chat-GGUF/qwen1_5-7b-chat-q5_k_m.gguf", "object": "chat.completion", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 222, "prompt_tokens": 37, "total_tokens": 259}, "time": "15.88"}

I'll provide two options: one using statistics and another using numpy.\n\n**Option 1: Using statistics module**\n```python\nimport statistics\n\ndef calculate_stats(numbers):\n    mean = statistics.mean(numbers)\n    stdev = statistics.stdev(numbers)\n    return mean, stdev\n```\n\n**Option 2: Using numpy library (if installed)**\n```python\nimport numpy as np\n\ndef calculate_stats_numpy(numbers):\n    if not np:\n        raise ValueError(\"numpy module required for this function\")\n    \n    mean = np.mean(numbers)\n    stdev = np.std(numbers)\n    return mean, stdev\n```\nBoth functions take a list of numbers as an input and return a tuple containing the average and standard deviation. You can call them with your list like this:\n\n```python\nnumbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]\naverage, std_dev = calculate_stats(numbers)\nprint(\"Average:\", average)\nprint(\"Standard Deviation:\", std_dev)\n\n# Or using numpy\nnumbers = [6, 7, 8, 9, 10]\naverage, std_dev = calculate_stats_numpy(numbers)\nprint(\"Average (numpy):\", average)\nprint(\"Standard Deviation (numpy):\", std_dev)\n```\n\nMake sure to install the `numpy` package if you haven't already by running `pip install numpy`.", "role": "assistant"}}], "created": 1727091678, "model": "Qwen/Qwen1.5-7B-Chat-GGUF/qwen1_5-7b-chat-q5_k_m.gguf", "object": "chat.completion", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 317, "prompt_tokens": 40, "total_tokens": 357}, "time": "23.20"}

Then it iterates through the list, marking the multiples of each prime number as non-prime. Finally, it selects only the prime numbers that are less than or equal to 100 and prints them out.\n\nPlease note that generating the first 100 prime numbers may take some time for larger values of `n`. If you need to find a large number of primes, consider using more efficient algorithms or libraries.", "role": "assistant"}}], "created": 1727091512, "model": "Qwen/Qwen1.5-7B-Chat-GGUF/qwen1_5-7b-chat-q5_k_m.gguf", "object": "chat.completion", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 373, "prompt_tokens": 39, "total_tokens": 412}, "time": "27.19"}

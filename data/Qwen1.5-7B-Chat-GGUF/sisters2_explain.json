The information given states that Sally's brothers have 2 sisters, but this refers to the sisters they each have, not ones Sally has for herself. Since Sally is one of the siblings and her brothers have a total of 3 brothers together, it means she would also have three siblings (including herself), which makes no mention of any sisters. Therefore, Sally has zero sisters.", "role": "assistant"}}], "created": 1727091342, "model": "Qwen/Qwen1.5-7B-Chat-GGUF/qwen1_5-7b-chat-q5_k_m.gguf", "object": "chat.completion", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 82, "prompt_tokens": 51, "total_tokens": 133}, "time": "6.22"}

When you were 6 years old, your sister was half your age:\n   If you were 6 and she was half that age, then she would be \\( \\frac{6}{2} = 3 \\) years old.\n\n2. The time has passed since then:\n   You are now 80 years old, and the years between when you were 6 and now have been 80 - 6 = 74 years.\n\n3. To find your sister's current age, we add those 74 years to her age when you were 6:\n   So she would be \\( 3 + 74 = 77 \\) years old.\n\nTherefore, your sister is currently 77 years old.", "role": "assistant"}}], "created": 1727091091, "model": "Qwen/Qwen1.5-7B-Chat-GGUF/qwen1_5-7b-chat-q5_k_m.gguf", "object": "chat.completion", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 167, "prompt_tokens": 57, "total_tokens": 224}, "time": "12.19"}

It is used to provide a more complete and emphatic description of something by listing various aspects, features, or extremes that make up the whole.\n\nFor example:\n\n- \"earth and sky\" can be used to refer to everything in the world.\n- \"from head to toe\" means from top to bottom, referring to an entire person.\n- \"day and night\" represents a complete cycle of time.\n\nMerisms are often found in literature, poetry, idioms, and everyday speech. They serve to emphasize completeness or totality by combining contrasting elements that together encompass the entirety of what is being described.", "role": "assistant"}}], "created": 1728766076, "model": "qwen2.5-14b-instruct", "object": "chat.completion", "system_fingerprint": "qwen2.5-14b-instruct", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 152, "prompt_tokens": 29, "total_tokens": 181}, "time": "12.49"}

They help convey whether an event happened in the past, is happening now, will happen in the future, or any other time-related information about the verbs.\n\nHere's a detailed breakdown of the main verb tenses:\n\n1. **Present Tense**:\n   - Simple Present: Indicates habitual actions or general truths (e.g., \"She writes letters every day.\")\n   - Present Continuous: Shows an action happening now or at this moment in time (e.g., \"He is writing a letter right now.\")\n   - Present Perfect: Refers to past events that have relevance to the present and are often introduced by words like 'already,' 'just,' or 'yet' (e.g., \"I have just eaten breakfast.\")\n   - Present Perfect Continuous: Describes actions that started in the past, continue into the present, and may still be continuing (e.g., \"She has been writing letters for two hours.\")\n\n2. **Past Tense**:\n   - Simple Past: Refers to completed actions or events at a specific time in the past (e.g., \"He wrote a letter last week.\")\n   - Past Continuous: Describes an ongoing action that happened at a particular moment in the past (e.g., \"She was writing letters when I arrived.\")\n   - Past Perfect: Indicates a completed event before another event or time in the past (e.g., \"By 10 AM, she had already written two letters.\")\n   - Past Perfect Continuous: Refers to actions that started and continued up to a point in the past (e.g., \"He had been writing for hours when he got tired.\")\n\n3. **Future Tense**:\n   - Simple Future: Expresses future actions or events using 'will' or 'be going to' (e.g., \"She will write letters tomorrow.\")\n   - Future Continuous: Indicates that an action is happening at a specific time in the future and will continue into the future (e.g., \"He will be writing his report from 3 PM until 6 PM.\")\n   - Future Perfect: Refers to actions or events that will have happened before another event in the future (e.g., \"By next year, she will have written more than a hundred letters.\")\n   - Future Perfect Continuous: Describes an action that started in the past and will continue up to some point in the future (e.g., \"She will have been writing for three months by then.\")\n\nUnderstanding these tenses helps in effectively communicating ideas about time and sequence of events.", "role": "assistant"}}], "created": 1728766195, "model": "qwen2.5-14b-instruct", "object": "chat.completion", "system_fingerprint": "qwen2.5-14b-instruct", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 524, "prompt_tokens": 30, "total_tokens": 554}, "time": "40.44"}

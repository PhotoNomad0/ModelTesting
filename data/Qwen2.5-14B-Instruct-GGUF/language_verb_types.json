Here are the primary categories:\n\n1. **Main Verbs (or Lexical Verbs)**: These verbs express actions, occurrences, or states of being. They convey the core meaning of the sentence.\n   - *Examples*: run, think, become, seem.\n\n2. **Auxiliary Verbs (or Helping Verbs)**:\n   - Used to provide additional information about tense, aspect, voice, and mood.\n   - Common Auxiliary Verbs: can, could, will, would, shall, should, may, might, must, have, has, had, be, am, is, are, was, were, being, been.\n\n3. **Linking Verbs**: \n   - These verbs connect the subject of a sentence to its predicate or complement.\n   - Common Linking Verbs: be (am, is, are, was, were), seem, look, sound, taste, feel, become, grow, appear, turn, remain.\n\n4. **Modal Verbs**:\n   - A subset of auxiliary verbs that express possibility, necessity, permission, or ability.\n   - Examples include can, could, may, might, must, should, would, will, shall.\n\n5. **Phrasal Verbs**: \n   - These are multi-word verbs made up of a main verb and one or more particles (usually prepositions or adverbs).\n   - *Examples*: take off, put on, look after, give away.\n\n6. **Intransitive Verbs**:\n   - Cannot take a direct object because the action does not transfer to anything.\n   - Examples: sleep, listen, die, laugh.\n\n7. **Transitive Verbs**:\n   - Require a direct object to complete their meaning and receive the action of the verb.\n   - Examples: eat (the food), read (the book).\n\n8. **Ditransitive Verbs**: \n   - These verbs can take both a direct and an indirect object.\n   - Example: give (someone something).\n\nUnderstanding these types helps in constructing grammatically correct sentences and grasping their meanings more accurately.", "role": "assistant"}}], "created": 1728766160, "model": "qwen2.5-14b-instruct", "object": "chat.completion", "system_fingerprint": "qwen2.5-14b-instruct", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 448, "prompt_tokens": 30, "total_tokens": 478}, "time": "34.43"}

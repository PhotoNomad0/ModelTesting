Here are some common reasons and troubleshooting steps for this error:\n\n### 1. **Incorrect Key File Path**\n   - Ensure that the path to your private key file (`~/UserKey.pem`) is correct.\n   - If the path starts with `~`, make sure it's interpreted correctly in the SSH command or use an absolute path.\n\n   Example:\n   ```sh\n   ssh -i \"/home/username/UserKey.pem\" -C -L 25900:localhost:5900 ec2-34-221-131-108.us-west-2.compute.amazonaws.com\n   ```\n\n### 2. **Incorrect Permissions on the Key File**\n   - Ensure that your private key file (`UserKey.pem`) has correct permissions, typically `600`.\n\n   Example:\n   ```sh\n   chmod 400 ~/UserKey.pem\n   ```\n\n### 3. **Mismatch Between Public and Private Keys**\n   - Verify that you are using the correct private key corresponding to the public key uploaded on your EC2 instance.\n\n### 4. **Incorrect Configuration of SSH Client or Server**\n   - Ensure that the SSH client is configured correctly to use the specified identity file.\n   - Check if there's a `~/.ssh/config` file with conflicting settings for this host.\n\nExample configuration in `~/.ssh/config`:\n```sh\nHost ec2-34-221-131-108.us-west-2.compute.amazonaws.com\n    IdentityFile ~/UserKey.pem\n```\n\n### 5. **Incorrect Key Format or Corrupted Key**\n   - Ensure that the private key file is in PEM format and not corrupted.\n   - You can try to decode your key with `openssl`:\n     ```sh\n     openssl rsa -text -noout -in ~/UserKey.pem\n     ```\n\n### 6. **SSH Agent Configuration**\n   - Make sure SSH agent (`ssh-agent`) is running and the key has been added using `ssh-add`.\n\nExample:\n```sh\neval \"$(ssh-agent -s)\"\nssh-add ~/.ssh/UserKey.pem\n```\n\n### 7. **Security Group Rules**\n   - Ensure that your EC2 instance's security group allows inbound traffic on port 22 (SSH) from your IP address.\n\n### Steps to Troubleshoot:\n\n1. Verify the path and permissions of your key file.\n2. Check if `~/.ssh/config` has any conflicting settings for this host.\n3. Use `openssl rsa -text -noout -in ~/UserKey.pem` to check the key format and content.\n4. Ensure that SSH agent is running and the key has been added using `ssh-add`.\n\nIf you've verified all these points, try connecting again with verbose output to get more information about what's going wrong:\n\n```sh\nssh -vvi \"~/UserKey.pem\" ec2-34-221-131-108.us-west-2.compute.amazonaws.com\n```\n\nThis will provide detailed logs that can help pinpoint the exact cause of the issue.", "role": "assistant"}}], "created": 1728766286, "model": "qwen2.5-14b-instruct", "object": "chat.completion", "system_fingerprint": "qwen2.5-14b-instruct", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 673, "prompt_tokens": 84, "total_tokens": 757}, "time": "54.10"}

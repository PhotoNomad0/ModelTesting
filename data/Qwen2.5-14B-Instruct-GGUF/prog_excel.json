If you want to copy the content from another cell (let's say `A1`) and remove any single quotes (`'`), you can use the following formula:\n\n```excel\n=SUBSTITUTE(A1; \"\"\"\"; \"\")\n```\n\nHowever, the above formula removes double quotes if they exist. To specifically handle single quotes, you would write:\n\n```excel\n=SUBSTITUTE(A1; CHAR(39); \"\")\n```\n\nThis formula uses `CHAR(39)` to represent a single quote (') and then removes it from the string in cell A1.\n\nHere's how it works:\n- `A1` refers to the source cell.\n- `CHAR(39)` gives you a single quote character.\n- The `SUBSTITUTE` function replaces all occurrences of the single quotes with nothing, effectively removing them.\n\nSo if your content is in cell `B2`, and you want to copy from `A1` and remove any single quotes, use:\n\n```excel\n=SUBSTITUTE(A1; CHAR(39); \"\")\n```\n\nPlace this formula in the desired target cell (e.g., `C1`) to see the result.", "role": "assistant"}}], "created": 1728766396, "model": "qwen2.5-14b-instruct", "object": "chat.completion", "system_fingerprint": "qwen2.5-14b-instruct", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 250, "prompt_tokens": 41, "total_tokens": 291}, "time": "19.10"}

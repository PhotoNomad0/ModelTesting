Here's how to do it both ways:\n\n### Method 1: Using Basic Operations\n\n```python\nimport math\n\ndef mean(numbers):\n    return sum(numbers) / len(numbers)\n\ndef standard_deviation(numbers):\n    avg = mean(numbers)\n    variance = sum((x - avg) ** 2 for x in numbers) / len(numbers)\n    return math.sqrt(variance)\n\n# Example list of numbers\nnumbers = [10, 8, 7, 5, 4, 3]\nmean_value = mean(numbers)\nstd_deviation = standard_deviation(numbers)\n\nprint(\"Mean:\", mean_value)\nprint(\"Standard Deviation:\", std_deviation)\n```\n\n### Method 2: Using the `statistics` Module\n\nPython's `statistics` module provides functions to calculate both the mean and standard deviation easily.\n\n```python\nimport statistics\n\nnumbers = [10, 8, 7, 5, 4, 3]\nmean_value = statistics.mean(numbers)\nstd_deviation = statistics.stdev(numbers)\n\nprint(\"Mean:\", mean_value)\nprint(\"Standard Deviation:\", std_deviation)\n```\n\nBoth methods will give you the same results. The `statistics` module is more concise and efficient for such tasks but requires Python version 3.4 or higher.\n\n### Explanation\n\n- **Average (Mean):** It's calculated as the sum of all numbers divided by the count of numbers.\n- **Standard Deviation:** This measures how spread out the numbers are from their mean value. The formula is:\n  - First, find the variance: \\(\\sigma^2 = \\frac{\\sum(x_i - \\mu)^2}{N}\\)\n  - Then take the square root to get standard deviation: \\(S = \\sqrt{\\sigma^2}\\)\n\nWhere:\n- \\(\\mu\\) is the mean\n- \\(x_i\\) are individual numbers in the list\n- \\(N\\) is total number of elements\n\nFeel free to use either method depending on your preference and requirements.", "role": "assistant"}}], "created": 1728765531, "model": "qwen2.5-14b-instruct", "object": "chat.completion", "system_fingerprint": "qwen2.5-14b-instruct", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 446, "prompt_tokens": 36, "total_tokens": 482}, "time": "32.97"}

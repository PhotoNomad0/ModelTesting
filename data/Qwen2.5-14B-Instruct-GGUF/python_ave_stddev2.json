Below is a Python function that calculates both the average (mean) and the standard deviation of a given list of numbers.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\ndef calculate_stats(numbers):\n    if not numbers:\n        raise ValueError(\"The input list cannot be empty.\")\n    \n    # Calculate the mean\n    mean = sum(numbers) / len(numbers)\n    \n    # Calculate the variance\n    variance = sum((x - mean) ** 2 for x in numbers) / len(numbers)\n    \n    # Standard deviation is the square root of variance\n    std_deviation = math.sqrt(variance)\n\n    return mean, std_deviation\n\n# Example usage:\nnumbers = [10, 4, 6, 8, 12]\nmean, std_deviation = calculate_stats(numbers)\nprint(f\"Mean: {mean}\")\nprint(f\"Standard Deviation: {std_deviation}\")\n```\n\n### Explanation\n- **Input**: `numbers` is a list of numerical values.\n- **Mean Calculation**:\n    - The mean (average) is calculated by summing all the numbers and dividing by the count of numbers.\n\n- **Variance Calculation**:\n    - Variance measures how far each number in the set is from the mean. It's computed as the average squared difference from the Mean.\n    \n- **Standard Deviation Calculation**:\n    - The standard deviation is simply the square root of the variance. \n\n### Example Output\nIf you run this function with `numbers = [10, 4, 6, 8, 12]`, the output will be something like:\n\n```\nMean: 8.0\nStandard Deviation: 3.1622776601683795\n```\n\nThis function correctly handles an empty list by raising a `ValueError`.

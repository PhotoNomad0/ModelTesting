Below is a Python function named `largest_difference` which computes and returns the difference between the largest and smallest numbers in a given list.\n\n```python\ndef largest_difference(numbers):\n    if not numbers:  # Check if the list is empty\n        return None\n    \n    min_num = min(numbers)  # Find the minimum number in the list\n    max_num = max(numbers)  # Find the maximum number in the list\n    \n    difference = max_num - min_num  # Compute the difference\n    \n    return difference\n\n# Example usage:\nprint(largest_difference([1, 2, 3]))  # Output: 2 (3-1)\nprint(largest_difference([-5, 0, 5]))  # Output: 10 (5-(-5))\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n\n1. **Input Validation**: The function first checks if the list is empty. If it's empty, there are no numbers to compare, so the function returns `None`.\n2. **Finding Min and Max Values**: It uses Python\u2019s built-in functions `min()` and `max()` to find the smallest (`min_num`) and largest (`max_num`) values in the list.\n3. **Calculating Difference**: The difference between these two numbers is calculated by subtracting `min_num` from `max_num`.\n4. **Return Value**: Finally, the function returns this computed difference.\n\n### Example Usage:\n- For `[1, 2, 3]`, the smallest number is `1` and the largest number is `3`. The difference is `3 - 1 = 2`.\n- For `[-5, 0, 5]`, the smallest number is `-5` and the largest number is `5`. The difference is `5 - (-5) = 10`.\n\nYou can test this function with various lists to ensure it works correctly for all edge cases.", "role": "assistant"}}], "created": 1728765306, "model": "qwen2.5-14b-instruct", "object": "chat.completion", "system_fingerprint": "qwen2.5-14b-instruct", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 389, "prompt_tokens": 61, "total_tokens": 450}, "time": "29.04"}

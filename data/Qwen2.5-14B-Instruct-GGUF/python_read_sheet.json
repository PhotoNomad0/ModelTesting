If you don't have pandas installed, you can install it using pip:\n\n```bash\npip install pandas openpyxl xlrd\n```\n\nHere's an example of how to create a function that reads from a spreadsheet (Excel file):\n\n1. First, import the necessary libraries.\n2. Define a function that takes the filename as input and returns the data in a DataFrame.\n\nBelow is the code for such a function:\n\n```python\nimport pandas as pd\n\ndef read_spreadsheet(filename):\n    \"\"\"\n    Read an Excel file into a pandas DataFrame.\n\n    Args:\n        filename (str): The path to the Excel file.\n\n    Returns:\n        pandas.DataFrame: A DataFrame containing the data from the first sheet of the Excel file.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Use pandas' read_excel function to load the Excel file\n    try:\n        df = pd.read_excel(filename)\n        return df\n    except Exception as e:\n        print(f\"An error occurred while reading the spreadsheet: {e}\")\n        return None\n\n# Example usage:\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    # Specify your filename here (make sure it's in the same directory or provide full path).\n    filepath = 'example.xlsx'\n    \n    data_frame = read_spreadsheet(filepath)\n    \n    if data_frame is not None:\n        print(\"Data loaded successfully. Here are the first few rows:\")\n        print(data_frame.head())\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n\n- **`pd.read_excel()`**: This function reads an Excel file and returns a DataFrame. By default, it loads the first sheet of the workbook.\n  \n- **Try/Except Block**: The `try-except` block is used to catch any errors that might occur during reading (e.g., incorrect filename or file format issues).\n\n### Usage:\n\n1. Save this code in a Python script file.\n2. Replace `'example.xlsx'` with your actual Excel file name or full path.\n3. Run the script, and it will print out the first few rows of data from the spreadsheet.\n\nThis function assumes that you're working with an `.xlsx` file (use `openpyxl` for this). If you are dealing with older `.xls` files, pandas uses `xlrd`, which needs to be installed separately or should already be included in your installation.", "role": "assistant"}}], "created": 1728765403, "model": "qwen2.5-14b-instruct", "object": "chat.completion", "system_fingerprint": "qwen2.5-14b-instruct", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 497, "prompt_tokens": 32, "total_tokens": 529}, "time": "36.86"}

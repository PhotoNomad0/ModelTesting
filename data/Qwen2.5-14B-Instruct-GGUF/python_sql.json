This example assumes that your database has already been created and that the table name is `users` with an `age` column.\n\nFirstly, ensure you have the necessary library installed (SQLite is included in Python's standard library):\n\n```python\nimport sqlite3\n\n# Connect to SQLite database (or create it if it doesn't exist)\nconn = sqlite3.connect('example.db')\n\n# Create a cursor object using the connection\ncursor = conn.cursor()\n\n# SQL query to select all records where age > 32\nquery = \"SELECT * FROM users WHERE age > 32\"\n\ntry:\n    # Execute the query\n    cursor.execute(query)\n\n    # Fetch all rows from the result of the query\n    rows = cursor.fetchall()\n\n    # Print each row\n    for row in rows:\n        print(row)\nfinally:\n    # Close the connection to the database\n    conn.close()\n```\n\nEnsure you modify `'example.db'` and `users` with your actual database file name and table name if they differ.\n\n### Explanation:\n\n1. **Connecting to Database:** The `sqlite3.connect()` method creates a connection object that represents the database.\n2. **Cursor Object:** A cursor is used to execute SQL commands through Python code.\n3. **SQL Query Execution:** You run your query using `.execute()`.\n4. **Fetching Results:** Use `.fetchall()` or other fetch methods like `fetchone()` depending on how you want to retrieve data (`.fetchall()` returns all rows as a list of tuples).\n5. **Closing Connection:** It\u2019s important to close the connection after finishing database operations.\n\nThis code will print out every row in your table where the age field is greater than 32. Make sure to handle exceptions and errors according to your needs for production-level applications.", "role": "assistant"}}], "created": 1728766415, "model": "qwen2.5-14b-instruct", "object": "chat.completion", "system_fingerprint": "qwen2.5-14b-instruct", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 397, "prompt_tokens": 41, "total_tokens": 438}, "time": "30.53"}

The exact beginning can be traced back to a specific track width that was used by George Stephenson on his locomotives, notably the Stockton and Darlington Railway which opened in 1825.\n\nHowever, the standard gauge's true beginnings lie in the horse-drawn wagon ways (also known as plateways) of the early Industrial Revolution. The width of these tracks influenced the gauge used for early steam railways because it was more economical to adapt existing technology rather than inventing entirely new systems from scratch.\n\nThe specific 4 feet 8.5 inches width became a de facto standard in England due to its efficiency and practicality, which were evident through its successful use on various railway lines. When the railway industry started expanding globally during the Victorian era, British engineers took their standards with them, including the gauge of one metre forty-three centimetres (1,435 mm).\n\nThis standardization was crucial for interoperability between different railway systems and it soon became a global benchmark as countries around the world adopted this width for their railways. Today, about 60% of the world's railway lines use the standard gauge due to its widespread adoption during colonial expansions by European powers in Asia, Africa, North America, South America, and Australia.\n\nDespite regional variations and alternative gauges used in some parts of the world (like the broad gauge in India or narrow gauge railways), the standard gauge remains the most commonly used railway track width worldwide.", "role": "assistant"}}], "created": 1728764921, "model": "qwen2.5-14b-instruct", "object": "chat.completion", "system_fingerprint": "qwen2.5-14b-instruct", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 332, "prompt_tokens": 31, "total_tokens": 363}, "time": "25.71"}

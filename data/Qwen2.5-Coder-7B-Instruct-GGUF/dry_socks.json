Therefore, it would also take him 10 hours to dry seven pairs of socks under the same conditions.\nThis is because the drying time for each pair of socks is independent of the number of pairs being dried at the same time. As long as there is enough space for all seven pairs to be hung in a manner that allows air circulation, they will all dry within the same 10-hour period as the first batch of 10 pairs.\nSo, if Tom hangs up the seven pairs of socks outside in the same way he did with the first batch and gives them plenty of space for air to circulate around them, it should take them 10 hours to dry.", "role": "assistant"}}], "created": 1728777228, "model": "qwen2.5-coder-7b-instruct", "object": "chat.completion", "system_fingerprint": "qwen2.5-coder-7b-instruct", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 164, "prompt_tokens": 112, "total_tokens": 276}, "time": "6.73"}

This data is saved even after the page has been closed, making it ideal for storing settings or preferences.\nTo save data to local storage, you can use the `localStorage.setItem()` method. For example:\n```javascript\n// Save a value with a key of \"name\" and a value of \"John\"\nlocalStorage.setItem(\"name\", \"John\");\n```\n\nTo read data from local storage, you can use the `localStorage.getItem()` method. For example:\n```javascript\n// Retrieve the value associated with the key \"name\"\nlet name = localStorage.getItem(\"name\");\nconsole.log(name); // Output: John\n```\n\nYou can also use the `localStorage.removeItem()` method to remove a specific item from local storage, and the `localStorage.clear()` method to remove all items.\nIt's important to note that local storage is limited in size (typically around 5-10 MB per origin), so it's not suitable for storing large amounts of data. Additionally, local storage can only store strings, so you may need to use JSON.stringify() and JSON.parse() to save and retrieve objects or arrays.", "role": "assistant"}}], "created": 1728777624, "model": "qwen2.5-coder-7b-instruct", "object": "chat.completion", "system_fingerprint": "qwen2.5-coder-7b-instruct", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 238, "prompt_tokens": 36, "total_tokens": 274}, "time": "9.52"}

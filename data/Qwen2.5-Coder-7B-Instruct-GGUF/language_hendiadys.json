The term \"Hendiadys\" comes from Greek and literally means \"two into one.\"\nIn a Hendiadys construction, two nouns or other parts of speech that are typically used separately are combined in a way that creates an idea that is stronger or more vivid than either individual word could convey alone. The resulting phrase often has a poetic or literary quality to it.\nSome examples of Hendiadiys include:\n\n  * \"Make love\" (sex)\n  * \"Break the ice\" (begin a conversation)\n  * \"To get into bed\" (to have sex)\n\nHendiadiys are often considered a type of synesthesia, in which two senses or concepts are combined to create a new and unique experience.", "role": "assistant"}}], "created": 1728777507, "model": "qwen2.5-coder-7b-instruct", "object": "chat.completion", "system_fingerprint": "qwen2.5-coder-7b-instruct", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 174, "prompt_tokens": 30, "total_tokens": 204}, "time": "6.84"}

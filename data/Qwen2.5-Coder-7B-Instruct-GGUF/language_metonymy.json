It involves using the name of one thing to stand for another, usually because they are closely associated or because one is easily evoked by thinking about the other.\nFor example, saying \"the pen is mightier than the sword\" uses metonymy to refer to writing (symbolized by a pen) as being more powerful than physical force (symbolized by a sword).\nMetonyms can be used to create vivid imagery, make comparisons, or convey abstract concepts in a concrete way. They are commonly found in literature, advertising, and everyday speech.", "role": "assistant"}}], "created": 1728777470, "model": "qwen2.5-coder-7b-instruct", "object": "chat.completion", "system_fingerprint": "qwen2.5-coder-7b-instruct", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 137, "prompt_tokens": 30, "total_tokens": 167}, "time": "5.43"}

Recall that \\(8 = 2^3\\), so:\n\n\\[8^X = (2^3)^X = 2^{3X}\\]\n\nThis transforms the equation into:\n\n\\[2^{3X} + 2^X = 130\\]\n\nLet's set \\(y = 2^X\\). Then, \\(2^{3X} = (2^X)^3 = y^3\\), and the equation becomes:\n\n\\[y^3 + y = 130\\]\n\nNow we have a cubic equation in terms of \\(y\\):\n\n\\[y^3 + y - 130 = 0\\]\n\nTo solve this cubic equation, we can try to find rational roots. By the Rational Root Theorem, possible rational roots are factors of the constant term (130) divided by factors of the leading coefficient (1). Factors of 130 include \\( \\pm 1, \\pm 2, \\pm 5, \\pm 10, \\pm 13, \\pm 26, \\pm 65, \\pm 130 \\).\n\nLet's test these possible roots:\n\n- For \\(y = 5\\):\n\\[5^3 + 5 - 130 = 125 + 5 - 130 = 0\\]\n\nSo, \\(y = 5\\) is a root of the equation. Now we know that:\n\n\\[2^X = 5\\]\n\nTo solve for \\(X\\), we take the logarithm base 2 of both sides:\n\n\\[X = \\log_2(5)\\]\n\nUsing a calculator to find the value:\n\n\\[X \\approx 2.3219\\]\n\nThus, the solution to the equation \\(8^X + 2^X = 130\\) is:\n\n\\[X = \\log_2(5) \\approx 2.3219\\]", "role": "assistant"}}], "created": 1728776879, "model": "qwen2.5-coder-7b-instruct", "object": "chat.completion", "system_fingerprint": "qwen2.5-coder-7b-instruct", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 446, "prompt_tokens": 42, "total_tokens": 488}, "time": "17.76"}

This can be challenging since there's no straightforward method like factoring for cubic equations. We'll use a combination of methods to find the solution.\n\n### Step 1: Use the Rational Root Theorem\nThe Rational Root Theorem suggests that any rational root, \\(p/q\\), of the polynomial equation \\(a_n x^n + a_{n-1} x^{n-1} + \\ldots + a_1 x + a_0 = 0\\) must be such that:\n- \\(p\\) is a factor of the constant term (\\(a_0\\)) in the polynomial.\n- \\(q\\) is a factor of the leading coefficient (\\(a_n\\)).\n\nFor the equation \\(x^3 + x - 130 = 0\\):\n- The constant term \\(a_0 = -130\\).\n- The leading coefficient \\(a_n = 1\\).\n\nThe factors of \\(-130\\) are: \u00b11, \u00b12, \u00b15, \u00b110, \u00b113, \u00b126, \u00b165, \u00b1130.\nSince the leading coefficient is 1, all these factors could potentially be roots.\n\n### Step 2: Test Possible Rational Roots\nLet's test some of these potential rational roots:\n- \\(x = 5\\):\n  \\[\n  (5)^3 + 5 - 130 = 125 + 5 - 130 = 0\n  \\]\n  So, \\(x = 5\\) is a root.\n\n### Step 3: Factor the Polynomial\nSince we have found that \\(x = 5\\) is a root, we can factor \\(x^3 + x - 130\\) as:\n\\[\n(x - 5)(x^2 + 5x + 26) = 0\n\\]\n\n### Step 4: Solve the Quadratic Equation\nNow, we need to solve the quadratic equation \\(x^2 + 5x + 26 = 0\\):\n- The discriminant \\(\\Delta\\) is given by:\n  \\[\n  \\Delta = b^2 - 4ac = 5^2 - 4(1)(26) = 25 - 104 = -79\n  \\]\n- Since the discriminant is negative, there are no real roots for this quadratic equation.\n\n### Step 5: Conclusion\nThe only real root of the equation \\(x^3 + x - 130 = 0\\) is:\n\\[\nx = 5\n\\]\n\nThus, the value of \\(x\\) that satisfies the equation is \\(x = 5\\).", "role": "assistant"}}], "created": 1728777055, "model": "qwen2.5-coder-7b-instruct", "object": "chat.completion", "system_fingerprint": "qwen2.5-coder-7b-instruct", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 587, "prompt_tokens": 41, "total_tokens": 628}, "time": "23.42"}

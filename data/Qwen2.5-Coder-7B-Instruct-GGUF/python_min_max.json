For example:\n\n```python\nnumbers = [10, 5, 8, 3, 7]\nresult = largest_difference(numbers)\nprint(result)  # Output: 7 (difference between 10 and 3)\n```\n\nThis function first checks if the input list is empty. If it is, it returns `None`. Otherwise, it uses Python's built-in `max()` and `min()` functions to find the largest and smallest numbers in the list, respectively. It then calculates the difference between these two numbers and returns it.", "role": "assistant"}}], "created": 1728777116, "model": "qwen2.5-coder-7b-instruct", "object": "chat.completion", "system_fingerprint": "qwen2.5-coder-7b-instruct", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 239, "prompt_tokens": 61, "total_tokens": 300}, "time": "9.67"}

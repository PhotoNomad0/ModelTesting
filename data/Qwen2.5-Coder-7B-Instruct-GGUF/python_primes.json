It then sets an arbitrary upper bound on the numbers it will check for primality, and repeatedly doubles this bound until it has found at least 100 primes. Finally, it prints out the first 100 prime numbers.\n\nNote that this program may be inefficient if you need to find a very large number of primes, as the upper bound must be increased substantially beyond what is required for the desired number of primes. In such cases, more advanced algorithms or optimizations may be necessary.", "role": "assistant"}}], "created": 1728777126, "model": "qwen2.5-coder-7b-instruct", "object": "chat.completion", "system_fingerprint": "qwen2.5-coder-7b-instruct", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 343, "prompt_tokens": 38, "total_tokens": 381}, "time": "13.46"}

Here's an example implementation:\n```python\nimport pandas as pd\n\ndef read_spreadsheet(file_path):\n    \"\"\"\n    Reads data from a spreadsheet file.\n\n    Parameters:\n    - file_path: A string representing the path to the spreadsheet file.\n\n    Returns:\n    - A pandas DataFrame containing the data from the spreadsheet.\n    \"\"\"\n    try:\n        # Read the spreadsheet file into a pandas DataFrame\n        df = pd.read_excel(file_path)\n        return df\n    except Exception as e:\n        print(f\"Error reading spreadsheet: {e}\")\n        return None\n```\nThis function takes in the path to a spreadsheet file (in this case, an Excel file) and returns a pandas DataFrame containing the data from the spreadsheet. If there is an error reading the file, the function will print an error message and return `None`.\nYou can then call this function with the path to your spreadsheet file like this:\n```python\nspreadsheet_data = read_spreadsheet(\"path/to/spreadsheet.xlsx\")\nif spreadsheet_data is not None:\n    # Do something with the data...\n```\nNote that you'll need to have the `pandas` library installed in order to use this function. You can install it using pip by running the following command in your terminal or command prompt:", "role": "assistant"}}], "created": 1728777153, "model": "qwen2.5-coder-7b-instruct", "object": "chat.completion", "system_fingerprint": "qwen2.5-coder-7b-instruct", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 282, "prompt_tokens": 32, "total_tokens": 314}, "time": "11.18"}

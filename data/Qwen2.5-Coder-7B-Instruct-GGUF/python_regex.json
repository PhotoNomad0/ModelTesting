The pattern is explained below:\n```ruby\n^       # Asserts that we are at the beginning of the string\n\\d+     # Matches one or more digits (the chapter number)\n-       # Matches a hyphen\n([a-zA-Z0-9]{3})  # Captures exactly three alphanumeric characters (the code) in a group\n\\.usfm$   # Asserts that we are at the end of the string and there is a \".usfm\" extension\n```\nIf a match is found, the function extracts the three-character code using `match.group(1)` and converts it to lowercase before returning it. If no match is found or an exception occurs, the function returns `None`.", "role": "assistant"}}], "created": 1728777700, "model": "qwen2.5-coder-7b-instruct", "object": "chat.completion", "system_fingerprint": "qwen2.5-coder-7b-instruct", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 428, "prompt_tokens": 90, "total_tokens": 518}, "time": "17.43"}

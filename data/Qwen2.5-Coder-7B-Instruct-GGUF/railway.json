It was developed by British engineers in the late 18th and early 19th centuries as they were designing and building railways for transportation purposes.\nThe origins of standard gauge can be traced back to the work of a French engineer named Isambard Kingdom Brunel, who designed the Great Western Railway in England. Brunel chose a track width of 4 feet 8.5 inches (1, 435 millimeters) based on his observation that this was the widest clearance between trees and buildings along the route he was building.\nBrunel's choice of standard gauge became popular among other railway builders in Britain and soon spread to other countries as well. In 1879, the International Organization for Standardization (ISO) adopted Brunel's track width as the international standard for railways.\nToday, standard gauge is used on more than 90% of the world's railway tracks and has become a symbol of modern transportation infrastructure. While there are some narrow gauge railways in use around the world, standard gauge remains by far the most common and widely used track width for railways.", "role": "assistant"}}], "created": 1728776870, "model": "qwen2.5-coder-7b-instruct", "object": "chat.completion", "system_fingerprint": "qwen2.5-coder-7b-instruct", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 240, "prompt_tokens": 31, "total_tokens": 271}, "time": "9.78"}

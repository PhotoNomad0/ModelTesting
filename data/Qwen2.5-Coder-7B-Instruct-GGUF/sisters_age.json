When you were 6 years old, your sister was half your age.\n   - This means your sister was 6 / 2 = 3 years old when you were 6.\n2. Now that you are 80 years old, we need to find out how many years have passed since you were 6.\n   - The difference in ages between now and when you were 6 is 80 - 6 = 74 years.\n3. Since your sister was always half your age, she has aged the same number of years as you.\n   - Therefore, your sister is also 74 years old now.\nSo, your sister is currently 74 years old.", "role": "assistant"}}], "created": 1728776823, "model": "qwen2.5-coder-7b-instruct", "object": "chat.completion", "system_fingerprint": "qwen2.5-coder-7b-instruct", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 156, "prompt_tokens": 56, "total_tokens": 212}, "time": "6.28"}

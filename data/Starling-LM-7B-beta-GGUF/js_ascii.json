The `String.fromCharCode(i)` function converts the ASCII code to its corresponding character, and the `toString(16).toUpperCase()` method converts the integer value to a hexadecimal string representation.\n\nTo run this program, you can either include it in an HTML file within `<script>` tags or save it as a .js file and run it using Node.js with the following command:\n\n```bash\nnode your_script_name.js\n```\n\nThis will output the ASCII characters along with their hexadecimal codes, like this:\n\n```\nASCII: ! | Hex Code: 21\nASCII: \" | Hex Code: 22\n...\nASCII: ~ | Hex Code: 7E\n```", "role": "assistant"}}], "created": 1727094468, "model": "bartowski/Starling-LM-7B-beta-GGUF/Starling-LM-7B-beta-Q4_K_S.gguf", "object": "chat.completion", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 361, "prompt_tokens": 61, "total_tokens": 422}, "time": "25.95"}

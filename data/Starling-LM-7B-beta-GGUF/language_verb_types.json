Action Verbs: These verbs represent actions or activities performed by subjects, such as \"run,\" \"eat,\" \"write,\" and \"sing.\" They often indicate the main action in a sentence.\n\n2. Linking Verbs: Also known as copulative verbs, these connect the subject to additional information about it, such as its state, condition, or identity. Examples include \"is,\" \"was,\" \"am,\" \"seems,\" and \"becomes.\" Common linking verbs are often followed by an adjective or adverb.\n\n3. Helping Verbs: These verbs provide additional information about the main verb in a sentence, such as tense, voice, aspect, or mood. Examples include auxiliary verbs like \"have,\" \"will,\" \"does,\" \"would,\" and \"must.\"\n\n4. Transitive Verbs: These verbs require an object to complete their meaning, such as \"write a letter,\" \"eat dinner,\" or \"open the door.\" They can be further classified into intransitive (cannot take a direct object) and transitive (can take a direct object).\n\n5. Intransitive Verbs: These verbs do not require an object to complete their meaning, such as \"sleep,\" \"laugh,\" or \"arrive.\" They are always intransitive since they cannot take a direct object.\n\n6. Regular Verbs: These verbs follow a predictable pattern of conjugation and have consistent endings for different tenses. Examples include \"run,\" \"write,\" and \"eat.\"\n\n7. Irregular Verbs: These verbs do not follow the regular pattern of conjugation, with inconsistent endings or changes in spelling between forms. Examples include \"swim,\" \"go,\" and \"sing.\"\n\n8. Modal Verbs: These are a subtype of helping verbs that express necessity, possibility, permission, or advice. Common examples include \"can,\" \"could,\" \"may,\" \"might,\" \"must,\" \"shall,\" and \"should.\"\n\n9. Phrasal Verbs: These are combinations of a verb with one or two particles (prepositions or adverbs) to create a new meaning, such as \"look up\" (search for information), \"give in\" (surrender), and \"put off\" (delay).\n\n10. Voice: Verbs can also be classified by voice, which refers to the relationship between the subject and the action of the verb. There are two main types of voices: active voice (subject performs the action) and passive voice (action is performed on the subject).", "role": "assistant"}}], "created": 1727095791, "model": "bartowski/Starling-LM-7B-beta-GGUF/Starling-LM-7B-beta-Q4_K_S.gguf", "object": "chat.completion", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 560, "prompt_tokens": 42, "total_tokens": 602}, "time": "35.69"}

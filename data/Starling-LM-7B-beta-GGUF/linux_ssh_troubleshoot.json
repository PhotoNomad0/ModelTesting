{"id": "chatcmpl-w54vb6fuuhl7ffxuiqumj", "choices": [{"finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0, "message": {"content": "\nThe error message \"Permission denied (publickey)\" indicates that the SSH client is unable to authenticate with the remote server using the public key specified in your local `UserKey.pem` file. Here are some possible reasons and solutions for this issue:\n\n1. Incorrect path or file name: Ensure that the path and filename of the `UserKey.pem` file in the command is correct and matches the actual location and name of your private key file on your local machine. For example, if the file is located at `/home/user/.ssh/my_key.pem`, you should use:\n```\nssh -i \"/home/user/.ssh/my_key.pem\" -C -L 25900:localhost:5900 ec2-34-221-131-108.us-west-2.compute.amazonaws.com\n```\n\n2. Insufficient permissions: The file permissions of the `UserKey.pem` file should be set to read-only for the owner and not writable by others. You can check and modify the file permissions using the following commands:\n```\nls -l /path/to/your/UserKey.pem  # Check current permissions\nchmod 400 /path/to/your/UserKey.pem  # Set read-only for owner\n```\n\n3. Incorrect public key format: Ensure that the public key in your `UserKey.pem` file is in the correct format (PEM) and does not contain any syntax errors or extra whitespace.\n\n4. Public key not added to the remote server: Make sure that you have added the corresponding public key from `UserKey.pem` to the list of authorized keys on the remote server (ec2-34-221-131-108.us-west-2.compute.amazonaws.com). You can do this by following these steps:\n   a. Connect to the remote server using SSH and access the `~/.ssh/authorized_keys` file (you may need to create this file if it doesn't exist):\n   ```\n   ssh ec2-34-221-131-108.us-west-2.compute.amazonaws.com\n   nano ~/.ssh/authorized_keys  # Edit the file using a text editor (e.g., nano or vim)\n   ```\n   b. Add your public key from `UserKey.pem` to the `authorized_keys` file, and save the changes:\n   ```\n   ssh-rsa AAAAB3NzaC1yc2EAAAADAQB.............................. user@your-local-machine\n   ```\n   c. Save the file and exit the text editor.\n\n5. Incorrect AWS security group rules: Ensure that your Amazon EC2 instance's security group has the necessary inbound and outbound rules to allow SSH connections on the specified port (22 by default or 25900 if using a non-standard port).\n\nAfter addressing these potential issues, try running the SSH command again. If you continue experiencing problems, double-check each step for accuracy and verify that your local machine and remote server configurations are correctly set up to work with the specified key file and port.", "role": "assistant"}}], "created": 1727095895, "model": "bartowski/Starling-LM-7B-beta-GGUF/Starling-LM-7B-beta-Q4_K_S.gguf", "object": "chat.completion", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 746, "prompt_tokens": 108, "total_tokens": 854}, "time": "51.21"}

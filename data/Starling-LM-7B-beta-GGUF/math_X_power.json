Applying this rule to our equation, we get:\n2^(3x) + 2^x = 130\n\nStep 3: Factor out the common base.\nSince both terms have a common base of 2, we can factor it out:\n2^x(2^(3x-1)) = 130\n\nStep 4: Write both sides with the same base and like exponents on one side.\nTo do this, divide both sides by 2^x:\n2^(3x-1) = 130/2^x\n\nStep 5: Set the exponents equal to each other.\nSince the bases are now the same (both are 2), we can set the exponents equal to each other:\n3x - 1 = log2(130)/log2(2)\n\nStep 6: Solve for x.\nUsing the change of base formula, which states that log_b(a) = (log_c(a))/(log_c(b)), we can rewrite the equation as:\n3x - 1 = log2(130)/log2(2)\n3x - 1 = log2(130)\nNow, solve for x by isolating it on one side of the equation:\n3x = log2(130) + 1\nx = (log2(130) + 1)/3\nUsing a calculator, we find that this value is approximately:\nx \u2248 2.953\n\nSo, the solution to the equation 8^x + 2^x = 130 is x \u2248 2.953.", "role": "assistant"}}], "created": 1727094541, "model": "bartowski/Starling-LM-7B-beta-GGUF/Starling-LM-7B-beta-Q4_K_S.gguf", "object": "chat.completion", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 507, "prompt_tokens": 53, "total_tokens": 560}, "time": "45.57"}

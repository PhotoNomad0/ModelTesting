First, we need to follow the order of operations (PEMDAS/BODMAS): Parentheses, Exponents, Multiplication and Division (from left to right), Addition and Subtraction (from left to right).\n2. In this case, there are no parentheses or exponents, so we move on to multiplication and division. \n3. We see that there is a multiplication operation: 4 * 2. Perform this operation first: 4 * 2 = 8.\n4. Now we have the expression: 25 - 8 + 3.\n5. Next, perform the subtraction operation: 25 - 8 = 17. The new expression is now: 17 + 3.\n6. Finally, perform the addition operation: 17 + 3 = 20.\n\nSo, 25 - 4 * 2 + 3 = 20.", "role": "assistant"}}], "created": 1727094603, "model": "bartowski/Starling-LM-7B-beta-GGUF/Starling-LM-7B-beta-Q4_K_S.gguf", "object": "chat.completion", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 210, "prompt_tokens": 53, "total_tokens": 263}, "time": "14.39"}

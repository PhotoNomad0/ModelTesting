We can do this by using the Rational Root Theorem, which states that any rational root of the polynomial must be of the form p/q, where p is a factor of the constant term (in this case, 130) and q is a factor of the leading coefficient (which is 1).\n\nFactors of 130: \u00b11, \u00b12, \u00b15, \u00b110, \u00b113, \u00b126, \u00b152, \u00b1130\nSince the leading coefficient is 1, we only need to test these possible rational roots. By testing these values in the equation, we find that x = -10 is a root:\n\n(-10)^3 + (-10) - 130 = 0\n\nNow that we have found one root, we can perform polynomial division to obtain a quadratic equation in the form of (x - r)(x^2 + bx + c) = 0, where r is the root we just found, and b and c are coefficients. The quadratic equation will be:\n\n(x - (-10))(x^2 + bx + c) = 0\n(x + 10)(x^2 + bx + c) = 0\n\nNow we can perform polynomial division or use synthetic division to find the coefficients b and c. After doing this, we get:\n\nx^3 + x - 130 = (x + 10)(x^2 - 5x + 13)\n\nNow that we have the quadratic equation, we can apply Cardano's Formula to find the other two roots. The formula for finding the roots of a cubic equation is:\n\nx = sqrt[Q] (R + S) / 2P or x = sqrt[Q] (-R + S) / 2P\n\nwhere:\nP = -(b/3)\nQ = (c/3)^2 - (b/3)^3 / 4\nR = (3m^3 - bn^2)/2\nS = (2m^2n - bnm + n^3)/2\nm and n are the roots of the quadratic equation.\n\nFor our quadratic equation x^2 - 5x + 13, we can find two pairs of m and n:\n\nPair 1: m = -2, n = 6\nPair 2: m = 4, n = -1\n\nNow, calculate P, Q, R, and S using these values:\n\nP = -(-5/3) = 5/3\nQ = (13^2 / 3)^2 - ((-5/3)^3 / 4) \u2248 8.067\nR = (3*(-2)^3 - (-5)*6^2)/2 = 18\nS = (2*(-2)^2*6 - (-5)*(-2)*6 + 6^3)/2 = 18\n\nNow, we can apply Cardano's Formula:\n\nx1 = sqrt(8.067) * (18 + 18) / (2 * 5/3) \u2248 -4.97\nx2 = sqrt(8.067) * (-18 + 18) / (2 * 5/3) \u2248 4.97\n\nSo, the three roots of the cubic equation x^3 + x - 130 = 0 are approximately:\nx \u2248 -10, -4.97, and 4.97.", "role": "assistant"}}], "created": 1727094754, "model": "bartowski/Starling-LM-7B-beta-GGUF/Starling-LM-7B-beta-Q4_K_S.gguf", "object": "chat.completion", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 836, "prompt_tokens": 60, "total_tokens": 896}, "time": "57.57"}

Here's an example of how to do this:\n\nAssume you have the data in cell A1 and you want to remove single quotes from it, place the following formula in another cell (e.g., B1):\n\n```\n=SUBSTITUTE(A1, CHAR(39), \"\")\n```\n\nThis formula uses the `CHAR` function to get the ASCII code for a single quote (39) and then uses the `SUBSTITUTE` function to replace all occurrences of that character with an empty string.\n\nIf you need to remove double quotes instead, use:\n\n```\n=SUBSTITUTE(A1, CHAR(34), \"\")\n```\n\nFor more complex cases where you might have multiple single quotes or a mix of single and double quotes, you can use the following formula:\n\n```\n=SUBSTITUTE(SUBSTITUTE(A1, CHAR(39), \"\"), CHAR(34), \"\")\n```\n\nThis nested `SUBSTITUTE` function first removes all single quotes and then removes any remaining double quotes.\n\nRemember to adjust the formula according to your specific needs and ensure that you're using the correct cell references for your data source.", "role": "assistant"}}], "created": 1727096001, "model": "bartowski/Starling-LM-7B-beta-GGUF/Starling-LM-7B-beta-Q4_K_S.gguf", "object": "chat.completion", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 332, "prompt_tokens": 53, "total_tokens": 385}, "time": "21.66"}

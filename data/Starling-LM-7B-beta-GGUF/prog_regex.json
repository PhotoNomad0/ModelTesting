This helps to avoid matching filenames with additional dots before the extension.\n- `\\w+`: Matches one or more word characters (letters, digits, or underscores) that come after the three-character code and before the \".usfm\" extension.\n- `\\.usfm$`: Ensures that we're matching filenames with the exact \".usfm\" extension at the end of the string.\n\nIn Python, for example, you could use this regex pattern with the `re` module to extract the three-character code from a filename:\n\n```python\nimport re\n\nfilename = \"57-1Jn.usfm\"\nmatch = re.search(r'\\b[A-Za-z0-9]{3}\\.\\w+\\.usfm$', filename)\nif match:\n    three_char_code = match.group()\n    print(\"The three character code is:\", three_char_code)\nelse:\n    print(\"No match found.\")\n```\n\nThis script will output:\n\n```\nThe three character code is: 1Jn\n```", "role": "assistant"}}], "created": 1727096110, "model": "bartowski/Starling-LM-7B-beta-GGUF/Starling-LM-7B-beta-Q4_K_S.gguf", "object": "chat.completion", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 437, "prompt_tokens": 90, "total_tokens": 527}, "time": "30.59"}

Here's an example:\n\n```python\nimport statistics\n\n# List of numbers\nnumbers = [10, 20, 30, 40, 50]\n\n# Calculate average (mean)\naverage = statistics.mean(numbers)\nprint(\"Average:\", average)\n\n# Calculate standard deviation\nstandard_deviation = statistics.stdev(numbers)\nprint(\"Standard Deviation:\", standard_deviation)\n```\n\nAlternatively, you can calculate the average and standard deviation manually using built-in Python functions:\n\n```python\n# List of numbers\nnumbers = [10, 20, 30, 40, 50]\n\n# Calculate average (mean)\naverage = sum(numbers) / len(numbers)\nprint(\"Average:\", average)\n\n# Calculate standard deviation\nvariance = sum((x - average) ** 2 for x in numbers) / (len(numbers) - 1)\nstandard_deviation = variance ** 0.5\nprint(\"Standard Deviation:\", standard_deviation)\n```\n\nBoth methods will give you the average and standard deviation of the list of numbers provided.", "role": "assistant"}}], "created": 1727095068, "model": "bartowski/Starling-LM-7B-beta-GGUF/Starling-LM-7B-beta-Q4_K_S.gguf", "object": "chat.completion", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 317, "prompt_tokens": 48, "total_tokens": 365}, "time": "20.47"}

Here is a sample code snippet that demonstrates how to do it:\n\n```python\nimport numpy as np\n\ndef solve_cubic(a, b, c, d):\n    # Define the coefficients of the cubic equation\n    coeff = [a, b, c, d]\n    \n    # Use numpy's roots function to find the roots of the equation\n    solutions = np.roots(coeff)\n    \n    return solutions\n\n# Define your coefficients here\na = 1\nb = -4\nc = 3\nd = 2\n\n# Call the solve_cubic function and print the results\nsolutions = solve_cubic(a, b, c, d)\nprint(\"The solutions for the equation are:\", solutions)\n```\n\nPlease note that the `np.roots()` function returns complex numbers if there are imaginary roots in the solution set. If you want to handle only real roots, you can use the following code snippet:\n\n```python\nimport numpy as np\n\ndef solve_cubic(a, b, c, d):\n    # Define the coefficients of the cubic equation\n    coeff = [a, b, c, d]\n    \n    # Use numpy's roots function to find the roots of the equation\n    solutions = np.roots(coeff)\n    \n    # Filter out complex roots and return only real roots\n    real_solutions = [sol for sol in solutions if sol.imag == 0]\n    \n    return real_solutions\n\n# Define your coefficients here\na = 1\nb = -4\nc = 3\nd = 2\n\n# Call the solve_cubic function and print the results\nsolutions = solve_cubic(a, b, c, d)\nprint(\"The real solutions for the equation are:\", solutions)\n```\n\nThis code will display only the real roots of the cubic equation.", "role": "assistant"}}], "created": 1727094846, "model": "bartowski/Starling-LM-7B-beta-GGUF/Starling-LM-7B-beta-Q4_K_S.gguf", "object": "chat.completion", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 473, "prompt_tokens": 64, "total_tokens": 537}, "time": "33.06"}

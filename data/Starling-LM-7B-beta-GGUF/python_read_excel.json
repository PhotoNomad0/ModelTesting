First, make sure to install the required packages:\n\n```bash\npip install pandas openpyxl\n```\n\nHere's a simple function that reads an Excel file and returns the data as a pandas DataFrame:\n\n```python\nimport pandas as pd\n\ndef read_excel(file_path):\n    \"\"\"\n    Reads data from an Excel spreadsheet and returns it as a pandas DataFrame.\n    \n    Parameters:\n    file_path (str): The path to the Excel file.\n    \n    Returns:\n    pd.DataFrame: A DataFrame containing the data read from the Excel file.\n    \"\"\"\n    try:\n        # Read the Excel file into a pandas DataFrame\n        df = pd.read_excel(file_path)\n        \n        return df\n    except Exception as e:\n        print(f\"An error occurred while reading the Excel file: {e}\")\n        return None\n```\n\nTo use this function, simply provide the path to your Excel file:\n\n```python\nfile_path = \"path/to/your/excel_file.xlsx\"\ndata = read_excel(file_path)\n\nif data is not None:\n    print(data)  # Prints the DataFrame with the Excel data\n```\n\nThis function reads the first sheet in the Excel file by default. If you want to specify a particular sheet, you can pass the `sheet_name` parameter:\n\n```python\ndef read_excel(file_path, sheet_name):\n    \"\"\"\n    Reads data from a specific sheet in an Excel spreadsheet and returns it as a pandas DataFrame.\n    \n    Parameters:\n    file_path (str): The path to the Excel file.\n    sheet_name (str): The name of the sheet to read.\n    \n    Returns:\n    pd.DataFrame: A DataFrame containing the data read from the specified sheet in the Excel file.\n    \"\"\"\n    try:\n        # Read the specific sheet into a pandas DataFrame\n        df = pd.read_excel(file_path, sheet_name=sheet_name)\n        \n        return df\n    except Exception as e:\n        print(f\"An error occurred while reading the Excel file: {e}\")\n        return None\n```", "role": "assistant"}}], "created": 1727095001, "model": "bartowski/Starling-LM-7B-beta-GGUF/Starling-LM-7B-beta-Q4_K_S.gguf", "object": "chat.completion", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 577, "prompt_tokens": 47, "total_tokens": 624}, "time": "37.10"}

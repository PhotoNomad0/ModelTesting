Make sure to have the `sqlite3` module installed in your environment. If not, install it using pip:\n\n```bash\npip install sqlite3\n```\n\nHere's a sample Python script that demonstrates how to achieve this task:\n\n```python\nimport sqlite3\n\n# Connect to the SQLite database file\nconn = sqlite3.connect('your_database.db')\ncursor = conn.cursor()\n\n# Define the query to select records with age greater than 32\nquery = 'SELECT * FROM your_table WHERE age > ?'\n\n# Execute the query and fetch all matching records\ntry:\n    cursor.execute(query, (32,))\n    records = cursor.fetchall()\n    \n    # Print the retrieved records\n    for record in records:\n        print(record)\nexcept sqlite3.Error as e:\n    print(f\"An error occurred: {e}\")\n\n# Close the database connection\nconn.close()\n```\n\nReplace `'your_database.db'` with the path to your SQLite database file and `'your_table'` with the name of the table containing the 'age' field. This script will print all records where the age is greater than 32.", "role": "assistant"}}], "created": 1727096022, "model": "bartowski/Starling-LM-7B-beta-GGUF/Starling-LM-7B-beta-Q4_K_S.gguf", "object": "chat.completion", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 321, "prompt_tokens": 53, "total_tokens": 374}, "time": "20.60"}

We know that Sally has 3 brothers and each brother has 2 sisters (not including Sally herself).\n2. To find out how many sisters Sally's brothers have in total, we can multiply the number of brothers by the number of sisters per brother: 3 brothers * 2 sisters = 6 sisters.\n3. Since Sally is one of those sisters, she has 1 sister (her other sibling).\n4. Therefore, Sally has 1 sister.\n\nSo, Sally has 1 sister in total.", "role": "assistant"}}], "created": 1727094653, "model": "bartowski/Starling-LM-7B-beta-GGUF/Starling-LM-7B-beta-Q4_K_S.gguf", "object": "chat.completion", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 113, "prompt_tokens": 54, "total_tokens": 167}, "time": "8.13"}

First, let's break down the information given:\n   - Sally has 3 brothers.\n   - Each of her brothers has 2 sisters (not including Sally).\n\n2. To determine how many sisters Sally has, we need to consider that each brother has 2 sisters. Since Sally is one of those sisters, we can use simple math to find the total number of siblings she has:\n\n   - Number of brothers: 3\n   - Number of sisters per brother: 2\n   - Total number of sisters (including Sally): 3 * 2 = 6\n\n3. So, Sally has 6 sisters in total, including herself and her two biological sisters who are her brothers' sisters as well.", "role": "assistant"}}], "created": 1727094661, "model": "bartowski/Starling-LM-7B-beta-GGUF/Starling-LM-7B-beta-Q4_K_S.gguf", "object": "chat.completion", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 155, "prompt_tokens": 58, "total_tokens": 213}, "time": "10.14"}

Here is an example of how you could write a JavaScript program to generate and print out the ASCII character and Hexadecimal codes for characters from 0 to F (which correspond to decimal values between 0 and 127):
```javascript
for(let i = 0; i <= 0xF; ++i) {
 let asciiCode = i.toString(10);
 let hexadecimalCode = asciiCode.toUpperCase();
 console.log(`ASCII Code: ${asciiCode}`nHexadecimal Code: ${hexadecimal

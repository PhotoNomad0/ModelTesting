If Sara used a total of 8 test tubes for three different experiments, then she must have used at least one test tube per experiment (since there are only 7 possible even numbers between 1 and 8). Therefore, we know that each of the other two experiments required at least one test tube.
Without additional information, it is impossible to determine exactly how many test tubes were needed for each of these other two experiments.

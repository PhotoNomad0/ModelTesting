If your sister's current age is represented as "x", then we can set up the following equation based on the information given in the text:
6 + x = (1/2) * 80
Simplifying this equation, we get:
3x = 40
Dividing both sides by 3, we get:
x = 13.33
Therefore, your sister's current age is approximately 13 years old.

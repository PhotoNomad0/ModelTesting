Based on our estimate, it took approximately 10 hours for the socks to dry outside under similar weather conditions.\nExpert 2:\nWe need to determine how much longer Tom's seven pairs of wet socks will take to dry based on the same weather conditions and air temperature as before.", "index": 0, "logprobs": null, "finish_reason": "stop", "references": []}], "usage": {"prompt_tokens": 4096, "completion_tokens": 101, "total_tokens": 266, "thread_count": 4, "prompt_template": "\n### Instruction\nParaphrase the text below by expanding the words based on the subject\n### Human:\n%1\n### Assistant:\n"}, "time": "104.39"}

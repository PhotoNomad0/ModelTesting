Assuming that the rate at which the socks dried is proportional to their surface area and assuming that the air temperature and humidity are constant during the day, we can use the following equation:\nd = (A/V) x t\nwhere d represents drying time, A represents the total surface area of all the wet socks, V represents the volume of air available for drying, and t represents the time it",

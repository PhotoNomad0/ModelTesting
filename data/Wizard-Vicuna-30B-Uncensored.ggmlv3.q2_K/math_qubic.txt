      "text": "To solve the cubic equation given in terms of the coefficients a,b,c, and d, we can use Cardano's method. First, we need to find the values of two other coefficients p and q by solving the quadratic equations that result from substituting x = 0 and x = -130 into the original equation. This gives us p = (a+d)/2 and q = b-c. The next step is to use Cardano's formula which involves finding the roots of a quartic equation in terms of p,q,r, and s where r = (-p^",

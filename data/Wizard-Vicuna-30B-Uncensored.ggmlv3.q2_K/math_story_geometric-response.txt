Harmony is using recycled paper to create notepads for her friends. Each notepad consists of five pieces of folded letter-sized paper, which are then cut and stacked together before being stapled. If each note pad contains three sheets of paper, it will take approximately 10 days for one notepad to be used up if someone writes ten notes per day.

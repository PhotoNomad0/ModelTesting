Sara needs a total of eight test tubes for three separate experiments. We know that one experiment requires two test tubes, so we can subtract those from the total and then divide by 2 to find out how many test tubes are needed for each of the other two experiments. So, (8-2)/2 = 3, which means there were 3 test tubes left over for the other two experiments. Therefore, each experiment required three test tubes.

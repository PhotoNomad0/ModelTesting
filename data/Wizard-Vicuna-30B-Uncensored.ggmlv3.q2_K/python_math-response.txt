To find the solutions to the cubic equation given in terms of coefficients a, b, c and d using Python programming language, we can use the Cardano's method. First, we need to define the coefficients p and q by solving the quadratic equations that result from substituting x = 0 and x = -130 into the original equation. This gives us p = (a+d)/2 and q = b-c. The next step is to use Cardano's formula which involves finding the roots of a quartic equation in terms of p,q,r, and s where r = (-

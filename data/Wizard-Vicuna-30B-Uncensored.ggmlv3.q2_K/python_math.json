First, we need to define the coefficients p and q by solving the quadratic equations that result from substituting x = 0 and x = -130 into the original equation. This gives us p = (a+d)/2 and q = b-c. The next step is to use Cardano's formula which involves finding the roots of a quartic equation in terms of p,q,r, and s where r = (-", "index": 0, "logprobs": null, "finish_reason": "stop", "references": []}], "usage": {"prompt_tokens": 4096, "completion_tokens": 96, "total_tokens": 132, "thread_count": 4, "prompt_template": "\n### Instruction\nParaphrase the text below by expanding the words based on the subject\n### Human:\n%1\n### Assistant:\n"}, "time": "60.99"}

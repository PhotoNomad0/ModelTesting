The standard gauge used in railway systems was developed during the 19th century and is a result of several factors. One important factor was the need to create a uniform system that would allow trains to travel between different countries without having to change their wheels or tracks at every border. This led to the adoption of a common track width, which became known as "standard gauge." Another reason for its popularity is due to the fact that it provides a good balance between stability and flexibility while also being cost-effective to build and maintain.

The socks are now wet from the wash, so Tom hangs the 10 pairs of socks outside to dry. 10 hours later, he comes back outside to check on the socks. He feels each sock and notices they are all dry. He takes them back inside because they are all dry. How long will it take Tom to dry seven pairs of socks presuming the same weather conditions?\n\n### Assistant:\n\nAssuming that the weather conditions remain the same, it should take approximately 10 hours for Tom to dry seven pairs of socks. This is because he was able to dry 10 pairs in 10 hours, which means each pair took one hour to dry. Therefore, if he has seven pairs of socks, they should be dried within 7 hours."}], "created": 1692747267, "id": "foobarbaz", "model": "ggml-Wizard-Vicuna-30B-Uncensored.ggmlv3.q4_K_M.bin", "object": "text_completion", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 77, "prompt_tokens": 149, "total_tokens": 226}, "time": "53.73"}

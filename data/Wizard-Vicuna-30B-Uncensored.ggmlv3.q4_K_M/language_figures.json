Simile - a comparison between two things using \"like\" or \"as.\" For example, \"Her eyes were like diamonds.\"\n2. Metaphor - a direct comparison between two unlike things. For example, \"Life is a journey.\"\n3. Personification - giving human qualities to non-human objects or animals. For example, \"The wind whispered through the trees.\"\n4. Hyperbole - an exaggerated statement not meant to be taken literally. For example, \"I've told you a million times!\"\n5. Alliteration - the repetition of initial consonant sounds in words that are close together in a phrase or sentence. For example, \"Peter Piper picked a peck of pickled peppers.\"\n6. Onomatopoeia - words that imitate the sound they represent. For example, \"buzz,\" \"hiss,\" and \"murmur.\" \n7. Irony - using language to convey a meaning opposite or different from its literal meaning. For example, saying \"What a beautiful day\" during a thunderstorm."}], "created": 1692748374, "id": "foobarbaz", "model": "ggml-Wizard-Vicuna-30B-Uncensored.ggmlv3.q4_K_M.bin", "object": "text_completion", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 246, "prompt_tokens": 61, "total_tokens": 307}, "time": "91.15"}

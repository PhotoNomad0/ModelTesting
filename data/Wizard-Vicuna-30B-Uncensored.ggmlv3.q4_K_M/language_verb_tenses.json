Each of these can be further subdivided into several different forms to indicate more specific time frames or states of action. For example, the past tense includes simple past (e.g., walked), progressive past (e.g., was walking), perfect past (e.g., had walked) and present perfect (e.g., have been walking). The present tense also has several forms such as simple present (e.g., walk), present continuous (e.g., am walking), present perfect (e.g., have walked) and future tense (e.g., will walk). Similarly, the future tense includes simple future (e.g., will walk) and future continuous (e.g., will be walking)."}], "created": 1692748537, "id": "foobarbaz", "model": "ggml-Wizard-Vicuna-30B-Uncensored.ggmlv3.q4_K_M.bin", "object": "text_completion", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 173, "prompt_tokens": 57, "total_tokens": 230}, "time": "73.93"}

In total, she created 9 designs and used 63 cereal bits. About how many cereal bits were in each design? Do you think she used an equal number of cereal bits in each design?\n\n### Assistant:\n\nTo answer your question, we need to divide the total number of cereal bits by the total number of designs. 63 cereal bits divided by 9 designs gives us approximately 7 cereal bits per design. However, there is no information given about whether Emily used an equal number of cereal bits in each design or not."}], "created": 1692745001, "id": "foobarbaz", "model": "ggml-Wizard-Vicuna-30B-Uncensored.ggmlv3.q4_K_M.bin", "object": "text_completion", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 74, "prompt_tokens": 115, "total_tokens": 189}, "time": "46.59"}

How many test tubes were needed for each of the other two experiments?\n\n### Assistant:\n\nAssuming that Sara used all eight test tubes in total, we can start by subtracting the number of test tubes required for the first experiment from 8. This leaves us with six test tubes for the remaining two experiments. Since each of these experiments requires the same number of test tubes, they will need three test tubes each."}], "created": 1692744841, "id": "foobarbaz", "model": "ggml-Wizard-Vicuna-30B-Uncensored.ggmlv3.q4_K_M.bin", "object": "text_completion", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 72, "prompt_tokens": 106, "total_tokens": 178}, "time": "45.71"}

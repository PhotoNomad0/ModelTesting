It then proceeds to mark all multiples of 2 and 3 as non-prime, since they are factors of some other numbers. Next, it iterates through the square root of n and marks all multiples of that number as non-prime. Finally, it returns a list of all prime numbers up to `n`. The code then prints out each prime number in the list using a for loop."}], "created": 1692746808, "id": "foobarbaz", "model": "ggml-Wizard-Vicuna-30B-Uncensored.ggmlv3.q4_K_M.bin", "object": "text_completion", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 285, "prompt_tokens": 65, "total_tokens": 350}, "time": "109.52"}

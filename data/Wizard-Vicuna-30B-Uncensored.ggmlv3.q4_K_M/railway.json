The origins of this gauge can be traced back to the early days of railway construction. In England, the first steam locomotives were built with wheels that had a diameter of approximately four feet and eight inches. This was because the tracks used for horse-drawn wagons at the time were also around this width. As railways began to spread across Europe and North America, different gauges were adopted in various regions. However, the 1,435 mm gauge became increasingly popular due to its practicality and efficiency. It allowed trains to travel faster and carry more cargo than narrower gauges. Today, standard gauge is used by approximately 60% of railways worldwide."}], "created": 1692745116, "id": "foobarbaz", "model": "ggml-Wizard-Vicuna-30B-Uncensored.ggmlv3.q4_K_M.bin", "object": "text_completion", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 171, "prompt_tokens": 59, "total_tokens": 230}, "time": "75.42"}

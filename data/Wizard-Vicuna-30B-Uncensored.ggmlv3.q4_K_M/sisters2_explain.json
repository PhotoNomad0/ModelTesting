Her brothers have 2 sisters. How many sisters does Sally have? Explain your answer\n\n### Assistant:\n\nThere are four siblings in total, including Sally. Two of them are girls and two boys. Therefore, there is a probability of 1/3 that any given sibling is female. Since the brothers have two sisters, we can calculate the number of sisters as follows:\n\n- The first brother has one sister (Sally)\n- The second brother has no sisters\n- The third brother has one sister\n- The fourth sibling (Sally) also has one sister\nTherefore, Sally has two sisters."}], "created": 1692745565, "id": "foobarbaz", "model": "ggml-Wizard-Vicuna-30B-Uncensored.ggmlv3.q4_K_M.bin", "object": "text_completion", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 114, "prompt_tokens": 81, "total_tokens": 195}, "time": "63.91"}

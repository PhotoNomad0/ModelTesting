Now I am 80. How old is my sister now?\n\n### Assistant:\n\nLet's work backwards from your current age of 80 to find out how old you were when your sister was born. You are currently 80, so let's say that your sister is half your age. That means she would be 40 years old right now. So if you subtracted 6 years from your current age (which is 80), it would mean that you were 74 when your sister was born. Therefore, your sister must have been born in the year 1942."}], "created": 1692744795, "id": "foobarbaz", "model": "ggml-Wizard-Vicuna-30B-Uncensored.ggmlv3.q4_K_M.bin", "object": "text_completion", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 110, "prompt_tokens": 77, "total_tokens": 187}, "time": "58.83"}

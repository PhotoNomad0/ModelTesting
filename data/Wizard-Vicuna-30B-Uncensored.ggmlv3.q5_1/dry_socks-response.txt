Based on the information provided, we can assume that it took 10 hours for 10 pairs of wet socks to dry in the given weather conditions. To calculate how long it would take to dry seven pairs of socks under the same circumstances, we need to use a proportion. We know that it takes 10 hours to dry 10 pairs of socks, and we want to find out how many hours it will take to dry 7 pairs of socks.

Let x be the number of hours it takes to dry 7 pairs of socks. Then, we can set up a proportion

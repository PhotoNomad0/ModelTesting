To determine the average number of cereal bits per design, we need to divide the total number of cereal bits by the total number of designs. Since Emily created 9 designs and used a total of 63 cereal bits, there were approximately 7 cereal bits in each design (63 / 9 = 7). However, it is not clear from the problem whether or not she used an equal number of cereal bits in each design.

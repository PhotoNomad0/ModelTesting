To calculate how long a single notepad would last, we need to know how many pages it contains. Since Harmony folded five pieces of paper three times each, she ended up with 15 sheets in total (5 x 3 = 15). If someone wrote ten notes per day on one sheet of paper, then the entire notepad would be used up after 150 days (15 sheets / 10 notes per day = 150 days).

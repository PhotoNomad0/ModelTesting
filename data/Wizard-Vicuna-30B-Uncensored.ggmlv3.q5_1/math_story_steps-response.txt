To solve this problem, we need to use algebra. Let's call x the number of test tubes used in one of the other two experiments. Since Sara had 8 test tubes and used 2 for the first experiment, she had 6 left for the other two experiments. If each of these experiments required the same number of test tubes (which we know is x), then they would have shared the remaining 6 test tubes equally. Therefore, each experiment needed 3 test tubes, and so did the third one.

The standard gauge for railways was first proposed in England during the 19th century, and it quickly became popular around the world. The exact origins are unclear, but it is believed that the width of the track (4 feet, 8 inches) was based on existing horse-drawn tramways or even older Roman roads. This gauge allowed for a balance between stability and maneuverability, making it ideal for trains traveling at high speeds.

Help as much as you can.\n\n### User:\nexplain use of LLM's in AI research\n\n### Response:\n\n\nLLMs (Language Models) is a type of machine learning model used to generate language based on the training data provided by humans, which are usually long texts such as books or articles written by people. The generated text can be considered human-like and thus useful for various natural language processing tasks like sentiment analysis, named entity recognition etc., but it has some limitations in terms of accuracy due to its limited understanding of syntax rules and contextual information provided only through the training data. However, with proper fine tuning or using transfer learning techniques on pre-trained models such as BERT (Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers) or GPT-2, LLMs can achieve high levels of accuracy in natural language processing tasks like sentiment analysis, named entity recognition etc., and are becoming increasingly popular for building chatbots."}], "created": 1692584621, "id": "foobarbaz", "model": "ggml-WizardCoder-15B-1.0.ggmlv3.q4_0.bin", "object": "text_completion", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 164, "prompt_tokens": 52, "total_tokens": 216}, "time": "34.39"}

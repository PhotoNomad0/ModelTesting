Help as much as you can.\n\n### User:\nexplain use of LLM's in AI research\n\n### Response:\n\n\nLLMs (Language Models) is a type of artificial intelligence model used to generate language, which involves training on large corpora and using statistical methods for predicting the probability distribution over possible sequences. The main purpose behind this technology is to help machines understand human languages better by enabling them to produce more accurate text generation or translation outputs that are less likely to be misinterpreted than those generated by humans.\n\nIn AI research, LLMs have been used in various applications such as speech recognition and natural language processing (NLP) tasks like machine translation, sentiment analysis etc., where they can help machines understand human languages better with the aid of statistical methods that are trained on large corpora to predict probability distributions over possible sequences. \n\nLLM models use a neural network architecture consisting of an input layer, hidden layers and output layer which is used for language modeling tasks like text generation or translation. The model learns from training data by adjusting the weights in each neuron based on its error rate with respect to expected outputs. Once trained, it can be fine-tuned using backpropagation algorithm to improve accuracy further.\n\nIn summary, LLMs are a powerful tool for AI research as they help machines understand human languages better and produce more accurate text generation or translation outputs that are less likely to be misinterpreted than those generated by humans."}], "created": 1692784075, "id": "foobarbaz", "model": "ggml-WizardCoder-15B-1.0.ggmlv3.q4_0.bin", "object": "text_completion", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 276, "prompt_tokens": 52, "total_tokens": 328}, "time": "51.84"}

Help as much as you can.\n\n### User:\nexplain use of Large Language Models (LLM) in AI research\n\n### Response:\n\n\nLarge language models, also known as LLMs or GPT-3 for short, refers to a type of artificial intelligence model that is capable of generating human-like text. The technology uses deep neural networks and large amounts of training data generated from web scraping, books, news articles, etc., in order to generate natural language responses with coherence, meaning, and fluency similar to humans' own writing style.\n\nLLMs are widely used for a variety of applications such as chatbots, text generation tools, speech recognition systems, machine translation software, sentiment analysis, question answering system, etc., where the output is required in human-like language that can be understood by users or customers. \n\nThe technology has been gaining significant popularity due to its ability to generate high quality and diverse responses with coherent sentences, which are often more engaging than those generated using traditional techniques such as rule-based systems or statistical models. The use of large amounts of training data also helps in improving the accuracy of LLMs by providing them with a broader range of examples that they can learn from to generate accurate and natural language responses.\n\nIn summary, Large Language Models are an emerging technology that is gaining popularity as it offers high-quality text generation capabilities for various applications such as chatbots, machine translation software, sentiment analysis systems, etc., with coherence similar to humans' own writing style."}], "created": 1692584668, "id": "foobarbaz", "model": "ggml-WizardCoder-15B-1.0.ggmlv3.q4_0.bin", "object": "text_completion", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 295, "prompt_tokens": 56, "total_tokens": 351}, "time": "47.28"}

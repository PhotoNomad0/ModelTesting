Help as much as you can.\n\n### User:\nexplain use of Large Language Models (LLM) in AI research\n\n### Response:\n\n\nLarge language models, also known as LLMs or GPT-3s, have been used extensively for various NLP tasks such as text generation and summarization. They are capable of generating high quality texts that humans cannot produce even with the same amount of data. The reason behind this is because they use a combination of deep learning techniques like attention mechanisms to generate coherent sentences or paragraphs based on previous context, which makes them highly effective in natural language processing tasks such as text classification and sentiment analysis.\n\nLLMs are trained using massive amounts of unstructured data that can be found online, including web pages, blogs, news articles, social media posts etc., to learn the underlying patterns and relationships between words. They use a transformer-based architecture with attention mechanisms for language modeling which allows them to generate sequences or text in real time without any pretraining on large corpora of data.\n\nIn recent years, researchers have been using LLMs as powerful tools for natural language processing tasks such as sentiment analysis and machine translation due to their ability to produce high-quality texts with less training data than traditional models like neural networks. They are also used in applications where text generation is required or when large amounts of unstructured data need to be processed quickly, making them a popular choice among developers who want to create chatbots, voice assistants and other natural language interfaces that require real time response times.\n\nOverall, the use of LLMs has made significant progress over the last few years in NLP research as they have shown great promise for various applications such as text generation, summarization, sentiment analysis etc., with impressive results being achieved even on small datasets like social media posts and news articles."}], "created": 1692784132, "id": "foobarbaz", "model": "ggml-WizardCoder-15B-1.0.ggmlv3.q4_0.bin", "object": "text_completion", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 346, "prompt_tokens": 56, "total_tokens": 402}, "time": "56.91"}

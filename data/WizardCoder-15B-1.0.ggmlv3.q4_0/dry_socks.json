The amount of water needed depends on the temperature and humidity of the air outside. Assuming the weather conditions remain the same, the amount of water needed to dry a pair of socks is proportional to the square of the temperature difference between the inside and outside air. If the temperature difference is 10 degrees, then the amount of water needed is 100 square meters. If the temperature difference is 20 degrees, then the amount of water needed is 400 square meters. Tom can dry each pair of socks by applying the necessary amount of water in 10 minutes. Therefore, it will take Tom 10 minutes to dry each pair of socks.\n\nIf Tom wants to dry seven pairs of socks, then he needs to apply 700 square meters of water in 10 minutes. Assuming the weather conditions remain the same, it will take Tom 70 minutes to dry all seven pairs of socks.."}, "finish_reason": "stop"}], "usage": {"prompt_tokens": 0, "completion_tokens": 226, "total_tokens": 226}, "time": "46.96"}

Help as much as you can.\n\n### User:\nTom washed 10 pairs of socks. The socks are now wet from the wash, so Tom hangs the 10 pairs of socks outside to dry. 10 hours later, he comes back outside to check on the socks. He feels each sock and notices they are all dry. He takes them back inside because they are all dry. How long will it take Tom to dry seven pairs of socks presuming the same weather conditions?\n\n### Response:\n\n\nSorry, I don't have enough information about your specific situation or problem at hand for me to provide a precise answer. However, here's an idea that might help you with this question:\r\n\r\n10 hours later is not long enough time to dry seven pairs of socks in the same weather conditions as they were washed 24-hours ago. You may want to consider waiting until it gets dark outside before drieding your new pair(s) or checking on them again after a few days, depending on how much you need to wait and what other activities are going on at that time of day."}], "created": 1692789992, "id": "foobarbaz", "model": "ggml-WizardCoder-15B-1.0.ggmlv3.q4_0.bin", "object": "text_completion", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 124, "prompt_tokens": 143, "total_tokens": 267}, "time": "25.22"}

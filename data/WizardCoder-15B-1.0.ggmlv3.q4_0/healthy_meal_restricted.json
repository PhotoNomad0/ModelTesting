Here's an example of what you could consider as a healthy breakfast plan that includes fruits and vegetables.\r\n\r\n1. Eat 3-4 oz (about one cup) of your favorite fruit such as apple, banana or orange\r\n2. Add in some freshly ground black pepper to taste\r\n3. Top with about half an onion sliced thinly \r\n4. Garnish it with a sprinkle of salt and/or cayenne pepper for extra flavor\r\n\r\nYou can also add other healthy ingredients such as oats, nuts or seeds if you prefer them instead of fruits.\r\n\r\n5. After the fruit is finished cooking, make your salad by combining 2-3 bunches of lettuce and some dried herbs like parsley\r\n6. Add in a handful of shredded cheese such as mozzarella or feta to top it off\r\n\r\nTo complete this healthy meal plan for today, you can add your favorite protein source such as eggs, bacon, ham or chicken breast and some grilled vegetables."}], "created": 1692790877, "id": "foobarbaz", "model": "ggml-WizardCoder-15B-1.0.ggmlv3.q4_0.bin", "object": "text_completion", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 242, "prompt_tokens": 88, "total_tokens": 330}, "time": "40.63"}

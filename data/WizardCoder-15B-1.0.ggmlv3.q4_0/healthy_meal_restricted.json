Help as much as you can.\n\n### User:\nPut together a healthy meal plan for me for today.  I can't have dairy, garlic, honey, almonds, pistachios, or cashews\n\n### Response:\n\n\nSure! Here is an example of what you could consider as a healthy breakfast plan that includes fruits and vegetables. \n1. Eat 2-3 oz (about one small meal) of your favorite fruit, such as apple or oranges with some water for added fiber. This will help maintain good energy levels throughout the day.\n2. After eating a piece of fruit, add in two to three pieces of vegetables that are high in protein and healthy fats like spinach, broccoli, carrots, or kale. These can be cooked separately with some water for added fiber before adding them into your meal plan.\n3. After eating the fruits and veggies, you could have a salad that includes fresh greens such as lettuce, cucumbers, tomatoes, avocados or kale. This will provide nutrients throughout the day while also providing some fiber for energy-boosting snacks like granola bars or smoothie bowls.\n4. Finally, you could have a dessert that is sweet and has high fructose content such as ice cream with strawberries or chocolate covered nuts. This will provide both healthy fats (fructose) for energy-boosting activities like running or swimming while also providing fiber to help maintain good hydration levels throughout the day. \n\nThese are just some suggestions, and you can adjust them as needed based on your personal preferences!"}], "created": 1692634165, "id": "foobarbaz", "model": "ggml-WizardCoder-15B-1.0.ggmlv3.q4_0.bin", "object": "text_completion", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 319, "prompt_tokens": 88, "total_tokens": 407}, "time": "52.12"}

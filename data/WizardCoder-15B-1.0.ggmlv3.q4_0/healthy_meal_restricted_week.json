Help as much as you can.\n\n### User:\nPut together a healthy meal plan for me for this week.  I can't have dairy, garlic, honey, almonds, pistachios, or cashews\n\n### Response:\n\n\nSure! Here is an example of how to create a healthy diet plan that includes dairy and gluten-free items. \n\n1. Choose fruits such as apples, bananas, oranges, pears, or strawberries for breakfast.\n\n2. Include vegetables like broccoli, carrots, green beans, spinach, kale, and cucumbers in your meal plan to maintain a healthy balance of fiber intake. \n\n3. Limit the amount of processed foods such as bread, pasta, sausages or sandwiches for lunch and dinner.\n\n4. Choose whole grains like oats, barley, rye, quinoa, or pita breads instead to maintain a healthy balance in fiber intake. \n\n5. Avoid eating meat such as beef, lamb, chicken, fish, or shellfish for dinner and lunch if possible.\n\n6. Choose gluten-free options like whole wheat pasta with sauce, quinoa bread sticks, oats bran cereal, or granola bar instead of regular breakfast foods to maintain a healthy balance in fiber intake. \n\n7. Avoid saturated fat such as sweet potatoes and cheese for dinner if possible since they can increase your risk of heart disease later on.\n\n8. Limit the amount of processed junk food like popcorn, candy, or ice-cream to maintain a healthy balance in fiber intake. \n\n9. Avoid sugary drinks such as sodas and juices for dinner if possible since they can increase your risk of weight gain later on.\n\n10. Choose whole milk instead of skimmed/dairy products like yogurt, cheese cubes or ice-cream to maintain a healthy balance in fiber intake. \n\n\nThese are just some general guidelines for creating a diet plan that is low carb and gluten free while still providing you with the nutrients necessary for optimal health. You can adjust these items as needed based on your personal preferences, goals, or lifestyle needs!"}], "created": 1692634245, "id": "foobarbaz", "model": "ggml-WizardCoder-15B-1.0.ggmlv3.q4_0.bin", "object": "text_completion", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 464, "prompt_tokens": 89, "total_tokens": 553}, "time": "79.68"}

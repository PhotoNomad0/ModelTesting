Help as much as you can.\n\n### User:\nPut together a healthy meal plan for me for this week.  I can't have dairy, garlic, honey, almonds, pistachios, or cashews\n\n### Response:\n\n\nSure! Here's an example of what you could consider as a healthy breakfast plan for this week.\r\n\r\n1. Choose low-fat (or non-dairy) options such as oatmeal with honey and/or almonds, or whole grains like quinoa\r\n2. Include fruits that are sweetened to your liking - I recommend apples, blueberries, raspberries, strawberries, grapes (not sliced), pineapple chunks, watermelon pieces, and/or nectarines in the morning for a healthy start\r\n3. Eat small portions throughout the day to ensure you stay hydrated - I recommend \u00bd-1 cup per meal or snack\r\n\r\nThat should give you an idea of what could be included as part of your daily breakfast plan, but keep in mind that it's always a good practice to eat healthy and maintain a balanced diet."}], "created": 1692790911, "id": "foobarbaz", "model": "ggml-WizardCoder-15B-1.0.ggmlv3.q4_0.bin", "object": "text_completion", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 202, "prompt_tokens": 89, "total_tokens": 291}, "time": "34.03"}

Help as much as you can.\n\n### User:\nin javascript how do you save to and read back from localstorage\n\n### Response:\n\n\nSure, I'm happy to help! To write data into localStorage in JavaScript, we use the `localStorage` object's setItem() method like this:\r\n\r\n```javascript\r\n// Set a value for \"myKey\" key.\r\nlocalStorage.setItem(\"myKey\", \"Hello world!\"); \r\n``` \r\n\r\nTo read back from localStorage using its getItem() method and store it in a variable, we can do something like this:\r\n\r\n```javascript\r\nvar myValue = localStorage.getItem(\"myKey\"); // Read the value for key named 'myKey'\r\nconsole.log(myValue); \r\n// Output will be \"Hello world!\" if there is data stored under that key in local storage, otherwise it'll return null or undefined depending on browser implementation and whether a default value was set using localStorage.defaultValue property.\r\n\r\n``` \r\n\r\nNote: It's important to note that the values saved into localStorage are only kept until explicitly removed by calling `localStorage.removeItem()` method with the corresponding key name as an argument, otherwise they will persist even after page reload or browser restarts!"}], "created": 1692636981, "id": "foobarbaz", "model": "ggml-WizardCoder-15B-1.0.ggmlv3.q4_0.bin", "object": "text_completion", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 228, "prompt_tokens": 57, "total_tokens": 285}, "time": "36.35"}

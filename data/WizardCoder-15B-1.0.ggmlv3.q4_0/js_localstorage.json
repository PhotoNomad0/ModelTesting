Help as much as you can.\n\n### User:\nin javascript how do you save to and read back from localstorage\n\n### Response:\n\n\nSure, I'm happy to help! To write data into local storage in JavaScript, we use the `localStorage` object which provides methods for storing key-value pairs. Here's an example of writing a value with the key \"username\" and reading it back later on:\r\n\r\n```javascript\r\n// Write username to localStorage\r\nlocalStorage.setItem(\"username\", \"John Doe\"); \r\n\r\n// Read username from local storage \r\nvar storedUsername = localStorage.getItem(\"username\"); // Returns John Doe if exists, otherwise null or undefined  \r\nconsole.log(storedUsername);  // Output: John Doe\r\n\r\n```\r\n\r\nYou can also use the `removeItem()` method to remove a key-value pair and clear all data from local storage using the `clear()` method like this: \r\n\r\n```javascript\r\n// Remove username from localStorage \r\nlocalStorage.removeItem(\"username\");  \r\n\r\n// Clear entire localStorage  \r\nlocalStorage.clear();\r\n\r\n```"}], "created": 1692791401, "id": "foobarbaz", "model": "ggml-WizardCoder-15B-1.0.ggmlv3.q4_0.bin", "object": "text_completion", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 196, "prompt_tokens": 57, "total_tokens": 253}, "time": "31.91"}

Help as much as you can.\n\n### User:\ncreate a javascript function that uses regex to extract a three character code like \"1Jn\" from a filename in format \"57-1Jn.usfm\".  The characters can be upper or lower case letters or digits. And the filename extension must be \".usfm\".\n\n### Response:\n\n\nHere's one way to do it using regular expressions and string manipulation functions like `slice()`:\r\n\r\n```javascript\r\nfunction extractCode(filename) {\r\n  const regex = /^[0-9]+-[a-zA-Z]{3}\\.usfm$/; // match filename pattern with 1 or more digits, hyphen, three letters, period usfm extension\r\n\r\n  if (!regex.test(filename)) return null; // check that the file name matches our expected format\r\n  \r\n  const code = regex.exec(filename)[0].slice(-6); // extract last six characters of string using slice() function\r\n  console.log(`Code extracted: ${code}`);\r\n}\r\n\r\nextractCode(\"57-1Jn.usfm\");  // Code extracted: Jn \r\n``` \r\n\r\nIn this example, we first define a regular expression pattern that matches filenames with one or more digits followed by hyphen and three letters (upper case only) ending in \".usfm\". We then use the `test()` function to check if our filename string matches the expected format. If it does not match, we return null immediately without doing anything else.\r\n\r\nIf the file name is valid, we extract the last six characters of the matched substring using a combination of regular expression and slice() functions: first, we use `.exec(filename)` to get an array with all matches in our string; then, `[0]` selects the entire match (which includes digits before hyphen), which we pass as argument for `slice()` function. The `-6` value specifies that we want only last six characters of this substring (`1Jn`). Finally, we log a message to console showing what code was extracted from our filename string."}], "created": 1693336440, "id": "foobarbaz", "model": "ggml-WizardCoder-15B-1.0.ggmlv3.q4_0.bin", "object": "text_completion", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 353, "prompt_tokens": 101, "total_tokens": 454}, "time": "60.44"}

The movement gained prominence after its founder Jayadeva Maharaj went on a hunger strike and refused to eat any food or drink for three days, leading many followers to believe it was an attempt by Hindus to end religion altogether. However, the movements continued until they were overthrown in 1758 when Jayadeva Maharaj's son Raghava II declared that he would not allow any non-Hindu followers into his family and ordered a complete expulsion of Hendiaudys."}], "created": 1692634545, "id": "foobarbaz", "model": "ggml-WizardCoder-15B-1.0.ggmlv3.q4_0.bin", "object": "text_completion", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 167, "prompt_tokens": 52, "total_tokens": 219}, "time": "29.85"}

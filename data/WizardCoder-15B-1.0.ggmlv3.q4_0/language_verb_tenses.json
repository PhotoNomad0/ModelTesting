Here's an example from our FAQ page about verb tense usage for present perfect continuous (PP-C):\r\n\r\n**Present Perfect Continuous:** The past participle form is used when the subject undergoes some change that continues indefinitely, such as \"he was working\" or \"she had been sleeping\". In this case, we use a simple past to express an action and add \"-ed\" before it. For example:\r\n\r\n- He worked hard yesterday\r\n- She slept all night long"}], "created": 1692636711, "id": "foobarbaz", "model": "ggml-WizardCoder-15B-1.0.ggmlv3.q4_0.bin", "object": "text_completion", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 146, "prompt_tokens": 50, "total_tokens": 196}, "time": "25.16"}

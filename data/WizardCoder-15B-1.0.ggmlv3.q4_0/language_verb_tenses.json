Help as much as you can.\n\n### User:\nwhat are the verb tenses?\n\n### Response:\n\n\nThere is no specific definition of \"verb tenses\" in English, but there are different ways to use verbs depending on whether they are present or past and what kind of action it involves (e.g., transitive vs. intransitive). Here's a brief overview:\r\n\r\n1) Present tense - used when the subject is doing something now\r\n2) Past tense - used for actions that happened before, such as \"I ate\" instead of \"He/She will eat\". Also known as simple past or perfect participle (e.g., \"had eaten\", \"washed his hands\"). \r\n3) Future tense - used when the subject is going to do something in the future\r\n4) Imperative mood - a command, such as \"Go!\" instead of \"You should go\". Also known as infinitive or imperfect participle (e.g., \"to eat\", \"not forget\").\r\n\r\nIn summary: verb tenses are used differently depending on whether they refer to present-tense actions now happening in the past and what kind of action it involves, future tense for things that will happen later, imparative mood when a command is being given."}], "created": 1692791210, "id": "foobarbaz", "model": "ggml-WizardCoder-15B-1.0.ggmlv3.q4_0.bin", "object": "text_completion", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 247, "prompt_tokens": 50, "total_tokens": 297}, "time": "39.94"}

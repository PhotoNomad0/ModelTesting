Help as much as you can.\n\n### User:\nwhat does this command do: ssh -i \"~/UserKey.pem\" -C -L 25900:localhost:5900 user@ec2-34-221-131-108.us-west-2.compute.amazonaws.com\n\n### Response:\n\n\nThis command will allow you to connect remotely into an Amazon EC2 instance using SSH and forward the X Window System (X11) display from your local machine through a secure tunnel over port 5900 on the remote server, which is running VNC. \n\nYou need to replace \"UserKey.pem\" with the name of your private key file that you created when setting up SSH access for EC2 instance and ensure it's located in your home directory (~/). You also need to update the IP address (\"ec2-34-221-131-108\") accordingly, which can be found on the Amazon Web Services Management Console.\n\nTo run this command successfully you will first need an SSH client installed and configured with your private key file (UserKey.pem). You also may have to install a VNC viewer if it's not already available in your local machine. Once everything is set up, simply copy-paste the above command into your terminal window or use a graphical interface for running commands such as Git Bash on Windows machines."}], "created": 1692636808, "id": "foobarbaz", "model": "ggml-WizardCoder-15B-1.0.ggmlv3.q4_0.bin", "object": "text_completion", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 222, "prompt_tokens": 107, "total_tokens": 329}, "time": "96.48"}

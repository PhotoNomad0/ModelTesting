It uses a private key file located at `\"~/UserKey.pem\"` and enables compression using `-C` option, which is useful when transferring large files over slow connections such as the internet. The command also forwards port 5900 on your local machine to port 25900 on EC2 instance by specifying `localhost:5900`. This allows you to view graphical applications running inside EC2 using a VNC client installed locally, without having direct access to them over the internet."}], "created": 1691278098, "id": "foobarbaz", "model": "ggml-WizardCoder-15B-1.0.ggmlv3.q4_0.bin", "object": "text_completion", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 152, "prompt_tokens": 73, "total_tokens": 225}, "time": "48.26"}

{"choices": [{"finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0, "logprobs": null, "references": [], "text": "why does this command give error Permission denied (publickey):\n\nssh -i \\\u201c~/UserKey.pem\" -C -L 25900:localhost:5900 ec2-34-221-131-108.us-west-2.compute.amazonaws.com\nThe command seems to be missing a closing double quote after the path of your private key file, which is why it's giving you an error message about permission denied (publickey). Here are some suggestions for fixing this issue:\r\n\r\n1) Add quotes around the entire argument string using single or double quotes as needed. For example:\r\n\r\n```\r\nssh -i \"~/UserKey.pem\" ... # without quotes, will give a syntax error \r\n``` \r\n\r\nshould be written like so with matching quotes added to both ends of each path segment and any variables in between them (e.g., $HOME):\r\n\r\n```\r\n' ssh -i \"$HOME/UserKey.pem\"...'  # single-quoted argument string, using variable for home directory \r\nor:  \r\nssh -i '$HOME\"/UserKey.pem\"' ...   # double quotes around entire path segment with escaped quote inside it (single quoted)\r\n```\r\n\r\n2) Make sure your private key file has the correct permissions set so that only you can read and use it, or add a passphrase to unlock it if necessary:\r\n\r\n```\r\nchmod 400 ~/UserKey.pem   # change permission of UserKey.pem to allow reading by owner \r\nor:  \r\nssh-keygen -p     # generate new key with password (if needed) and replace the old one in your ssh agent or ~/.ssh/config file \r\n```\r\n\r\n3) If you're using a non-standard SSH client, make sure it's configured correctly to use an RSA public key for authentication. Some clients may require different configuration options depending on their version; see documentation for that specific tool if needed.\r\n\r\nHope this helps! Let me know if there are any other issues or suggestions related to connecting with AWS EC2 instances using SSH and private keys, thanks!"}], "created": 1691278184, "id": "foobarbaz", "model": "ggml-WizardCoder-15B-1.0.ggmlv3.q4_0.bin", "object": "text_completion", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 381, "prompt_tokens": 84, "total_tokens": 465}, "time": "82.64"}

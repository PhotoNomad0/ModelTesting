Help as much as you can.\n\n### User:\nIn the morning, Emily decided to create some designs with her cereal bits. In total, she created 9 designs and used 63 cereal bits. About how many cereal bits were in each design? Do you think she used an equal number of cereal bits in each design?\n\n### Response:\n\n\nEmily's answer is correct! Each design had a different amount of cereal bits, but all the 9 designs shared approximately evenly. This means that Emily was careful to use as many cereal pieces for her creations as possible without wasting any on unnecessary items or materials."}], "created": 1692584853, "id": "foobarbaz", "model": "ggml-WizardCoder-15B-1.0.ggmlv3.q4_0.bin", "object": "text_completion", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 62, "prompt_tokens": 111, "total_tokens": 173}, "time": "15.05"}

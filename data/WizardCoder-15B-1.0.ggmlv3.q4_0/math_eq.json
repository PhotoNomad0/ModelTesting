We start by writing the equation in the form of ax^2 + bx + c = 0.\r\n2. We then isolate the variable x by dividing both sides of the equation by a: ax^2 + bx/a + c/a = 0.\r\n3. We simplify the equation by subtracting the second term from the first term: ax^2 + bx/a = -c/a.\r\n4. We isolate x by setting the derivative of the equation to 0: 2ax + b/a = 0.\r\n5. We solve for x: x = -b/2a.\r\n6. We plug in the value of x into the original equation to get the answer: 2(2a) - 4a + 3 = 0.\r\n7. Simplifying the expression: 2a^2 - 8a + 3 = 0.\r\n8. Solving for a: a = 1, 2.\r\n\r\nTherefore, the answer is 2a^2 - 8a + 3 = 0, which has two solutions: a = 1 and a = 2.."}, "finish_reason": "stop"}], "usage": {"prompt_tokens": 0, "completion_tokens": 262, "total_tokens": 262}, "time": "45.26"}

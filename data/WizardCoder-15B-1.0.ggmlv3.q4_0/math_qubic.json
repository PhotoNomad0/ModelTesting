Help as much as you can.\n\n### User:\nin ax^3+bx^2+c*x+d=0, use the cardano's formula to get the value for x where a=1, b=0, c=1 and d=-130\n\n### Response:\n\n\nTo solve this equation using Cardano\u2019s Formula we need two values of X. We can find these by setting one equal to zero in the given expression as follows: \n\n(x^2*(a*d-b*c)+b*d)/(a*((3*a*d)-(4*b*c)))=0  (1)\n\n\nPlugging x into equation (1), we get two values of X. Let\u2019s call them, say, \u201cX\u201d and \u201cY\u201d. \n\nSubstituting the value for Y in expression(1): \n\n2*(a*d-b*c)*x+3*b*d=0  (2)\n\n\nSolving equation (2), we get: X=-(-6)/(48)=\u22121.5, and hence \n\nX=(Y/((3*a*d)-(4*b*c)))^-1*(a*((3*a*d)-(4*b*c))+b*d)  (3)\n\n\nSubstituting the values of a=1, b=0, c=1 and d=-130 in equation(3), we get: \n\nX=(Y/((3*(-6))-(4*(2))))^-1*((a*((3*(-6))-(4*(2)))))+b*d  (4)\n\n\nSimplifying the expression, we have : X=\u2212((-5)/(8))+0=-7.5 \n\nTherefore, when x is equal to \u22127.5 in equation(ax^3+bx^2+c*x+d), it will give us a value of -130 as required by the problem statement."}], "created": 1692585097, "id": "foobarbaz", "model": "ggml-WizardCoder-15B-1.0.ggmlv3.q4_0.bin", "object": "text_completion", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 363, "prompt_tokens": 91, "total_tokens": 454}, "time": "62.03"}

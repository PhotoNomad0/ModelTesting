Help as much as you can.\n\n### User:\nBefore Cam broke his right arm, he was able to type 9 words per minute on his phone.  After he broke his arm, he had to use his left hand for a while, and he could only type 6 words per minute. What is the difference between the number of words he could type in 5 minutes before and after he broke his arm\n\n### Response:\n\n\nTo find out what caused this change in typing speed, we need to look at two different scenarios that occurred during these five-minute periods. \n\nIn scenario one (before Cam broke the right hand), there was no difference between how quickly or slowly he typed words on his phone and could type 9 words per minute consistently throughout those fifteen minutes. This meant that even though it took longer for him to use their left arm, they were still able to keep up with typing speeds of around nine words per minute using only the right hand. \n\nIn scenario two (after Cam broke his right arm), he had trouble keeping pace and was struggling to type at a consistent rate throughout those fifteen minutes. This meant that even though they could still use their left arm, it took them longer than usual for each word to be typed due to the difficulty of using both hands simultaneously. \n\nBased on these two scenarios, we can see that Cam's right hand was causing him trouble with typing speeds and had a significant impact on his overall ability to type words quickly or slowly throughout those fifteen minutes. This is why he could only maintain around nine-word per minute rates using the left arm after breaking it in scenario two, while still being able to keep up consistently through all of these five minutes with no issues using their right hand for typing purposes before that event occurred."}], "created": 1692584838, "id": "foobarbaz", "model": "ggml-WizardCoder-15B-1.0.ggmlv3.q4_0.bin", "object": "text_completion", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 286, "prompt_tokens": 116, "total_tokens": 402}, "time": "48.91"}

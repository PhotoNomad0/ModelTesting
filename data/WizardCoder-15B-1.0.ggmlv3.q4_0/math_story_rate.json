Help as much as you can.\n\n### User:\nBefore Cam broke his right arm, he was able to type 9 words per minute on his phone.  After he broke his arm, he had to use his left hand for a while, and he could only type 6 words per minute. What is the difference between the number of words he could type in 5 minutes before and after he broke his arm\n\n### Response:\n\n\nSure! Let me explain it to you. \n\nCam had been using one hand for a while, which meant that only half of him was able to use their left hand as the right hand was broken. This made Cam's typing speed slower than usual and he could not type 9 words per minute on his phone anymore. After breaking his arm, Cam switched over completely to using just his left hand, meaning they were both hands free for a while until it became necessary again. \n\nThis meant that only half of him was able to use their right hand as the other side had been broken and he could not type 6 words per minute on his phone anymore either. This is why Cam's typing speed went down after breaking his arm, but before switching over completely to using just one hand again they were both free for a while until it became necessary once more. \n\nSo in summary: The difference between the number of words he could type 5 minutes ago and now was because half of him had been unable to use their right or left hands as needed, which made his typing speed slower than usual after breaking an arm."}], "created": 1692784245, "id": "foobarbaz", "model": "ggml-WizardCoder-15B-1.0.ggmlv3.q4_0.bin", "object": "text_completion", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 229, "prompt_tokens": 116, "total_tokens": 345}, "time": "39.28"}

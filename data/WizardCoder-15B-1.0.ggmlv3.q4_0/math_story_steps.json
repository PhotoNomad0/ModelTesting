Help as much as you can.\n\n### User:\nIn Science class, Sara needed 8 test tubes for 3 different experiments. The first experiment required 2 test tubes and the other two experiments required the same number of test tubes. How many test tubes were needed for each of the other two experiments?\n\n### Response:\n\n\nSara, I can help you with that! Let's start by finding out how much time it takes to complete one set of 2 test tubes per experiment and then use this information to find out what number of sets are needed for each remaining experiment. \n\nFirstly, let me know the approximate duration (in minutes) required for completing a single set:"}], "created": 1692784172, "id": "foobarbaz", "model": "ggml-WizardCoder-15B-1.0.ggmlv3.q4_0.bin", "object": "text_completion", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 75, "prompt_tokens": 103, "total_tokens": 178}, "time": "17.82"}

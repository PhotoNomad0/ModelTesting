Help as much as you can.\n\n### User:\nHow do you align a row of divs to the right using flex in css?  Show me an example.\n\n### Response:\n\n\nSure! Here's how we would center-align three `div` elements horizontally and vertically with CSS Flexbox, assuming they have equal width/height dimensions (e.g., each element is a square):\r\n\r\n```html\r\n<div class=\"container\">\r\n  <div>Element 1</div>\r\n  <div>Element 2</div>\r\n  <div>Element 3</div>\r\n</div>\r\n```\r\n\r\nCSS: \r\n\r\n```css\r\n.container {\r\n  display: flex; /* enable Flexbox */\r\n  justify-content: center; /* horizontally align elements to the middle of container */\r\n  align-items: center; /* vertically align elements in the middle of their containers */\r\n}\r\n\r\n/* set width/height dimensions for each element, assuming they are equal size */\r\n.container > div { \r\n  height: 100px; \r\n} \r\n\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis will result in a container with three centered `div` elements that have the same horizontal and vertical center points as their parent container (`.container`)."}], "created": 1692791290, "id": "foobarbaz", "model": "ggml-WizardCoder-15B-1.0.ggmlv3.q4_0.bin", "object": "text_completion", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 230, "prompt_tokens": 66, "total_tokens": 296}, "time": "38.32"}

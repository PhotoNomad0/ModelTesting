{"choices": [{"finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0, "logprobs": null, "references": [], "text": "### System:\nYou are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well. Help as much as you can.\n\n### User:\ncreate a regex expression to extract a three character code like \"1Jn\" from a filename in format \"57-1Jn.usfm\".  The characters can be upper or lower case letters or digits. And the filename extension must be \".usfm\".\n\n### Response:\n\n\nHere is one possible regex expression to extract three character code like '1Jn' from a file name in format \"57-1Jn.usfm\":\r\n\r\n```\r\n^(?<code>\\d{2})-(?<three_char>[a-zA-Z0-9]{3}).*\\.usfm$\r\n``` \r\n\r\nExplanation:\r\n\r\n - `^` matches the start of a string\r\n - `\\d{2}` is a digit character class that represents two digits (e.g., 57) \r\n - `-` matches any hyphen in between, which separates the code from three characters later on\r\n - `[a-zA-Z0-9]{3}` is an alphabetic or numeric character class with exactly three occurrences of either letters or numbers (the actual three characters we are looking for). This will match a string like \"1Jn\" as well. \r\n - `.*` matches any number of non-greedy characters, which includes the period and extension \".usfm\".\r\n - `$` matches the end of a string\r\n\r\nYou can use this regex expression in various programming languages to extract information from file names based on specific patterns or formats that you need."}], "created": 1693336380, "id": "foobarbaz", "model": "ggml-WizardCoder-15B-1.0.ggmlv3.q4_0.bin", "object": "text_completion", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 249, "prompt_tokens": 98, "total_tokens": 347}, "time": "51.65"}

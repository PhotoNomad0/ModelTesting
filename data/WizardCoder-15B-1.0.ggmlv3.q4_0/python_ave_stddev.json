Help as much as you can.\n\n### User:\nin python calculate the average and standard deviation of a list of numbers\n\n### Response:\n\n\nSure, I'm happy to help! To find the mean or median value in Python, we use built-in functions like `sum()` for summation and `/` operator for division. For finding the variance (standard deviation), we need a formula that takes into account both population standard deviation (`std`) as well as sample standard deviation (`stdev`).\n\nHere's an example code snippet to calculate mean, median, variance of list:\r\n\r\n```python\r\nimport statistics # import built-in module for calculating statistical values like mean and stdev. \r\n\r\n# Sample data \r\ndata = [10, 25, 34, 67]\r\n\r\nmean_value = sum(data) / len(data)   # Finding the Mean\r\nmedian_value = statistics.median(data)    # finding median value using built-in function from module 'statistics' \r\nvariance_sample = statistics.pvariance(data, mu=None)  # calculating variance of sample data (population is not given here).\r\n\r\n# To calculate standard deviation for population or sample use the following formulas:\r\nstddeviation_populaton = math.sqrt(variance_population)   #(where 'math' module can be imported to get square root value.) \r\nstdeviation_sample = variance_sample ** 0.5\r\n\r\nprint(\"Mean Value:\", mean_value, \"\\nMedian Value: \", median_value ,\"\\nVariance of Sample Data (Population not given):\",variance_sample)\r\n``` \r\n\r\nOutput for above code snippet will be as follows:<|im_sep|>"}], "created": 1692789895, "id": "foobarbaz", "model": "ggml-WizardCoder-15B-1.0.ggmlv3.q4_0.bin", "object": "text_completion", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 343, "prompt_tokens": 56, "total_tokens": 399}, "time": "53.60"}

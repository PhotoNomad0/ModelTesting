Help as much as you can.\n\n### User:\nin python calculate the average and standard deviation of a list of numbers\n\n### Response:\n\n\nSure, I will help! To find the mean or arithmetic average of a set of data points we need to add up all values in that dataset then divide by its total number. The formula for finding this is as follows:\r\n\r\nMean = (Sum of Data Points) / Number Of Data Points \r\n\r\nTo calculate standard deviation, first you will have to find the mean or arithmetic average using above method and then subtract each data point from it square root(sum((x-mean)^2)/n). Here n refers to number of data points.\r\n\r\nHere's a code snippet in Python:\r\n\r\n\r\n```python\r\nimport math \r\n\r\ndata = [1, 3, -5, 7] # example list of numbers\r\n\r\n# Finding mean \r\nsum_of_numbers = sum(data)\r\nmean = sum_of_numbers / len(data)\r\n\r\nprint(\"Mean:\", mean)<|im_sep|>"}], "created": 1692633824, "id": "foobarbaz", "model": "ggml-WizardCoder-15B-1.0.ggmlv3.q4_0.bin", "object": "text_completion", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 196, "prompt_tokens": 56, "total_tokens": 252}, "time": "35.61"}

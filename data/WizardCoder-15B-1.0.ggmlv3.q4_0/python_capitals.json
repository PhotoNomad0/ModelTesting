Help as much as you can.\n\n### User:\nPython program\nWrite a function named capital_indexes. The function takes a single parameter, which is a string. Your function should return a list of all the indexes in the string that have capital letters\n\n### Response:\n\n\nHere's one way to solve this problem using Python and regular expressions:\r\n\r\n```python\r\nimport re\r\n\r\n\r\ndef capital_indexes(string):\r\n    pattern = r'[A-Z]'  # matches any uppercase letter (using character class)\r\n\r\n    indexes = []\r\n    for match in re.finditer(pattern, string):\r\n        index = match.start() + 1   # add one to account for zero indexing\r\n        if not is_escaped(string[:index]):\r\n            continue                 # skip escaped characters\r\n\r\n        indexes.append(match.start())\r\n    \r\n    return sorted(indexes)\r\n\r\n\r\ndef is_escaped(substring):\r\n    \"\"\"Checks whether a substring starts with an odd number of backslashes.\"\"\"\r\n\r\n    count = 0\r\n    for char in reversed(substring):\r\n        if char == '\\\\':\r\n            count += 1\r\n        else:\r\n            break\r\n            \r\n    # check that the last character before any escape characters (if there are any) is not itself escaped\r\n    return bool((count % 2 != 0 and substring[-1] != 'n') or\r\n                len([c for c in reversed(substring[:-len('\\\\\\\\')]) if c == '\\\\']) > count // 2 - 1)\r\n```\r\n\r\nHere's how the function works:\r\n\r\n1. We import regular expressions (`re`) module to use its `finditer` method, which returns an iterator over all non-overlapping matches of a pattern in a string.\r\n2. The main logic is implemented inside the `capital_indexes()` function that takes one parameter - the input string. \r\n3. Inside this function we define our regular expression pattern as `[A-Z]`, meaning any uppercase letter (using character class). This will match all capital letters and return their starting positions in a list of matches (`match`).\r\n4. We loop over each `match` found by using the iterator returned from `re.finditer()` method, which returns an object that represents one occurrence of our pattern within the string. \r\n5. For every matched position we add 1 to account for zero-indexing and append it to a list called indexes if there is no escape character before this index (escaped characters are denoted by backslashes).\r\n6. Finally, we return sorted `indexes` as output of our function.<|im_sep|>"}], "created": 1692789597, "id": "foobarbaz", "model": "ggml-WizardCoder-15B-1.0.ggmlv3.q4_0.bin", "object": "text_completion", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 476, "prompt_tokens": 83, "total_tokens": 559}, "time": "77.24"}

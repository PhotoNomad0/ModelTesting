Help as much as you can.\n\n### User:\nPython program\nDefine a function named largest_difference that takes a list of numbers as its only parameter.\nYour function should compute and return the difference between the largest and smallest number in the list.\n\n### Response:\n\n\nSure, I'll help you with your Python programming problem! Here's one way to solve it using built-in functions like `min()` and `max()`:\r\n\r\n```python\r\ndef largest_difference(numbers):\r\n    return max(numbers) - min(numbers)\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis function takes a list of numbers as its only parameter, uses the `max()` function to find the highest number in the list (which will be at index 0), and then subtracts that from the result of calling `min()`, which finds the lowest number. The difference between these two values is returned by this function call.\r\n\r\nHere's an example usage:\r\n\r\n```python\r\n>>> numbers = [1, -2, 3, 4]\r\n>>> largest_difference(numbers)\r\n6\r\n```\r\n\r\nIn this case, the highest number in `numbers` (which is `-2`) minus the lowest number (`-2 + 1`, which simplifies to just `0`), gives a difference of `6`."}], "created": 1692789633, "id": "foobarbaz", "model": "ggml-WizardCoder-15B-1.0.ggmlv3.q4_0.bin", "object": "text_completion", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 218, "prompt_tokens": 83, "total_tokens": 301}, "time": "36.19"}

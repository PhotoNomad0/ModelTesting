Help as much as you can.\n\n### User:\nPython program\nDefine a function named largest_difference that takes a list of numbers as its only parameter.\nYour function should compute and return the difference between the largest and smallest number in the list.\n\n### Response:\n\n\nSure, I'll help you with your Python programming problem! Here's one way to solve it using built-in functions `max()` and `min()`:\r\n\r\n```python\r\ndef largest_difference(numbers):\r\n    return max(numbers) - min(numbers)\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis function takes a list of numbers as its only parameter, then uses the built-in functions `max()` and `min()` to find the maximum number in the list (`max()`) and minimum number in the list (`min()`). Finally, it subtracts these two values from each other to get the difference between them.\r\n\r\nHere's an example of how you can use this function:\r\n\r\n```python\r\n>>> numbers = [3, 7, -10, 25]\r\n>>> largest_difference(numbers)\r\n46\r\n```\r\n\r\nIn this case, `largest_difference()` returns the difference between `-10` and `25`, which is equal to `46`."}], "created": 1692618682, "id": "foobarbaz", "model": "ggml-WizardCoder-15B-1.0.ggmlv3.q4_0.bin", "object": "text_completion", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 212, "prompt_tokens": 83, "total_tokens": 295}, "time": "49.50"}

Help as much as you can.\n\n### User:\nin python, using sqlite, get all records where field age is greater than 32\n\n### Response:\n\n\nTo retrieve data from a SQLite database in Python and filter the results based on certain conditions like \"age > 32\", we need to use SQL queries. Here's an example code snippet that demonstrates how this can be done using sqlite3 module of python:\r\n\r\n```python\r\nimport sqlite3\r\n\r\n# create connection object with db file path/name\r\nconn = sqlite3.connect('example_db.sqlite') \r\n\r\n# cursor to execute SQL queries and fetch results \r\ncursor = conn.execute(\"SELECT * FROM table1 WHERE age > 32\")  \r\n\r\nfor row in cursor:\r\n    print(row)\r\n\r\n```\r\n\r\nIn the above code, we first create a connection object with SQLite database file path/name using `sqlite3` module's connect() function and store it as conn. We then use execute() method of Connection class to run an SQL query that retrieves all records from table1 where age is greater than 32 (you can replace \"table1\" in the above code snippet with your actual database table name). The results are stored in a cursor object which we iterate over using for loop and print each row.\r\n\r\nNote: You need to have SQLite installed on your system alongwith Python module `sqlite3` if you want to use this example code, otherwise please refer official documentation of sqlite3 library or ask the relevant experts from online communities like stackoverflow etc.."}], "created": 1692791369, "id": "foobarbaz", "model": "ggml-WizardCoder-15B-1.0.ggmlv3.q4_0.bin", "object": "text_completion", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 292, "prompt_tokens": 61, "total_tokens": 353}, "time": "46.18"}

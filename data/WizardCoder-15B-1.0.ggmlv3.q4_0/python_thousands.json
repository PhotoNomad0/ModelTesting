Help as much as you can.\n\n### User:\nWrite a function named format_number that takes a number as its only parameter.\nYour function should convert the number to a string and add commas as a thousands separator.\n\n### Response:\n\n\nSure, I'll help with your request! Here's an example implementation of `format_number` in Python using f-strings for formatting purposes:\r\n\r\n```python\r\ndef format_number(num):\r\n    return \"{:,}\".format(int(float(str(num))))\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis function first converts the input number to a string, then it casts that string as an integer and float. This is necessary because some numbers may have decimal points or other non-numeric characters in them (e.g., \"123abc\"). Then we use f-strings with `\"{:,}\"` formatting specifier which adds commas for thousands separators to the resulting number, while also converting it back into a string using `.format()` method and returning that value as output of our function.\r\n\r\nHere's an example usage:\r\n```python\r\n>>> format_number(123456789)\r\n '123,456,789' \r\n```"}], "created": 1693567523, "id": "foobarbaz", "model": "ggml-WizardCoder-15B-1.0.ggmlv3.q4_0.bin", "object": "text_completion", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 212, "prompt_tokens": 77, "total_tokens": 289}, "time": "56.41"}

Help as much as you can.\n\n### User:\nExplain origin of standard gauge for railways\n\n### Response:\n\n\nThe Standard Gauge is a metric system used in the Indian Railways to measure distances, speeds and other quantities that are commonly referred to by railway workers. The basic unit of measurement on this scale is the kilometre (km), which has been defined as 1000 meters or one nautical mile (NM). This system was introduced in India's National Railways Act, passed by Parliament in December 2016 and amended several times since then. The Standard Gauge is widely used across the country for railway measurements because it provides a consistent way of measuring distances that can be compared between different routes or trains without any ambiguity about their actual lengths on paper maps, charts or signs."}], "created": 1692584913, "id": "foobarbaz", "model": "ggml-WizardCoder-15B-1.0.ggmlv3.q4_0.bin", "object": "text_completion", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 159, "prompt_tokens": 54, "total_tokens": 213}, "time": "26.62"}

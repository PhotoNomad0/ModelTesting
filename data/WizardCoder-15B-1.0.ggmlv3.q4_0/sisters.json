Starting from Sally, we can count the number of sisters of her brothers recursively. We can keep track of the total number of sisters by adding the number of sisters of each brother. Here's the Python code to implement this:\n\n```python\ndef count_sisters(person):\n    # Base case: a person has no sisters\n    if person.brothers is None:\n        return 0\n    \n    # Recursive case: count the number of sisters of each brother\n    total_sisters = 0\n    for brother in person.brothers:\n        total_sisters += count_sisters(brother)\n    \n    # Add the number of sisters of the current person\n    total_sisters += len(person.sisters)\n    \n    return total_sisters\n```\n\nIn this code, `person` is a `Person` object representing a person in the family tree. The `count_sisters` function takes a person as input and returns the total number of sisters they have.\n\nThe function first checks if the person has no brothers. If so, it returns 0 because a person with no brothers has no sisters.\n\nIf the person has brothers, the function recursively calls itself on each brother to count the number of sisters they have. It then adds the number of sisters of the current person to the total.\n\nNote that this code assumes that each person has a list of brothers and a list of sisters. If this is not the case, you may need to modify the code accordingly.."}, "finish_reason": "stop"}], "usage": {"prompt_tokens": 0, "completion_tokens": 355, "total_tokens": 355}, "time": "63.05"}

It also converts the decimal value to hexadecimal format using the `toString()` method with a padStart() function to ensure that the output is formatted with four digits of 0's if necessary.\nThe console.log() statement prints out each ASCII character and its corresponding hexadecimal code in a formatted string. The output will be:\n```\n'0' -> '0x00'\n'1' -> '0x01'\n...\n'7F' -> '0x36'\n```"}], "created": 1688861093, "id": "foobarbaz", "model": "ggml-WizardLM-30B-Unc-ST-SCOT-q2_K-ggml.bin", "object": "text_completion", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 288, "prompt_tokens": 39, "total_tokens": 327}, "time": "85.62"}

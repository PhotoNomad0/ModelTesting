So, starting from the left:\n- 4 is already a single value, so we don't need to do anything there.\n- The * symbol means multiply, so we need to multiply 2 and 2, which gives us 4.\n- Then we have another multiplication operation with 3, but since it comes after the division operation, we need to perform the division first:\n    - Dividing 10 by 5 gives us 2.\n    - So now we have:\n    25 - (4 * 2 + 3) = 25 - (8 + 3) = 25 - 11 = 14.\nTherefore, the answer is 14."}], "created": 1688862482, "id": "foobarbaz", "model": "ggml-WizardLM-30B-Unc-ST-SCOT-q2_K-ggml.bin", "object": "text_completion", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 186, "prompt_tokens": 31, "total_tokens": 217}, "time": "60.08"}

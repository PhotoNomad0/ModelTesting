The Cardano's formula is not applicable in this case because it can only solve quadratic equations. This equation is a cubic equation. However, we can use numerical methods such as the Newton-Raphson method or the Ferrari's method to approximate the value of x. \nUsing the Ferrari's method, we get:\nx = -130/4 + (9/2) * sqrt(5*((a^2+4*b)/c)) / ((3*a*(a-1)+2*b)^2/(2*c)) \nSubstituting the given values, we get:\nx = -130/4 + (9/2) * sqrt(5*((1^2+4*0)/1)) / ((3*1*(1-1)+2*0)^2/(2*1)) \nSimplifying this expression, we get:\nx = -130/4 + 9/2 * (sqrt(5) / 8) \nx = -17.625 \nTherefore, the value of x is approximately -17.625."}], "created": 1688862635, "id": "foobarbaz", "model": "ggml-WizardLM-30B-Unc-ST-SCOT-q2_K-ggml.bin", "object": "text_completion", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 256, "prompt_tokens": 62, "total_tokens": 318}, "time": "77.19"}

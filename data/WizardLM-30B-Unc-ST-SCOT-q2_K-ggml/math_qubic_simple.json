In this case, we have:\na = 1\nb = -130\nc = -130\nWe can use the fact that the discriminant of this equation is -130^2 < 0, which means there are two real and distinct roots. \nUsing Cardano's formula, we have:\nx_1 = (b/2a) +/- sqrt((b^2-4ac)/4a^2)\nx_2 = -(-b/2a) +/- sqrt((b^2-4ac)/4a^2)\nSubstituting the values of a, b, and c into these formulas, we get:\nx_1 = (-130/1) +/- sqrt((-130^2 - 4*(-130)*(1))/(4*(1)^2))\nSimplifying this expression, we get:\nx_1 = (1)/2 +/- sqrt(69)\nx_2 = (-130/1) +/- sqrt((-130^2 - 4*(-130)*(1))/(4*(1)^2))\nSimplifying this expression, we get:\nx_2 = (1)/2 + sqrt(69)\nTherefore, the two roots of the equation are x_1 = (1)/2 and x_2 = -1.5 + sqrt(69). \nSo the value of x is either x_1 = (1)/2 or x_2 = -0.5 + sqrt(69), depending on which root you want to find."}], "created": 1688862747, "id": "foobarbaz", "model": "ggml-WizardLM-30B-Unc-ST-SCOT-q2_K-ggml.bin", "object": "text_completion", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 401, "prompt_tokens": 39, "total_tokens": 440}, "time": "111.81"}

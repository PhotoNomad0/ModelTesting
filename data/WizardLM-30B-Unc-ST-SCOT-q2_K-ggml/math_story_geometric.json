She would fold five letter size pieces of paper three times then cut along the lines. She would then stack the smaller note papers and staple them together. How long would one notepad last if someone wrote ten notes per day?\nAssuming each sheet can hold 25 lines, a single notepad would have 100 available writing surfaces (5 sheets x 20 lines per sheet). If someone writes 10 notes per day, they would use up one entire notepad in 10/100 or 10% of the total available writing surface. Therefore, a single notepad would last for 100 days if used at a rate of ten notes per day."}], "created": 1688860915, "id": "foobarbaz", "model": "ggml-WizardLM-30B-Unc-ST-SCOT-q2_K-ggml.bin", "object": "text_completion", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 101, "prompt_tokens": 78, "total_tokens": 179}, "time": "44.04"}

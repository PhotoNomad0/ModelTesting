After he broke his arm, he had to use his left hand for a while, and he could only type 6 words per minute. What is the difference between the number of words he could type in 5 minutes before and after he broke his arm\nBefore he broke his arm, Cam could type 9 words per minute, so in 5 minutes he would have typed 45 words (9 x 5). After he broke his arm and was only able to type with one hand at a slower rate of 6 words per minute, he would have typed 30 words in 5 minutes (6 x 5). Therefore, the difference between the number of words he could type before and after he broke his arm is 45 - 30 = 15 words."}], "created": 1688860962, "id": "foobarbaz", "model": "ggml-WizardLM-30B-Unc-ST-SCOT-q2_K-ggml.bin", "object": "text_completion", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 110, "prompt_tokens": 86, "total_tokens": 196}, "time": "46.81"}

The first experiment required 2 test tubes and the other two experiments required the same number of test tubes. How many test tubes were needed for each of the other two experiments?\nLet's call the number of test tubes needed for the second and third experiments \"x\". Since Sara had 8 test tubes in total, we know that the sum of the number of test tubes used for the first experiment and the number of test tubes used for the other two experiments is equal to 8. So:\n2 + x = 8 - x\nSolving this equation, we get:\nx = 4\nSo Sara needed 4 test tubes for each of the other two experiments."}], "created": 1688860871, "id": "foobarbaz", "model": "ggml-WizardLM-30B-Unc-ST-SCOT-q2_K-ggml.bin", "object": "text_completion", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 111, "prompt_tokens": 69, "total_tokens": 180}, "time": "46.79"}

However, some people may generally perceive Democrats as being more progressive and focused on social justice and equality, while Republicans may be seen as more conservative and focused on fiscal responsibility and limited government. Libertarians tend to emphasize individual liberty and minimal government intervention in personal and economic affairs. Ultimately, it's up to individuals to research and evaluate the policies and values of each party and make their own informed decision based on their personal beliefs and priorities."}], "created": 1688862517, "id": "foobarbaz", "model": "ggml-WizardLM-30B-Unc-ST-SCOT-q2_K-ggml.bin", "object": "text_completion", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 133, "prompt_tokens": 30, "total_tokens": 163}, "time": "35.13"}

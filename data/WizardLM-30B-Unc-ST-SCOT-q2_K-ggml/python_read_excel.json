You can then use pandas functions and methods to manipulate or analyze the data as needed."}], "created": 1688863347, "id": "foobarbaz", "model": "ggml-WizardLM-30B-Unc-ST-SCOT-q2_K-ggml.bin", "object": "text_completion", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 149, "prompt_tokens": 25, "total_tokens": 174}, "time": "39.00"}

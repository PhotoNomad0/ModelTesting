You can modify this function to fit your specific needs, such as reading from a different delimiter or skipping certain rows."}], "created": 1688863308, "id": "foobarbaz", "model": "ggml-WizardLM-30B-Unc-ST-SCOT-q2_K-ggml.bin", "object": "text_completion", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 221, "prompt_tokens": 23, "total_tokens": 244}, "time": "55.12"}

Calculate this step by step.\nSure! Let's break it down step by step:\n1. When you were 6, your sister's age was half of your age, which we can represent mathematically as: Sister's age = (Your age)/2\n2. We don't know the exact value of \"your\" age at that time, but we do know that now you are 80. So let's use this information to solve for your sister's current age:\nSister's age now = Sister's age when you were 6 + (Your age now - Your age then)\nSister's age now = 30 + (80-6)\nSister's age now = 42.\nTherefore, your sister is currently 42 years old."}], "created": 1688860825, "id": "foobarbaz", "model": "ggml-WizardLM-30B-Unc-ST-SCOT-q2_K-ggml.bin", "object": "text_completion", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 171, "prompt_tokens": 47, "total_tokens": 218}, "time": "58.58"}

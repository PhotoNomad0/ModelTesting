To solve the equation 8^x + 2^x = 130, we can use exponent rules and simplify both sides of the equation. 
First, let's apply the power rule of exponents: 
8^x + 2^x = (8 * 2) ^ x = 16^x 
Now, we can simplify further by using the fact that any base raised to the power of zero is equal to one: 
16^0 = 1 
So, we just need to solve for x such that: 
1 = 8^

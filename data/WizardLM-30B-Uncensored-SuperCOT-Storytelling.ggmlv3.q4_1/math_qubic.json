First, we check if the discriminant (b^2 - 4ac) is positive or negative. In this case, a=1, b=0, c=-130, and d=-130, so the discriminant is (-1)^2 - 4(1)(-130) = 169 < 0, which means the equation has only one real root. \n", "index": 0, "logprobs": null, "finish_reason": "stop", "references": []}], "usage": {"prompt_tokens": 4096, "completion_tokens": 68, "total_tokens": 113, "thread_count": 4, "prompt_template": "\n### Instruction\nParaphrase the text below by expanding the words based on the subject\n### Human:\n%1\n### Assistant:\n"}, "time": "125.63"}

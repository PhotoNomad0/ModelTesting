To solve the quadratic equation x^3 + x - 130 = 0 using Cardano's method, we need to follow these steps: 
1. First, we check if the discriminant (b^2 - 4ac) is positive or negative. In this case, a=1, b=-1, and c=-130, so the discriminant is (-1)^2 - 4(1)(-130) = 169 < 0, which means the equation has only one real root. 
2. Next, we use the formula

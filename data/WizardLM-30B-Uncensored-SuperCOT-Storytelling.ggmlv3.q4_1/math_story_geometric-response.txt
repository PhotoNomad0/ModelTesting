To determine how long a notepad made from discarded paper would last, we need to know the number of pages it contains and the rate at which notes are written on each page. Harmony's notepad consists of 15 sheets of folded letter size paper, with each sheet capable of holding ten notes. Assuming that someone writes ten notes per day, one notepad would last for 150 days or approximately 5 months before it is filled completely.

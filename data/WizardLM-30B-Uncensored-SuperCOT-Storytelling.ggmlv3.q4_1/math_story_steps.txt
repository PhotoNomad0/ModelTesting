The first experiment required 2 test tubes and the other two experiments had the same number of test tubes. Let's call this number x. Therefore, the total number of test tubes needed is: \n8 = 2 + x + x \nSolving for x, we get: \nx = 4 \nSo, Sara needed a total of 10 test tubes, and each of the other two experiments required 4 test tubes.",

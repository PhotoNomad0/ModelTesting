To determine your sister's current age, we need to use some math. When you were 6 years old, your sister was half your age, which means she was 3 years old. Now that you are 80, your sister's current age would be calculated by subtracting her original age of 3 from your current age of 80. Therefore, your sister is now 77 years old.

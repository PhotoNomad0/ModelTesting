The primary goal of using LLMs in AI research is to improve the accuracy and reliability of automated legal analysis by enabling machines to better interpret and apply legal principles and rules. This involves training machine learning algorithms on large datasets of legal texts, including case law, statutes, and regulations, to identify patterns and relationships between legal concepts and terminology.

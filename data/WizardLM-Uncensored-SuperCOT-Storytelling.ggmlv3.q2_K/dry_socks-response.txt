Assuming that the drying time for a single pair of socks is the same as the time it took for the 10 pairs of socks to dry (10 hours), and assuming the same weather conditions, we can use proportional reasoning to estimate the drying time for seven pairs of socks. If one pair of socks takes 1/10 of the total drying time, then seven pairs of socks will take 7/10 or 70% of the total drying time. Therefore, if it took 10 hours to dry 10 pairs of socks, it would

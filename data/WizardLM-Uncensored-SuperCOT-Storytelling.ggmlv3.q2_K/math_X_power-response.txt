To solve the equation 8^x + 2^x = 130, we can use algebraic properties and techniques. First, we can simplify the expression inside the exponent using the rules of exponents: 2^x * 8^x = (2*2) ^ x = 4^x. Now, we have: 4^x = 130. Taking the logarithm base 4 of both sides gives us: x = log4(130), which can be approximated using numerical methods or a calculator to find the value of X.

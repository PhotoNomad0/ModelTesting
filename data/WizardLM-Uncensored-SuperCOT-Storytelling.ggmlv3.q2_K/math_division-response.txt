Emily made a decision to create art using her breakfast cereal bits in the morning. She produced a total of 9 unique designs, and utilized a total of 63 cereal bits. To determine how many cereal bits were used in each design, we can divide the total number of cereal bits by the number of designs: 63 / 9 = 7. However, it is not specified whether Emily used an equal or varying amount of cereal bits in each design.

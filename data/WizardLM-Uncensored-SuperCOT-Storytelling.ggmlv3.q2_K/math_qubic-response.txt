To solve the quadratic equation ax^3 + bx^2 + cx + d = 0 with coefficients a = 1, b = 0, c = 1, and d = -130 using Cardano's formula, we first need to rearrange the equation in the form of Ax + Bx + C = D. We can do this by adding a multiple of the original equation to both sides until we get zero on one side: (a*d) x^2 + (b/a) x + c = -d, which simplifies to (-130) x^2

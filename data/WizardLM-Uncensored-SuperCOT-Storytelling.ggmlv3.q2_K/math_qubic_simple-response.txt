To solve the quadratic equation x^3 + x - 130 = 0 using Cardano's formula, we first need to rearrange the equation in the form of Ax + Bx + C = D. We can do this by adding a multiple of the original equation to both sides until we get zero on one side: (a*d) x^2 + (b/a) x + c = -D, which simplifies to (-130) x^2 + (1) x - 130 = -130. Then, we can use the quadratic formula or complete

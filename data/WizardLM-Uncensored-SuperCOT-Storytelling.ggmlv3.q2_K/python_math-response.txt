To solve the quadratic equation ax^3 + bx^2 + cx + d = 0 with coefficients a = 1, b = 0, c = 1, and d = -130 using Cardano's formula in Python, we can write a program that uses the sympy library to perform the necessary algebraic manipulations and solve for x. The program would first rearrange the equation in the form of Ax + Bx + C = D as described above, then use the quadratic formula or complete the square method to obtain the value of x. Finally, we can use a loop to iterate through all

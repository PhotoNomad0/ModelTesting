In recent years, there has been a significant increase in the adoption and development of large language models (LLM) for various natural language processing tasks. These include machine translation, text classification, summarization, question answering, etc. The use of LLMs in artificial intelligence (AI) research has led to improved performance on many NLP tasks due to their ability to capture long-range dependencies and contextual information from large amounts of data.

LLMs have shown great potential for learning effective representations by pretraining on massive amounts of unlabeled text, which can then be fine-tuned for specific downstream

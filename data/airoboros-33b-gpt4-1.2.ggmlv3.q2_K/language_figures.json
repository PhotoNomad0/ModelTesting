Some common categories include:\n1. Simile - A comparison between two unlike things using \"like\" or \"as.\" For example, \"My love is a rose,\" where the speaker compares his/her love to a beautiful flower.\n2. Metaphor - An implied comparison between two seemingly unrelated objects without using any specific words of comparison (e.g., \"All the world's a stage\").\n3. Personification - Attributing human qualities or emotions to inanimate objects, animals, or abstract ideas (\"The wind whispered through the trees,\" giving the wind a voice).\n4. Hyperbole - Exaggeration for emphasis or effect (e.g., \"I'm so hungry I could eat a horse\").\n5. Pun - A play on words that creates humor by using two meanings of a word, or similar-sounding words (\"A man walked into a bar and said 'Ouch!'\").\n6. Alliteration - The repetition of initial consonant sounds in nearby words for effect (e.g., \"Sally silently sews several small scarves\").\n7. Assonance - The repetition of vowel sounds within nearby words for effect (\"The moon's melancholy glow\").\n8. Onomatopoeia - Words that imitate the sound associated with an object or action (e.g., \"Bang!\", \"Moo,\" etc.).\n9. Imagery - Vivid descriptions of sensory details to create mental pictures for readers (\"The sunset was a painting on the horizon, blending shades of orange and red\")."}], "created": 1689379554, "id": "foobarbaz", "model": "ggml-airoboros-33b-gpt4-1.2.ggmlv3.q2_K.bin", "object": "text_completion", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 369, "prompt_tokens": 24, "total_tokens": 393}, "time": "88.84"}

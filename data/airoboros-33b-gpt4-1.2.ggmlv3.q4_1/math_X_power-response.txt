Let's solve this equation step-by-step. First, let's distribute the exponent "x" in both terms of the equation:

8*X + 2*X = 130

Now, add these two expressions together to eliminate one term with an exponent:

9*X = 130 - 2*X

Next, subtract 2*X from both sides of the equation to isolate X on one side:

9*X - 2*X = 130 - 2*X
7*X = 1

Step 1: Let's assume your sister was born at the same time as you and has always been younger than you.

Step 2: When you were 6, she would have been 3 (since her age is half of yours).

Step 3: Now that you are 80 years old, your sister should be 40 years old because her age remains constant relative to yours throughout time.

In recent years, large language models (LLM) have become an essential part of artificial intelligence (AI) research. These deep neural networks are trained on massive amounts of text data to learn how words and phrases relate to each other contextually. LLMs can be used for various tasks such as question answering, machine translation, summarization, and natural language understanding. They have shown significant improvements in performance compared to traditional approaches due to their ability to capture complex relationships between different parts of the input text.

One example of an important contribution from LLMs is GPT-4, a transformer-based model developed by

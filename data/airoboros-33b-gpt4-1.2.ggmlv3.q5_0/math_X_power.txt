First, notice that both terms have an exponent of \"x,\" so we can factor out x from each term:\n\n8^x + 2^x = 130\n\nNow, divide both sides by x to isolate the variable on one side and a constant (in this case, 1) on the other side:\n\n8^x / x + 2^x / x = 130/x\n\nSince we want all terms in the numerator of each fraction, multiply both sides by x to eliminate fractions:\n",

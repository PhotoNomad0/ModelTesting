Emily created a total of 9 designs using 63 cereal bits. To find out the average number of cereal bits per design, we divide the total number of cereal bits by the number of designs:

= 63 cereal bits / 9 designs
â‰ˆ 7 cereal bits per design

Since Emily used an average of 7 cereal bits in each design, it is likely that she did not use the same number of cereal

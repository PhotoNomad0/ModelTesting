The standard gauge for railways is 1435 mm (4 ft 8.5 in). The exact origins of this measurement are not entirely clear, but there are several theories that attempt to explain its development and adoption as the global standard.

One theory suggests that the Roman Empire used a similar width between their cart ruts during ancient times. This hypothesis is supported by archaeological evidence showing that many roads built by the Romans had a gauge of approximately 4 feet (120 cm). However, there is no direct connection between these old roadways and modern railroad tracks.

Expert 1:\nTom washed 10 pairs of socks, which means he had 20 socks in total (10 pairs x 2). He hung them outside to dry and waited for 10 hours. During this time, the weather conditions remained the same.\n\n2. Expert 2:\nIf we assume that each pair of socks takes the same amount of time to dry as all 10 pairs did together, then it would take Tom another 10 hours to dry seven pairs of socks (7 x 10 = 70 socks).\n\n3. Expert 3:\nHowever, since Tom already had 20 socks hanging outside for 10 hours, we can subtract that time from the total drying process. So, it would take him an additional 10 hours - 10 hours = 0 hours to dry seven pairs of socks (7 x 0 = 0 socks).\n\nFinal answer: It will take Tom 0 hours to dry seven pairs of socks if the same weather conditions are maintained."}, "finish_reason": "stop"}], "usage": {"prompt_tokens": 0, "completion_tokens": 228, "total_tokens": 228}, "time": "158.67"}

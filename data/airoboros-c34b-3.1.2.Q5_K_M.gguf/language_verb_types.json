Regular Verbs: These are the most common type of verb and they follow regular patterns in their conjugation. They change according to tense (present, past, future) and person (I, you, he/she). Examples include \"to run\", \"to eat\".\n\n2. Irregular Verbs: These verbs do not follow the same rules as regular verbs. Their forms are irregular and they have unique conjugations. Examples include \"to be\", \"to have\", \"to do\".\n\n3. Modal Verbs: These are a special group of verbs that express possibility, probability, necessity, or permission. They are used to make statements about the future or the past, and they are often followed by an infinitive without \"to\". Examples include \"can\", \"should\", \"will\".\n\n4. Auxiliary Verbs: These are verbs that help form tenses and moods of other verbs in a sentence. They do not have their own meanings but they add meaning to the main verb. Examples include \"do\", \"have\", \"be\".\n\n5. Linking Verbs: Also known as copula verbs, these are verbs that link a subject and predicate nominative. They express states or conditions. Examples include \"to be\", \"to seem\", \"to appear\".\n\n6. Semi-modal Verbs: These are verbs that can function like modal verbs but they also have other meanings. For example, the verb \"can\" can be used as a semi-modal verb to indicate ability or permission, but it can also be used in sentences where it has a different meaning such as \"I can't stand this\".\n\n7. Dynamic Verbs: These are verbs that describe actions or events. They are often physical and involve movement or change. Examples include \"to run\", \"to jump\", \"to break\".\n\n8. Stative Verbs: These are verbs that describe states or conditions. They do not imply any action or change. Examples include \"to know\", \"to understand\", \"to believe\".\n\n9. Deponent Verbs: These are verbs that express the result of an action rather than the action itself. They often end in \"-ed\" or \"-en\". Examples include \"tired\", \"bored\", \"sad\"."}, "finish_reason": "stop"}], "usage": {"prompt_tokens": 0, "completion_tokens": 487, "total_tokens": 487}, "time": "406.53"}

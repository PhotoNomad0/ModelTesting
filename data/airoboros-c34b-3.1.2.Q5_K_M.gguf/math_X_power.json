First, let's rewrite the equation in terms of a single base:\n\n(8^X)^1 * (2^X)^1 = 130^1\n\nNow, we can use the property of exponents that says (a^m)(a^n) = a^(m+n):\n\n8^X * 2^X = 130\n\nNext, we'll take the logarithm base 2 of both sides to isolate X:\n\nlog\u2082(8^X * 2^X) = log\u2082(130)\n\nSince log\u2082(a^b) = b*log\u2082(a), we can rewrite this as:\n\nX*log\u2082(8) + X*log\u2082(2) = log\u2082(130)\n\nNow, we can simplify the left side using the property of logarithms that says log\u2082(a^b) = b*log\u2082(a):\n\nX*(log\u2082(8) + log\u2082(2)) = log\u2082(130)\n\nWe know that log\u2082(8) = 3 and log\u2082(2) = 1, so:\n\nX*(3+1) = log\u2082(130)\n\nNow, we can solve for X:\n\nX*(4) = log\u2082(130)\nX = log\u2082(130)/4\nX \u2248 1.75\n\nSo, the solution to the equation is approximately X = 1.75."}, "finish_reason": "stop"}], "usage": {"prompt_tokens": 0, "completion_tokens": 324, "total_tokens": 324}, "time": "169.72"}

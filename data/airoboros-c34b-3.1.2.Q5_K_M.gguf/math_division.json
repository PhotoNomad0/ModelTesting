Emily created 9 designs with a total of 63 cereal bits.\n2. To find out how many cereal bits were used in each design, we divide the total number of cereal bits by the number of designs: 63 / 9 = 7 cereal bits per design.\n3. Since Emily used an equal number of cereal bits in each design, it is likely that she used approximately 7 cereal bits in each design.\n\nFinal answer: About 7 cereal bits were used in each design, and yes, it seems like she used an equal number of cereal bits in each design."}, "finish_reason": "stop"}], "usage": {"prompt_tokens": 0, "completion_tokens": 148, "total_tokens": 148}, "time": "101.92"}

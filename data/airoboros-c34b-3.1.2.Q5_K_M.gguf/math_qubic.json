We are given that a = 1, b = 0, c = 1 and d = -130. Plugging these values into the equation, we get:\n\nx^3 + x + 130 = 0\n\nNow let's apply Cardano's formula to solve this cubic equation. First, divide both sides by x:\n\nx^2 + 1 + \\frac{130}{x} = 0\n\nLet y = x + \\frac{1}{x}. Then,\n\ny^2 - 2 = -\\frac{130}{x}\n\nSquaring both sides, we get:\n\ny^4 - 4y^2 + 169 = \\frac{16900}{x^2}\n\nNow let's define u = y^2. Then,\n\nu^2 - 4u + 169 = \\frac{16900}{x^2}\n\nThis is a quadratic equation in u with solutions:\n\nu_1 = 8 and u_2 = 13\n\nNow we can find the values of y by solving for u:\n\ny_1 = \\pm\\sqrt{8} = \\pm2\\sqrt{2}\ny_2 = \\pm\\sqrt{13} = \\pm\\sqrt{13}\n\nSince x is positive, we have only two possible solutions for y:\n\ny_1 = 2\\sqrt{2} and y_2 = -\\sqrt{13}\n\nNow let's find the corresponding values of x by solving for y:\n\nx_1 = \\frac{-1}{2\\sqrt{2}} = -0.7071i\nx_2 = \\frac{-\\sqrt{13}}{-2\\sqrt{2}} = 0.4659 + 1.8545i\n\nSo the two solutions for x are:\n\nx_1 = -0.7071i and x_2 = 0.4659 + 1.8545i"}, "finish_reason": "stop"}], "usage": {"prompt_tokens": 0, "completion_tokens": 452, "total_tokens": 452}, "time": "330.79"}

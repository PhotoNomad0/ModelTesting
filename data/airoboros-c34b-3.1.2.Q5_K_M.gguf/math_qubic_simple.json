We can rewrite it as x^3 - 130 = x using Vieta's formulas. Now, let y be the real root of this equation. Then, we have:\n\ny^3 - 130 = y\n\nNow, let us consider the function f(x) = x^3 - 130. We can see that f'(x) = 3x^2 and f''(x) = 6x. The critical points of this function are at x = \u00b1\u221a10. Since f''(x) changes sign at these points, they correspond to local minima and maxima respectively.\n\nAt x = -\u221a10, we have f(-\u221a10) = (-\u221a10)^3 - 130 = -260 < 0, so this is a local maximum. Similarly, at x = \u221a10, we have f(\u221a10) = (\u221a10)^3 - 130 = 940 > 0, so this is a local minimum.\n\nSince the function is continuous and differentiable on the entire real line, it must attain its maximum at either x = -\u221a10 or x = \u221a10, and its minimum at the other point. Since f(x) < 0 for all x < -\u221a10 and f(x) > 0 for all x > \u221a10, we can conclude that the real root of the equation must lie in the interval [-\u221a10, \u221a10].\n\nNow, let us apply Cardano's formula to find the value of y. We have:\n\ny^3 - 130 = y\n(y^2 + 1)^2 = (y + 130)(y - 130)\n\nLet u = y^2 + 1 and v = y + 130. Then, we have:\n\nu^2 - 4v = 0\n\nNow, let us solve for u in terms of v:\n\nu = \u00b1\u221a(4v)\n\nSince y is a real root, we must choose the positive square root:\n\ny^2 + 1 = \u00b12\u221a(4v)\ny^2 = \u00b12\u221a(4v) - 1\ny = \u00b1\u221a[2\u221a(4v) - 1]\n\nNow, let us substitute v with y + 130:\n\ny = \u00b1\u221a[2\u221a(4(y + 130)) - 1]\n\nWe can simplify this expression further by noting that 4(y + 130) = (y^2 + 1)^2, which is equal to u^2:\n\ny = \u00b1\u221a[2u - 1]\n\nNow, we have two possible values for y:\n\ny_1 = \u221a[2u - 1]\ny_2 = -\u221a[2u - 1]\n\nSince the original equation has only one real root, we must choose the positive value of y. Therefore, our final answer is:\n\ny = \u221a[2u - 1], where u = y^2 + 1 and v = y + 130"}, "finish_reason": "stop"}], "usage": {"prompt_tokens": 0, "completion_tokens": 691, "total_tokens": 691}, "time": "469.71"}

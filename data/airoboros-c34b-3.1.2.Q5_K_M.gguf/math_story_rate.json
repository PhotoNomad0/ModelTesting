Before Cam broke his arm, he could type 9 words per minute. So, in 5 minutes, he would be able to type:\n   9 words/minute * 5 minutes = 45 words\n2. After breaking his arm, Cam had to use his left hand and could only type 6 words per minute. In 5 minutes, he would be able to type:\n   6 words/minute * 5 minutes = 30 words\n3. Now we need to find the difference between these two numbers:\n   Difference = Number of words after breaking arm - Number of words before breaking arm\n   Difference = 30 words - 45 words\n   Difference = -15 words\n\nThe final answer is that Cam could type 15 fewer words in 5 minutes after he broke his arm."}, "finish_reason": "stop"}], "usage": {"prompt_tokens": 0, "completion_tokens": 185, "total_tokens": 185}, "time": "144.95"}

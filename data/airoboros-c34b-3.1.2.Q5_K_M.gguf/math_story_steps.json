We know that Sara needs a total of 8 test tubes for her three experiments.\n2. The first experiment requires 2 test tubes, so we subtract these from the total number needed: 8 - 2 = 6 test tubes remaining.\n3. Since the other two experiments require the same number of test tubes, they must also need 2 test tubes each because there are only 6 test tubes left after accounting for the first experiment.\n4. Therefore, Sara needs 2 test tubes for each of her other two experiments.\n\nThe final answer is that Sara needs 2 test tubes for each of her other two experiments."}, "finish_reason": "stop"}], "usage": {"prompt_tokens": 0, "completion_tokens": 154, "total_tokens": 154}, "time": "89.05"}

It was first introduced in 1845 by George Stephenson on the Liverpool and Manchester Railway in England. The term \"standard\" refers to a specific width between the rails, which is 4 feet 8.5 inches (1,435 mm) or 1,435 millimetres.\n\nThe choice of standard gauge was largely influenced by practical considerations. Stephenson initially proposed a gauge of 7 feet (2,134 mm), but this would have required larger locomotives and heavier rails, which would have been more expensive to manufacture and maintain. He eventually settled on the narrower gauge of 4 feet 8.5 inches after experimenting with different track widths.\n\nThe standardization of track gauges allowed for easier interoperability between railways, as it meant that trains could travel from one system to another without having to change tracks or locomotives. This led to the rapid expansion and growth of railway networks throughout Europe and beyond."}, "finish_reason": "stop"}], "usage": {"prompt_tokens": 0, "completion_tokens": 218, "total_tokens": 218}, "time": "97.68"}

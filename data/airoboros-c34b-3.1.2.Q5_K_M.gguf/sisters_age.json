When you were 6 years old, your sister was half your age. So when you were 6, your sister was 3 years old.\n2. Now you are 80 years old. To find out how many years older your sister is compared to when you were both 6 years old, we need to subtract the number of years you have aged from the total number of years that have passed since you and your sister were both 6 years old.\n3. So, firstly, let's calculate how many years have passed since you and your sister were both 6 years old:\nYears passed = Current year - (Your current age) + (Your sister's current age))\n4. Now that we know how many years have passed since you and your sister were both 6 years old, let's plug these numbers into the equation from Step 3 to find out how many years older your sister is compared to when you were both 6 years old:\nYears older = (Your current age) - (Your sister's current age)))\n5. Now that we know how many years older your sister is compared to when you were both 6 years old, let's add these numbers together with the number of years that have passed since you and your sister were both 6 years old from Step 3 to find out how old your sister currently is:\nYears current age = (Your sister's current age) + (Years passed)))\n\nSo now we know how many years older your sister is compared to when you were both 6 years old, and we also know how old your sister currently is."}, "finish_reason": "stop"}], "usage": {"prompt_tokens": 0, "completion_tokens": 345, "total_tokens": 345}, "time": "352.42"}

We know that when the person was 6 years old, their sister was half her age. So, if the person was 6, then their sister would be 3.\n2. Now we are told that the person is now 80 years old. Since they were 6 when their sister was born, this means that there have been 74 years between the time their sister was born and the present day.\n3. To find out how old their sister is now, we add the age difference (74) to her original age of 3: 3 + 74 = 77.\n\nSo, the person's sister is currently 77 years old."}, "finish_reason": "stop"}], "usage": {"prompt_tokens": 0, "completion_tokens": 151, "total_tokens": 151}, "time": "134.10"}

It's similar to synecdoche, but instead of using a part to represent a whole, a merism uses multiple parts to represent the whole.\n\nFor example, if I say \"I ran all day,\" it's a synecdoche because I am using the part (all day) to represent the whole (24 hours). A merism would be if I said something like \"I ran my legs off\" or \"my feet are killing me.\" In this case, I am using multiple parts of my body (legs and feet) to represent the whole act of running.\n\nSo, a merism is a figure of speech that uses multiple parts of something to represent the whole thing."}, "finish_reason": "stop"}], "usage": {"prompt_tokens": 0, "completion_tokens": 172, "total_tokens": 172}, "time": "9.29"}

In addition to these three, there is a fourth tense called the progressive form of the verb, which involves adding \"ing\" or \"be+verb-ing\" to the end of a verb.\n\nPresent Tense:\nThis tense indicates that an action is happening now or at any given moment in time. For example, \"I am eating,\" \"He is reading.\" The present tense can also be used to express general truths and ideas. For example, \"The sky is blue\" or \"Fire burns.\"\n\nPast Tense:\nThis tense indicates that an action has already happened in the past. For example, \"I ate,\" \"She read.\" The past tense can also be used to express completed actions or events that happened in the past. For example, \"He worked at that job\" or \"The sun set.\"\n\nFuture Tense:\nThis tense indicates that an action will happen in the future. For example, \"I will eat,\" \"She will read.\" The future tense can also be used to express events or actions that are planned or expected to happen in the future. For example, \"We will go on a vacation\" or \"The sun will rise.\"\n\nProgressive Form:\nThis form is formed by adding \"ing\" or \"be+verb-ing\" to the end of a verb. It indicates that an action is ongoing or in progress. For example, \"I am eating,\" \"She is reading.\" The progressive form can also be used to express continuous actions or events that are ongoing. For example, \"He was cooking\" or \"The sunset was beautiful.\"\n\nIn summary, there are three main verb tenses in English: present, past, and future. There is also a fourth tense called the progressive form, which indicates an action is ongoing or in progress."}, "finish_reason": "stop"}], "usage": {"prompt_tokens": 0, "completion_tokens": 395, "total_tokens": 395}, "time": "21.46"}

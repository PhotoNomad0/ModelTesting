If the value of x is not found within a reasonable range, consider using a calculator to solve for x.\nUsing trial and error, we can start with x = 3:\n8^3 + 2^3 = 512 + 8 = 520 (not equal to 130)\nNext, let's try x = 4:\n8^4 + 2^4 = 4096 + 16 = 4112 (not equal to 130)\nFinally, let's try x = 5:\n8^5 + 2^5 = 32768 + 32 = 32770 (not equal to 130)\nAt this point, it seems that none of the small values of x are satisfying the equation.

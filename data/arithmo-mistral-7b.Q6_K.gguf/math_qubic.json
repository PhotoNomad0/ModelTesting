Using Cardano's formula, we can rewrite the equation as follows:\n\nAx^3 + Bx^2 + Cx + D = 0\n(x - r1)(x - r2)(x - r3) = 0\n\nwhere r1, r2, and r3 are the roots of the equation.\n\nTo find the values of x where the equation is equal to zero, we can use the fact that at these points the product of the factors (x - r1), (x - r2), and (x - r3) is equal to zero:\n\n(x - r1)(x - r2)(x - r3) = 0\n\nNow, let's plug in the values for A, B, C, and D from the given equation:\n\n(x - r1)(x - r2)(x - r3) = (x - (-b / a))(x - r2)(x - r3)\n\nSince b = 0, we have:\n\n(x + 1)(x - r2)(x - r3) = 0\n\nNow, let's find the values of x where the equation is equal to zero:\n\nx + 1 = 0 => x = -1\n\nFor the other two roots, we can use the fact that the sum and product of the roots are given by:\n\nr1 + r2 + r3 = -B / A = 0\nr1 * r2 + r2 * r3 + r3 * r1 = D / A = -130\n\nSince b = 0, we have:\n\nr1 + r2 + r3 = 0\nr2 * r3 + r3 * r1 + r1 * r2 = -130\n\nWe can rewrite the first equation as:\n\nr2 + r3 = -r1\n\nAnd substitute this into the second equation:\n\n(-r1) * r3 + r3 * (-r1) + r1 * (-r1) = -130\n\nSimplifying, we get:\n\n-2 * r1 * r3 = -130\n\nNow, let's assume that r1 is a positive real number. This means that r3 must be negative. We can write r3 as -r3, and substitute it into the equation:\n\n-2 * r1 * (-r3) = -130\n\nSimplifying, we get:\n\n2 * r1 * r3 = 130\n\nDividing both sides by 2, we have:\n\nr1 * r3 = 65\n\nNow, let's substitute the value of r3 from above back into the equation:\n\nr1 * (-r1) = 65\n\nSimplifying, we get:\n\n-r1^2 = 65\n\nDividing both sides by -1, we have:\n\nr1^2 = -65\n\nSince r1 is a real number, this equation has no solution. Therefore, the given equation does not have any real roots."}, "finish_reason": "stop"}], "usage": {"prompt_tokens": 0, "completion_tokens": 715, "total_tokens": 715}, "time": "68.59"}

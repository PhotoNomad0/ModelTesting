In this case, I will demonstrate how to use the synthetic division method to solve the equation.\n\nFirst, let's write the equation in the form of a polynomial:\nx^3 + x - 130 = 0\n\nNow, let's divide the polynomial by a 3rd degree polynomial to find the roots. We can use x as the divisor since it is a cubic polynomial. The synthetic division will look like this:\n\n       ____________________\nx |   x^3 + x - 130\n       ____________________\n     1 |     x^2 + 1 - 130\n         ____________________\n           x |   -x^2 + 1 - 130\n              ______________\n                        x^2 + 1 - 130\n                        ______________\n                          -x + 131\n                          ______________\n                            131\n\nThe remainder is 131, which means that x = 131 is a root of the equation. Now, we can perform synthetic division again to find the other roots:\n\n       ____________________\nx |   -x^2 + 1 - 130\n       ____________________\n     1 |     -x^2 + x - 129\n         ____________________\n           x |       x^2 - x - 129\n              ______________\n                        x^2 - x - 129\n                        ______________\n                          -130\n\nThe remainder is -130, which means that the other two roots are complex conjugates of each other. We can find these roots by solving the quadratic equation:\n\nx^2 - x - 129 = 0\n\nUsing the quadratic formula, we get:\n\nx = (1 \u00b1 \u221a(1 + 4 * 1 * (-129))) / 2\nx = (1 \u00b1 \u221a(-483)) / 2\n\nSo, the other two roots are:\n\nx = (1 - \u221a(-483)) / 2 and x = (1 + \u221a(-483)) / 2\n\nIn summary, the solutions of the equation x^3 + x - 130 = 0 are:\n\nx = 131, x = (1 - \u221a(-483)) / 2, and x = (1 + \u221a(-483)) / 2."}, "finish_reason": "stop"}], "usage": {"prompt_tokens": 0, "completion_tokens": 591, "total_tokens": 591}, "time": "3645.43"}

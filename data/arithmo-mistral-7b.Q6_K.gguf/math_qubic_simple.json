Comparing this with the given equation, we have:\na = 1\nb = 1\nc = -130\nd = 0\nNext, we need to find two numbers p and q such that p^3 + bp^2 + cp + d = 0 and pq = c. From the given equation, we have:\np^3 + p^2 - 130 = 0\nNow, we can use Cardano's formula to find the values of x:\nx = (p + q \u00b1 sqrt((p + q)^2 - 4(pq))) / 2a\nSubstituting the values of p, q, and a:\nx = (p + q \u00b1 sqrt((p + q)^2 - 4pq)) / 2\nSince we know that pq = c = -130, we can rewrite the equation as:\nx = (p + q \u00b1 sqrt((p + q)^2 + 520)) / 2\nNow, we need to find two numbers p and q that satisfy the equation p^3 + p^2 - 130 = 0. We can use numerical methods or trial and error to find these values. Let's assume p = 6 and q = -21:\np = 6\nq = -21\nx = (6 + (-21) \u00b1 sqrt((6 + (-21))^2 + 520)) / 2\nx = (-15 \u00b1 sqrt(81 + 520)) / 2\nx = (-15 \u00b1 sqrt(599)) / 2\nSo, the solutions for x are:\nx = (sqrt(599) - 15) / 2 or x = (-sqrt(599) - 15) / 2\nThese are the values of x that satisfy the equation x^3 + x - 130 = 0 using Cardano's formula."}, "finish_reason": "stop"}], "usage": {"prompt_tokens": 0, "completion_tokens": 484, "total_tokens": 484}, "time": "31.41"}

In India, 1676 mm (5' 5 3/8\") is the gauge adopted for broad gauged railway. This is known as the 'Standard Gauge'. The adoption of the standard gauge in India was a long and evolutionary process.\n\nFirstly, in 1849-50, the Bombay Baroda and Central Indian Railway (BB & CI) adopted the 2143 mm (7' 0\") gauge for their line between Mumbai and Thane. Later, it was found that this broad gauge is not suitable for India, where there is a large number of short distance trains carrying passengers and commodities like coal, etc., over short distances. Thereafter, the East Indian Railway (EIR) adopted 1676 mm (5' 5 3/8\") as the gauge for its line between Ranghat and Dhanbad in 1890-91. Thereafter, this 'Standard Gauge' has been adopted by all the other Railways of India also, except the BB & CI which continued to use the broad gauge of 2143 mm (7' 0\") until 1951, when it was replaced by the standard gauge.\nThus, the EIR was the pioneer in adopting the Standard Gauge and as a result, it has become the most widely used gauge in India for both passenger and freight services."}, "finish_reason": "stop"}], "usage": {"prompt_tokens": 0, "completion_tokens": 324, "total_tokens": 324}, "time": "17.84"}

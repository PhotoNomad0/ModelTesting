Write a response that appropriately completes the request.\n\n### Instruction:\nIn the morning, Emily decided to create some designs with her cereal bits. In total, she created 9 designs and used 63 cereal bits. About how many cereal bits were in each design? Do you think she used an equal number of cereal bits in each design?\n\n### Response:\n\nTo determine the average number of cereal bits per design, we would need to calculate the total number of cereal bits and divide it by the number of designs. This will give us an idea of how many cereal bits were used in each design."}], "created": 1692961609, "id": "foobarbaz", "model": "ggml-chronos-hermes-13b-v2.ggmlv3.q4_K_M.bin", "object": "text_completion", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 54, "prompt_tokens": 114, "total_tokens": 168}, "time": "15.01"}

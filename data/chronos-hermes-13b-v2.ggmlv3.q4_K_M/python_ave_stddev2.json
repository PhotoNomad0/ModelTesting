Write a response that appropriately completes the request.\n\n### Instruction:\nWrite a python function to calculate the average and standard deviation of a list of numbers\n\n### Response:\n\nTo begin, let's define our problem. We want to find an algorithm that can accurately predict future stock prices based on historical data. \nWe have access to large datasets containing millions of rows and columns of financial information. Our goal is to develop a machine learning model that can make accurate predictions about future stock prices. \nTo do this, we need to first preprocess the dataset by removing any missing values or outliers. We then split the data into training, validation and testing sets. Finally, we train our models using stochastic gradient descent (SGD). This allows us to fine-tune our model's parameters during training in order for better generalization performance at test time."}], "created": 1692962185, "id": "foobarbaz", "model": "ggml-chronos-hermes-13b-v2.ggmlv3.q4_K_M.bin", "object": "text_completion", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 144, "prompt_tokens": 65, "total_tokens": 209}, "time": "23.14"}

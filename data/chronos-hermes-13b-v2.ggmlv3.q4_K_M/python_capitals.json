Write a response that appropriately completes the request.\n\n### Instruction:\nPython program\nWrite a function named capital_indexes. The function takes a single parameter, which is a string. Your function should return a list of all the indexes in the string that have capital letters\n\n### Response:\n\nHere's how you can write your Python code to implement this feature:- Create an instance variable 'capital_indexes'.- Define a method called 'get_capital_indexes()', which takes two arguments:- The first argument is the string itself.- The second argument is the list of all indexes in the string that have capital letters.In your implementation, you can use any combination of characters to represent an index. For example, if we have a string \"Hello World!\", we could define it as follows:string = 'Hello World!'capital_indexes = ['H', 'W']This would give us the indexes for each character in our string.- Define another method called 'get_all_indices()', which takes two arguments:- The first argument is the list of all indices in the string that have lowercase letters.- The second argument is the list of all indices in the string that have uppercase letters.In your implementation, you can use any combination of characters to represent an index.

Finally solve the equation using numerical methods like Newton-Raphson method or Levenberg-Simons algorithm."}], "created": 1692961809, "id": "foobarbaz", "model": "ggml-chronos-hermes-13b-v2.ggmlv3.q4_K_M.bin", "object": "text_completion", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 97, "prompt_tokens": 79, "total_tokens": 176}, "time": "18.58"}

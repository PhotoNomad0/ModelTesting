As you may recall from our last meeting, I have decided to leave the company and pursue other opportunities. While it is true that we had some disagreements during my time here, ultimately they did not affect my decision to move on.In fact, one of the main reasons for leaving was due to personal growth within myself as well as professionally speaking - both areas where progress has been made over recent years! Please do not hesitate to reach out if there is anything else you would like me to assist with going forward; your continued success remains paramount in ensuring sustained excellence across all aspects of business operations.Thank You Sincerely Yours TrulyJohn Smith"}], "created": 1692962478, "id": "foobarbaz", "model": "ggml-chronos-hermes-13b-v2.ggmlv3.q4_K_M.bin", "object": "text_completion", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 153, "prompt_tokens": 64, "total_tokens": 217}, "time": "23.97"}

Write a response that appropriately completes the request.\n\n### Instruction:\nExplain origin of standard gauge for railways\n\n### Response:\n\nThe use of standard gauge for railways can be traced back to the early 19th century when George Stephenson, a British engineer and inventor, developed it. At that time, most European countries were still using broad gauge tracks which made interoperability between them more difficult due to incompatibilities in track gauges.\nTo address this issue, Stephenson proposed converting all broad-gauge lines overseas by adopting standard gauge instead - allowing for easier movement of people and goods across borders while maintaining compatibility with other countries' rail networks worldwide.\""}], "created": 1692961640, "id": "foobarbaz", "model": "ggml-chronos-hermes-13b-v2.ggmlv3.q4_K_M.bin", "object": "text_completion", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 119, "prompt_tokens": 58, "total_tokens": 177}, "time": "20.22"}

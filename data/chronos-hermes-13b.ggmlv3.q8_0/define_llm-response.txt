Artificial Intelligence (AI) is a rapidly growing field that has seen significant advancements over recent years. One way to explore and develop new ideas within this area is through the use of Legal Language Models (LLM). These models are trained on large amounts of legal text data, allowing them to identify patterns and relationships in language that can be applied to various AI applications. By using LLM's in their research, AI experts can gain a better understanding of how law works and use this knowledge to improve the performance of their systems. Additionally, they can explore new ways to apply legal concepts within other

Write a response that appropriately completes the request.\n\n### Instruction:\nwhy does this command give error Permission denied (publickey):\n\nssh -i \"~/UserKey.pem\" -C -L 25900:localhost:5900 ec2-34-221-131-108.us-west-2.compute.amazonaws.com\n\n### Response:\n\nThe error message \"Permission denied (publickey)\" indicates that the SSH server is not allowing access to your user account due to a mismatch between the public key and the private key used for authentication. \nTo troubleshoot this issue, you can follow these steps:\n1. Verify that the UserKey.pem file exists in the specified directory (~/ by default). If it doesn't exist, create a new SSH key pair using the following command: ssh-keygen -f ~/.ssh/id_rsa\n2. Check if your user account has permission to access the remote server. You can do this by logging into the EC2 instance and checking the security group settings or by contacting the AWS administrator for assistance. \n3. If you have multiple SSH keys, try using a different one that is authorized on the remote server. To list all of your available keys, use the following command: ssh-add -l\n4. Finally, if none of these steps resolve the issue, it may be necessary to contact AWS support for further assistance."}], "created": 1692964714, "id": "foobarbaz", "model": "ggml-chronos-hermes-13b.ggmlv3.q8_0.bin", "object": "text_completion", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 221, "prompt_tokens": 122, "total_tokens": 343}, "time": "36.74"}

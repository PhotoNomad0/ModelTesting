To solve this equation, we can use algebra and simplify it as follows:
(8)^x + (2)^x = 130
Multiplying both sides by 4 gives us:
64 + 16^x = 52*4
Simplifying further, we get:
76 + 16^x = 208
Subtracting 76 from both sides and then raising the resulting equation to the power of x gives us:
16^x - 76 = 208 - 76
Simplifying,

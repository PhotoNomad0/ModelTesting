Write a response that appropriately completes the request.\n\n### Instruction:\n25 - 4 * 2 + 3 = ?\nShow your work.\n\n### Response:\n\nTo solve this equation, we need to follow these steps:\n1. First, we need to perform the multiplication operation inside the parentheses: 4 * 2 = 8.\n2. Then, we can substitute the result back into the original equation: 25 - 8 + 3 = ?\n3. Finally, we can solve for the variable by performing addition or subtraction operations: 17 + 3 = 20. Therefore, the answer to the equation is 20."}], "created": 1692961218, "id": "foobarbaz", "model": "ggml-chronos-hermes-13b.ggmlv3.q8_0.bin", "object": "text_completion", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 107, "prompt_tokens": 67, "total_tokens": 174}, "time": "25.00"}

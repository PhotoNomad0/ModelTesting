First, we need to perform any multiplication or division that has numbers in front of it. In this case, there is no multiplication or division, so we move on to step 2.\n2. Next, we need to perform any addition or subtraction that has numbers in parentheses (), exponents (), or inside a mathematical symbol like square root (\u221a) or percent (%). In this equation, there are no parentheses, exponents, or other symbols, so we move on to step 3.\n3. Finally, we need to perform any multiplication or division from left to right. Starting with the numbers in front of the equals sign (=), we multiply and divide as needed until we get a final answer:\n25 - (4 * 2) + 3 = 10\nTherefore, the solution is 10."}], "created": 1688774454, "id": "foobarbaz", "model": "ggml-chronos-hermes-13b.ggmlv3.q8_0.bin", "object": "text_completion", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 196, "prompt_tokens": 31, "total_tokens": 227}, "time": "43.22"}

Since you are not a prime number and between 20 and 40, we can assume that your age is a perfect square. Let's start by finding all possible values of n:\n- If n=1, the equation becomes (1)^2 + 1 = sqrt(1^3+2), which simplifies to 2 = sqrt(3). This is not a valid solution since 2 is not between 20 and 40.\n- If n=2, the equation becomes (2)^2 + 1 = sqrt(2^3+2), which simplifies to 5 = sqrt(8). This is also not a valid solution since 5 is greater than 40.\n- If n=3, the equation becomes (3)^2 + 1 = sqrt(3^3+2), which simplifies to 6 = sqrt(27). This is still not a valid solution since 6 is less than 20.\n- Continuing this pattern, we can see that there are no perfect square values of n between 1 and 4 that satisfy the equation. Therefore, you must be over 40 years old or have an age that cannot be expressed as a perfect square."}], "created": 1689379669, "id": "foobarbaz", "model": "ggml-chronos-hermes-13b.ggmlv3.q8_0.bin", "object": "text_completion", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 303, "prompt_tokens": 48, "total_tokens": 351}, "time": "102.37"}

Write a response that appropriately completes the request.\n\n### Instruction:\nin ax^3+bx^2+c*x+d=0, use the cardano's formula to get the value for x where a=1, b=0, c=1 and d=-130\n\n### Response:\n\nCardano's Formula is used to solve cubic equations. Here are the steps to find the solution using Cardano's Formula:\n\nStep 1: Write down the coefficients of x in the given equation as a, b, c and d. In this case, they are 1, 0, 1 and -130 respectively.\n\nStep 2: Calculate the values of p and q by solving the following system of equations:\np^3 + q^3 = a^3 (which is 1)\np^2 + q^2 = b^2 (which is 0)\n4pq(p+q) = c^3 (which is 1)\n\nStep 3: Calculate the value of r by solving the following system of equations:\nr^3 - p^3 - q^3 = d/c^2 (which is (-130)/1^2, which simplifies to -130)\n4pr(p+q)(r-p-q) = 0\n\nStep 4: Calculate the value of x by solving the following system of equations:\nx = p/r or x = q/r (since r is not equal to zero, we can divide both sides by it without losing any information)\nSubstitute one of these values into either equation in Step 2 and solve for p and q. Then substitute those values back into the system of equations from Step 3 to find the value of r. Finally, substitute that value of r into either equation in Step 4 to get the final solution for x.\n\nUsing Cardano's Formula, we can find the value of x where a=1, b=0, c=1 and d=-130 as follows:\n\nStep 2: p = (-b^2 + sqrt(b^4 - 4ac))/2a; q = (b^2 - sqrt(b^4 - 4ac))/2a\nSubstituting the given values, we get:\np = (-0)^3 + sqrt((-0)^6 - 4*1*(-130))/(2*1)\nq = (0)^3 - sqrt((-0)^6 - 4*1*(-130))/(2*1)\nSimplifying the expressions, we get:\np = (-1/2)*sqrt(5^3 + 8)\nq = (-1/2)*sqrt(5^3 + 8)\nSubstituting these values into Step 3 and solving for r, we get:\nr = sqrt((-d)/c^2 - p^3 - q^3) / (4pq(p+q))\nSimplifying the expression using the given value of d (-130), we get:\nr = sqrt(-1/16 + 5^3 + 8) / ((-1/2)*sqrt(5^3 + 8)) * (4*((-1/2)*sqrt(5^3 + 8)))\nMultiplying both sides by -1, we get:\nr = sqrt(-16 + 5^3 + 8) / ((-1/2)*sqrt(5^3 + 8)) * (4*((-1/2)*sqrt(5^3 + 8)))\nSubstituting this value of r into either equation in Step 4, we get:\nx = (-b^2 + sqrt(b^4 - 4ac))/(2a) / ((-1/2)*sqrt(5^3 + 8)) * (4*((-1/2)*sqrt(5^3 + 8))) or x = (-b^2 - sqrt(b^4 - 4ac))/(2a) / ((-1/2)*sqrt(5^3 + 8)) * (4*((-1/2)*sqrt(5^3 + 8)))\nSimplifying the expressions, we get:\nx = (-0.7961)/((-1/2)*sqrt(5^3 + 8)) or x = (0.7961)/((-1/2)*sqrt(5^3 + 8))\nTherefore, there are two possible solutions for the given equation:\nx = (-0.7961)/((-1/2)*sqrt(5^3 + 8)) or x = (0.7961)/((-1/2)*sqrt(5^3 + 8))"}], "created": 1692963300, "id": "foobarbaz", "model": "ggml-chronos-hermes-13b.ggmlv3.q8_0.bin", "object": "text_completion", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 1002, "prompt_tokens": 98, "total_tokens": 1100}, "time": "156.28"}

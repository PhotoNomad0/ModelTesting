However, we know that the solutions for this equation are real numbers, so we can discard -1 as a solution. Therefore, x = 7 is the only possible value for x in this equation."}], "created": 1689452703, "id": "foobarbaz", "model": "ggml-chronos-hermes-13b.ggmlv3.q8_0.bin", "object": "text_completion", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 199, "prompt_tokens": 32, "total_tokens": 231}, "time": "55.36"}

Write a response that appropriately completes the request.\n\n### Instruction:\nin x^3+x-130=0, solve for the value for x\n\n### Response:\n\nTo solve this equation, we need to use factoring techniques. \nFirst, let's look at the coefficients of each term in the equation. We can see that the coefficient of x^3 is 1 and the constant term (the number outside the parentheses) is -130. This means that if we multiply these two numbers together, we get a perfect square: \n(-130)^2 = 16900 \nNext, let's look at the middle term in the equation (-x). We can see that it has an exponent of 1 and is multiplied by -1. This means that if we multiply these two numbers together, we get a perfect square: \n(-1)(-x) = x^2 \nNow let's combine these two factors to create our equation for factoring the polynomial: \n(x^3 + x^2 - 16900) * (x^2 - x + 1) = 0 \nWe can now use this equation to solve for the value of x. To do so, we need to set each term equal to zero and then solve for x: \n(x^3 + x^2 - 16900) * (x^2 - x + 1) = 0 \nSimplifying this equation gives us: \n(x^5 - 17000x^4 + 81000x^3 - 1690000x^2 + 16900000x - 1) * (x^2 - x + 1) = 0 \nSetting each term equal to zero and solving for x gives us: \n(x^5 - 17000x^4 + 81000x^3 - 1690000x^2 + 16900000x - 1) = 0 \nx^2 - x + 1 = 0 \n(x-1)(x+1)=0 \nTherefore, the solutions for this equation are: \nx=1 or x=-1"}], "created": 1692963480, "id": "foobarbaz", "model": "ggml-chronos-hermes-13b.ggmlv3.q8_0.bin", "object": "text_completion", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 472, "prompt_tokens": 68, "total_tokens": 540}, "time": "74.62"}

Write a response that appropriately completes the request.\n\n### Instruction:\nin x^3+x-130=0, use the cardano's formula to get the value for x\n\n### Response:\n\nCardano's formula is used to solve cubic equations of the form ax^3 + bx^2 + cx = d. \nTo apply this method to find the roots of the equation x^3+x-130=0, we need to follow these steps:\n\nStep 1: Rewrite the equation in standard form by completing the square.\n(x - 5)(x + 2) = 0\n\nStep 2: Find two numbers whose product is equal to one of the coefficients and whose sum is equal to the other coefficient. In this case, we need to find a and b such that ab = d (where d = 130). We can choose a = -5 and b = 2 since their product is -10 and their sum is -7, which are close to the given coefficients (-5) and (-6), respectively.\n\nStep 3: Substitute these values of a and b into Cardano's formula. The general form of this formula is:\nx = (p/2a + q/2b)^(1/(2*m)) * ((-a - mb)/(-am + bm))^(1/2) \nwhere p, q are any two numbers such that pa + qb = d. In our case, we have:\nx = (p/2a + q/2b)^(1/(2*3)) * ((-5 - 6)/(-5 + 6))^(1/2)\nWe can solve for p and q by setting them equal to the coefficients of x in the original equation. We get:\nx = (-40/8 + 7/8)^(1/(2*3)) * ((-5 - 6)/(-5 + 6))^(1/2)\nSimplifying this expression, we get:\nx = (10/9)^(1/(2*3)) * ((-5 - 6)/(-5 + 6))^(1/2)\nx = (-40/8 + 7/8)^(1/(2*3)) * ((-5 - 6)/(-5 + 6))^(1/2)\nx = (10/9)^(1/(2*3)) * ((-5 - 6)/(-5 + 6))^(1/2)\nTherefore, the value of x in the equation x^3+x-130=0 is approximately equal to (-40/8 + 7/8)^(1/(2*3)) * ((-5 - 6)/(-5 + 6))^(1/2), which simplifies to about -1.98 or -2.\nSo, the roots of x^3+x-130=0 are approximately equal to (-40/8 + 7/8)^(1/(2*3)) * ((-5 - 6)/(-5 + 6))^(1/2) and (-40/8 + 7/8)^(1/(2*3)) * ((-5 - 6)/(-5 + 6))^(1/2)."}], "created": 1692963406, "id": "foobarbaz", "model": "ggml-chronos-hermes-13b.ggmlv3.q8_0.bin", "object": "text_completion", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 682, "prompt_tokens": 75, "total_tokens": 757}, "time": "105.94"}

However, I can provide some information about each political party's stance on various issues to help you make an informed decision based on your own values and beliefs. \nRepublican Party: The Republican Party generally supports smaller government, lower taxes, strong national defense, and traditional family values. They tend to be pro-life when it comes to abortion and oppose same-sex marriage. Some Republicans have been criticized for their stance on immigration reform and climate change.\nDemocratic Party: The Democratic Party generally supports a larger government role in providing social services, higher taxes to fund those programs, and progressive policies such as universal healthcare and environmental protection. They tend to be pro-choice when it comes to abortion and support same-sex marriage rights. Some Democrats have been criticized for their stance on national security and economic issues.\nLibertarian Party: The Libertarian Party generally supports individual liberty, free markets, and limited government involvement in personal affairs. They tend to be pro-choice when it comes to abortion and support same-sex marriage rights. Some libertarians have been criticized for their stance on national security and environmental protection.\nIn conclusion, there is no clear \"less bad\" option among these three political parties as each has its own strengths and weaknesses based on individual values and beliefs."}], "created": 1688774518, "id": "foobarbaz", "model": "ggml-chronos-hermes-13b.ggmlv3.q8_0.bin", "object": "text_completion", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 303, "prompt_tokens": 30, "total_tokens": 333}, "time": "63.78"}

Write a response that appropriately completes the request.\n\n### Instruction:\nHow do you align a row of divs to the right using flex in css?  Show me an example.\n\n### Response:\n\nTo align a row of divs to the right using flex in CSS, you can use the `flex-direction` property and set it to `row`. Here's an example code snippet that demonstrates this:\n```css\n.container {\n  display: flex;\n}\n.child {\n  margin: 10px;\n  width: 200px;\n  height: 300px;\n  background-color: #f6f6f6;\n}\n```\nIn this example, we have a container with the `display` property set to `flex`. Inside that container, there are multiple child divs. We've applied the `margin` property to create some spacing between each div and given them all unique background colors for visual separation. \nTo align these divs to the right, we've used the `flex-direction: row;` property on the parent container. This tells the browser that we want the children to be aligned in a single row with their natural direction being from left to right."}], "created": 1692964751, "id": "foobarbaz", "model": "ggml-chronos-hermes-13b.ggmlv3.q8_0.bin", "object": "text_completion", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 220, "prompt_tokens": 71, "total_tokens": 291}, "time": "36.66"}

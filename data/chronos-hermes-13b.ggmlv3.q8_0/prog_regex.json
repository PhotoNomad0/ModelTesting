Write a response that appropriately completes the request.\n\n### Instruction:\ncreate a regex expression to extract a three character code like \"1Jn\" from a filename in format \"57-1Jn.usfm\".  The characters can be upper or lower case letters or digits. And the filename extension must be \".usfm\".\n\n### Response:\n\nHere's a regular expression that should work for you:\n```regex\n^[0-9]+(-)[a-zA-Z]{3}$\n```\nExplanation:\n- `^` matches the start of the string.\n- `[0-9]+` matches one or more digits at the beginning of the filename (before the hyphen).\n- `-` matches the actual hyphen character in the middle of the filename.\n- `[a-zA-Z]{3}` matches three characters that are either uppercase or lowercase letters after the hyphen.\n- `$` matches the end of the string.\nThis regular expression should work for any file name format as long as it follows the pattern described above (with a three character code and a \".usfm\" extension)."}], "created": 1693310090, "id": "foobarbaz", "model": "ggml-chronos-hermes-13b.ggmlv3.q8_0.bin", "object": "text_completion", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 166, "prompt_tokens": 104, "total_tokens": 270}, "time": "79.24"}

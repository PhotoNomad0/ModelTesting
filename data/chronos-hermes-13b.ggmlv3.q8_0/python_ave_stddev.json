Here's an example code that calculates the average and standard deviation of a list of numbers in Python: \n```python\nnumbers = [1,2,3,4,5]\navg = sum(numbers) / len(numbers)\nstd_dev = math.sqrt((sum([x - avg for x in numbers]) ** 2) / (len(numbers)))\nprint(\"Average:\", avg)\nprint(\"Standard Deviation:\", std_dev)\n```\nThis code first creates a list of numbers `[1,2,3,4,5]`. Then it calculates the average by adding up all the numbers and dividing by the length of the list. The standard deviation is calculated using the formula `sqrt((sum([x - avg for x in numbers]) ** 2) / (len(numbers)))` where `[x - avg for x in numbers]` generates a new list with each number subtracted from the average, and then takes the square root of that sum divided by the length of the original list. Finally, it prints out both values using `print()`."}], "created": 1688818780, "id": "foobarbaz", "model": "ggml-chronos-hermes-13b.ggmlv3.q8_0.bin", "object": "text_completion", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 239, "prompt_tokens": 26, "total_tokens": 265}, "time": "33.30"}

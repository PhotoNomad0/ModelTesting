You can test it with different lists to see how it works:\n```python\nnumbers = [1,2,3,4] # Example list\nprint(largest_difference([1, 2, 3, 4])) # Output: 3\n# Try other examples too!\n```"}], "created": 1688774617, "id": "foobarbaz", "model": "ggml-chronos-hermes-13b.ggmlv3.q8_0.bin", "object": "text_completion", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 188, "prompt_tokens": 55, "total_tokens": 243}, "time": "39.29"}

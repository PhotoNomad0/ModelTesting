It starts by checking if the number is less than 2, and returns False in that case. Then it checks all numbers from 2 up to the square root of the given number plus one using a for loop. If any of these numbers divide evenly into the given number without leaving a remainder (i.e., they are factors), then `is_prime` returns False immediately and stops checking further numbers. Otherwise, it continues iterating through all possible factors until it finds one or reaches the end of the range.\nIf no factors are found, `is_prime` returns True for that number. If a factor is found but the given number is greater than 2 (i.e., not a prime), then we append that non-prime to our list of primes and continue checking other numbers until we reach or exceed the maximum value of 1000.\nFinally, we print out all the primes in order using a for loop with an incrementing index variable `i`. The formatted string `%d` is used to replace each number with its corresponding index in the list of primes."}], "created": 1688774699, "id": "foobarbaz", "model": "ggml-chronos-hermes-13b.ggmlv3.q8_0.bin", "object": "text_completion", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 436, "prompt_tokens": 28, "total_tokens": 464}, "time": "81.91"}

Write a response that appropriately completes the request.\n\n### Instruction:\nwrite a Python program to print out the first 100 prime numbers\n\n### Response:\n\nHere's a Python code snippet that prints the first 100 prime numbers:\n```python\nfor i in range(2, int(math.sqrt(100))+1): # iterate from 2 to sqrt of 100 + 1 (i.e., 9)\n    if is_prime(i): # check if the number is prime using a function\n        print(i) # if it's prime, print it\n```\nThis code uses a for loop to iterate from 2 to sqrt of 100 + 1 (which is 9 in this case). For each number i within that range, we check if it's prime using the `is_prime` function. If it's prime, we print it out using the `print` statement.\nNote: The `math.sqrt(100)` part of the code calculates the square root of 100 to ensure that we don't miss any primes between 2 and sqrt(100) (which would be 9 in this case)."}], "created": 1692963674, "id": "foobarbaz", "model": "ggml-chronos-hermes-13b.ggmlv3.q8_0.bin", "object": "text_completion", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 234, "prompt_tokens": 64, "total_tokens": 298}, "time": "38.23"}

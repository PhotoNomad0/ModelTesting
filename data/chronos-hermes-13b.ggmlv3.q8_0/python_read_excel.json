Write a response that appropriately completes the request.\n\n### Instruction:\nwrite a python function to read from an excel spreadsheet.\n\n### Response:\n\nHere's a Python function that reads data from an Excel spreadsheet using the openpyxl library:\n```python\nimport openpyxl\ndef read_excel(filename):\n    # Open the workbook and select the worksheet to read\n    wb = openpyxl.load_workbook(filename)\n    sheet = wb['Sheet1']\n    \n    # Read data from the selected range of cells\n    start_row, end_row = sheet.max_row - 20, sheet.min_row + 1\n    start_col, end_col = sheet.max_column - 5, sheet.min_column + 3\n    \n    data = []\n    for row in range(start_row, end_row+1):\n        col = [sheet[i].value for i in range(start_col, end_col+1)]\n        data.append([cell.value for cell in col])\n        \n    return data\n```\nThis function takes a filename as input and opens the Excel workbook using openpyxl library. It then selects the worksheet to read from and reads data from the selected range of cells (starting at row 20, ending at row 1). The function returns a list containing all the values in the selected range."}], "created": 1692963811, "id": "foobarbaz", "model": "ggml-chronos-hermes-13b.ggmlv3.q8_0.bin", "object": "text_completion", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 283, "prompt_tokens": 61, "total_tokens": 344}, "time": "43.70"}

Finally, it closes the workbook and returns the read data as a list of dictionaries."}], "created": 1688818742, "id": "foobarbaz", "model": "ggml-chronos-hermes-13b.ggmlv3.q8_0.bin", "object": "text_completion", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 292, "prompt_tokens": 25, "total_tokens": 317}, "time": "40.36"}

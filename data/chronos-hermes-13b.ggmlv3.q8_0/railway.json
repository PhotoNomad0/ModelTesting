Write a response that appropriately completes the request.\n\n### Instruction:\nExplain origin of standard gauge for railways\n\n### Response:\n\nThe standard gauge for railway tracks was originally established in England during the 1820s and 1830s, when several different gauges were used. The decision to adopt a single standard gauge was made by the Great Western Railway Company (GWR) under the guidance of Isambard Kingdom Brunel.\n\nBrunel had observed that narrow-gauge railways required more gradients and curves than wider ones, which led to higher maintenance costs and slower speeds. He believed that a standard gauge would be more efficient and cost-effective in the long run. The GWR adopted a gauge of 4 feet 8\u00bd inches (1,435 mm) for its main line between London Paddington Station and Bristol Temple Meads Station, which became known as Brunel's broad gauge.\n\nHowever, other railway companies were not convinced by the benefits of this new standard, and they continued to use their own gauges. This led to difficulties in interchangeability and compatibility among different railways, which hindered the growth of the industry. In 1846, a Royal Commission was established to investigate these issues, and it recommended that all railway companies should adopt Brunel's broad gauge as the standard for future construction.\n\nDespite this recommendation, many companies continued to use their own gauges, leading to confusion among passengers and goods transporters. In 1862, a new Royal Commission was established to investigate these issues further, and it recommended that all railway companies should adopt Brunel's broad gauge as the standard for future construction.\n\nFinally, in 1870, an Act of Parliament was passed requiring all railways built after this date to use Brunel's broad gauge (4 feet 8\u00bd inches) as the standard gauge for Britain and its colonies. This decision led to a gradual conversion from other gauges over time, resulting in today's standard gauge of 1,435 mm being used worldwide."}], "created": 1692961137, "id": "foobarbaz", "model": "ggml-chronos-hermes-13b.ggmlv3.q8_0.bin", "object": "text_completion", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 424, "prompt_tokens": 58, "total_tokens": 482}, "time": "77.32"}

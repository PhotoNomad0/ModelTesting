Write a response that appropriately completes the request.\n\n### Instruction:\nSally has 3 brothers. Her brothers have 2 sisters. How many sisters does Sally have?\n\n### Response:\n\nLet's break down the information given in the prompt step by step to solve this problem:\n1. We know that Sally has 3 brothers, so let's represent her with a \"S\" and her three brothers as \"B1\", \"B2\", and \"B3\".\n2. Her brothers have two sisters each, represented as \"G1\" for the first brother, \"G2\" for the second brother, and \"G3\" for the third brother. \n3. Therefore, Sally has a total of four sisters: G1, G2, G3, and another sister who is not named in the prompt. We can represent this unknown sister as \"Sister4\".\nSo the answer to the problem is that Sally has 4 sisters."}], "created": 1692961338, "id": "foobarbaz", "model": "ggml-chronos-hermes-13b.ggmlv3.q8_0.bin", "object": "text_completion", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 167, "prompt_tokens": 73, "total_tokens": 240}, "time": "38.52"}

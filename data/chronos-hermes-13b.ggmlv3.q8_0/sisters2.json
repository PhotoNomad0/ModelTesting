Write a response that appropriately completes the request.\n\n### Instruction:\nSally is a girl with 3 brothers. Her brothers have 2 sisters. How many sisters does Sally have?\n\n### Response:\n\nLet's break down the information given in the problem statement and use some logical reasoning to solve it step by step.\n1) We know that Sally has 3 brothers, so we can represent this using a variable \"b\" (for brother). Therefore, b = 3.\n2) Her brothers have 2 sisters, which means she shares her siblings with them. So let's represent the number of sisters shared by all three brothers as \"s\". We know that s is even because it represents a common value for Sally and her two brothers to share. Therefore, s = 2 (since there are only two possible values for an even number - 0 or 2).\n3) Now we can use the fact that Sally has three brothers who each have one-half of their shared sisters as individual siblings. This means that if she shares \"x\" half-sisters with her eldest brother, then her other two brothers will share (1/2 x) - 0 = (1/2 x) full sisters among themselves.\n4) We can represent the number of half-sisters shared by Sally and her eldest brother as \"h\". Therefore, h = x.\n5) Now we know that if she shares \"x\" half-sisters with her eldest brother, then her other two brothers will share (1/2 x) - 0 = (1/2 x) full sisters among themselves. This means that the total number of full sisters shared by Sally and all three of her brothers is equal to:\n   - The half-sisters she shares with her eldest brother +\n   - (The half-sisters she doesn't share with her eldest brother) x 2 =\n   0.5x + (1/2 x) x 2 = 1.5x full sisters shared among all three brothers.\n6) Therefore, the total number of full sisters that Sally has is equal to:\n   - The half-sisters she shares with her eldest brother +\n   0.5x (since there are two other siblings who share 1/2 x full sisters among themselves) =\n    1.5x full sisters shared among all three brothers.\n7) So the answer to our question is that Sally has a total of 3 half-sisters and 4.5 (rounded up to 5) full sisters in her family."}], "created": 1692963092, "id": "foobarbaz", "model": "ggml-chronos-hermes-13b.ggmlv3.q8_0.bin", "object": "text_completion", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 533, "prompt_tokens": 76, "total_tokens": 609}, "time": "83.56"}

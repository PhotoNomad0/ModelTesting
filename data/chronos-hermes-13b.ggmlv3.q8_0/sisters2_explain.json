Write a response that appropriately completes the request.\n\n### Instruction:\nSally is a girl with 3 brothers. Her brothers have 2 sisters. How many sisters does Sally have? Explain your answer\n\n### Response:\n\nLet's break down the information given in the problem statement step by step to solve it:\n- Sally is a girl with 3 brothers. We know that she has at least one brother, so her family must have had more than one child for her to be the third or later born. Let's assume that all of her siblings are present in the current generation (i.e., no one died young).\n- Her brothers have 2 sisters. This means that Sally has at least two female cousins who are younger than she is, since they share a common grandparent with her but not their parents. Let's assume that all of these cousins are present in the current generation (i.e., no one died young).\n- Now we can use basic algebra to solve for Sally's number of sisters: \nLet x be the number of female cousins who are younger than she is, and let y be the number of her siblings (including herself). Then:\nx + y = 2   // since there are two sisters in total\ny = 2 - x    // simplifying equation to solve for y\nSo Sally has at least one female cousin who is younger than she is, and two or more siblings. Therefore, her number of sisters can range from zero (if all of her brothers have daughters) up to three (if both of her brothers have sons). However, we cannot determine the exact number without additional information about Sally's family tree."}], "created": 1692963143, "id": "foobarbaz", "model": "ggml-chronos-hermes-13b.ggmlv3.q8_0.bin", "object": "text_completion", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 321, "prompt_tokens": 80, "total_tokens": 401}, "time": "50.83"}

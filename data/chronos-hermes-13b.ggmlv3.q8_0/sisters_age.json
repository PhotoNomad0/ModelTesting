Write a response that appropriately completes the request.\n\n### Instruction:\nwhen I was 6, my sister was half my age. Now I am 80. How old is my sister now? Calculate this step by step.\n\n### Response:\n\nLet's start with the given information and work our way through it step-by-step to find out how old your sister is now.\n\nWhen you were 6, your sister was half of your age at that time. So her age would have been (12 - 6) / 2 = 3 years old.\n\nNow let's fast forward to when you are 80 years old. Your sister's current age can be calculated by subtracting the number of years between now and when she was half your age:\n\nAge difference = (current age - previous age) / 2\n= (80 - 3) / 2\n= 74 / 2\n= 37\n\nTherefore, your sister is currently 37 years old."}], "created": 1692960844, "id": "foobarbaz", "model": "ggml-chronos-hermes-13b.ggmlv3.q8_0.bin", "object": "text_completion", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 169, "prompt_tokens": 83, "total_tokens": 252}, "time": "39.14"}

How old is my sister now?\nTo solve this problem, we need to use algebra and the concept of equivalent ratios. Let's assume that your sister's current age is x years. When you were both 6, her age was half of yours (let's call it h), which means she was 3 years old at that time. Now, using algebra:\n80 = 2x + 3(h)\nSimplifying the equation:\n40 = x - h\nSubtracting 40 from both sides of the equation:\n-h = x - 40\nAdding 40 to both sides of the equation:\nh = x\nTherefore, your sister's current age is equal to your present age."}], "created": 1689419584, "id": "foobarbaz", "model": "ggml-chronos-hermes-13b.ggmlv3.q8_0.bin", "object": "text_completion", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 157, "prompt_tokens": 40, "total_tokens": 197}, "time": "80.11"}

Write a response that appropriately completes the request.\n\n### Instruction:\nwhen I was 6, my sister was half my age. Now I am 80. How old is my sister now?\n\n### Response:\n\nTo solve this problem, we need to use algebra and set up an equation using variables for the ages of both individuals at different points in time. Let's call me \"x\" (for example, if I was 6 years old when my sister was half my age, then x = 6) and let's call my sister \"y\".\n\nThe first part of the problem states that when I was 6, my sister was half my age. We can represent this algebraically as:\n\nx/2 = y (since my sister is half my age at that time)\n\nNow we need to find out what x and y are now, given that I am 80 years old. To do so, we set up another equation using the information provided in the problem statement:\n\ny + 60 = 80 (since my sister is now 2/3 of my age)\n\nWe can solve for x and y by substituting one equation into the other:\n\nx/2 = y\ny + 60 = 80\n\nSimplifying the first equation, we get:\n\nx = 12 (since half of any number is always even)\n\nSubstituting this value back into either equation, we find that my sister's age now is:\n\ny + 60 = 80\n74 = y\n\nTherefore, my sister is currently 74 years old."}], "created": 1692960909, "id": "foobarbaz", "model": "ggml-chronos-hermes-13b.ggmlv3.q8_0.bin", "object": "text_completion", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 310, "prompt_tokens": 76, "total_tokens": 386}, "time": "64.76"}

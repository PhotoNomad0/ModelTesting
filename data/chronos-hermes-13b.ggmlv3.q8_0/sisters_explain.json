Write a response that appropriately completes the request.\n\n### Instruction:\nSally has 3 brothers. Her brothers have 2 sisters. How many sisters does Sally have? Explain your answer\n\n### Response:\n\nLet's break down the information given in the problem statement to solve it step by step.\n\n1) We know that Sally has 3 brothers, so we can represent her siblings as follows:\n```\nSisters = 0\nBrothers = 3\n```\n2) Her brothers have 2 sisters each, which means the total number of sisters in their family is:\n```\nTotal Sisters = (Number of Brothers x Number of Sisters per Brother) = (3 x 2) = 6\n```\n3) Since Sally has the same number of sisters as her brothers' combined sister count, we can represent it like this:\n```\nSisters = Total Sisters - Number of Brothers + 1 = 6 - 3 + 1 = 4\n```\nTherefore, Sally has 4 sisters."}], "created": 1692963009, "id": "foobarbaz", "model": "ggml-chronos-hermes-13b.ggmlv3.q8_0.bin", "object": "text_completion", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 188, "prompt_tokens": 77, "total_tokens": 265}, "time": "82.48"}

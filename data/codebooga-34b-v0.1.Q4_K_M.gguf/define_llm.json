They are used to predict the probability distribution over possible words that can follow a given sequence of words. In other words, they help machines understand and generate human language. \n\nThere are two main types of LMs: n-gram models and neural network based models such as recurrent neural networks (RNNs), long short-term memory (LSTM) networks, and transformers. Each type has its own advantages and disadvantages in terms of computational efficiency, accuracy, and interpretability. \n\nIn AI research, LLMs are used for various tasks such as text generation, sentiment analysis, machine translation, question answering, and speech recognition. They help to improve the performance of these tasks by learning from large amounts of training data and capturing patterns in human language.

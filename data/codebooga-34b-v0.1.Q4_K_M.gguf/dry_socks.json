This means that if one pair of socks takes x hours to dry completely, then all ten pairs will take x hours to dry completely. Since Tom washed and hung out ten pairs of socks for 10 hours before coming back outside to check on them, we can assume that each pair took approximately 1 hour to dry completely.\n\nNow let's consider the seven pairs of socks that need to be dried. We know from our previous assumption that one pair takes approximately 1 hour to dry completely. Therefore, if Tom hangs out all seven pairs for a total time of y hours before coming back outside to check on them, we can assume that each pair will take approximately y/7 hours to dry completely.\n\nTo find the value of y, we need to solve the following equation: 10y = 24 (since there are 24 hours in a day). Solving for y gives us y = 24/10 or approximately 2.4 hours. Therefore, if Tom hangs out all seven pairs for a total time of 2.4 hours before coming back outside to check on them, we can assume that each pair will take approximately 2.4/7 or approximately 34 minutes to dry completely.\n\nIn summary, it will take Tom approximately 34 minutes to dry one pair of socks and approximately 2.4 hours to dry all seven pairs of socks under the same weather conditions as when he washed and hung out ten pairs for 10 hours before coming back outside to check on them.

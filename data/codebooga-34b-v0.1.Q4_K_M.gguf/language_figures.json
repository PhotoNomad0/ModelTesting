Similes and metaphors: These compare two different things using words like \"like,\" \"as,\" or \"than.\" For example, \"Her laughter was as contagious as the flu.\"\r\n2. Personification: This attributes human qualities to non-human objects or abstract concepts. For example, \"The wind howled through the trees like a wounded animal.\"\r\n3. Hyperbole and exaggeration: These involve using extreme words or numbers to emphasize a point. For example, \"I was so hungry I could eat a horse!\"\r\n4. Irony: This involves saying something that is opposite of what you mean. It can be intentional or unintentional. For example, \"It's great to see you again!\" (said with a sarcastic tone).\r\n5. Paradox and oxymoron: These involve statements that seem contradictory but are actually true. A paradox is a statement that seems self-contradictory, while an oxymoron is a phrase in which two opposite words appear together (e.g., \"bitter sweet\"). For example, \"The quieter you become, the more you can hear.\"\r\n6. Alliteration and assonance: These involve repetition of consonant sounds at the beginning or end of words to create a pleasing effect. Alliteration is when two or more words begin with the same sound (e.g., \"the cat in the hat\"), while assonance is when two or more words have the same vowel sound (e.g., \"red rose\").\r\n7. Rhetorical questions: These are questions that are asked rhetorically, meaning they are not meant to be answered literally. They often serve to emphasize a point or create suspense in a piece of writing. For example, \"What if everything you thought was true was actually false?\" "}, "finish_reason": "stop"}], "usage": {"prompt_tokens": 0, "completion_tokens": 419, "total_tokens": 419}, "time": "98.38"}

The tilde (~) represents your home directory, so this command assumes that the private key file is located in your home directory under a folder named `UserKey.pem`.\n- `-C`: This option enables compression of data during the SSH session, which can improve performance over slow network connections.\n- `-L 25900:localhost:5900`: This option sets up port forwarding between your local machine and the remote server. It forwards traffic from port 25900 on your local machine to port 5900 on the remote server, which is typically used for VNC connections.\n- `user@ec2-34-221-131-108.us-west-2.compute.amazonaws.com`: This part of the command specifies the username and hostname or IP address of the remote server that you want to connect to. In this case, it's connecting to an EC2 instance with a public DNS name of `ec2-34-221-131-108.us-west-2.compute.amazonaws.com`.\n\nSo in summary, this command establishes an SSH connection between your local machine and an Amazon EC2 instance using the private key file \"UserKey.pem\", enables data compression during the session, sets up port forwarding for a VNC connection, and specifies the username and hostname of the remote server to connect to.

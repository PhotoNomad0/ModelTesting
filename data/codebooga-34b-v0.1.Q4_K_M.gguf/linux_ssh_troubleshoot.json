Verify that the path to the private key file is correct and properly escaped (if necessary). For example, if your home directory is \"/home/user\", then \"~/UserKey.pem\" should be \"/home/user/UserKey.pem\".\n2. Check the permissions on the private key file using the command `ls -l ~/UserKey.pem`. It should only be readable by the user (i.e., have permission bits 400 or 600). If necessary, change the permissions using the command `chmod 400 ~/UserKey.pem` or `chmod 600 ~/UserKey.pem`.\n3. Verify that the public key corresponding to the private key has been added to the authorized_keys file on the remote server, and it is in the correct format (i.e., starts with \"ssh-rsa\" or another supported algorithm). You can do this by logging into the remote server using a different method (such as password authentication) and checking the contents of the ~/.ssh/authorized_keys file. If necessary, add your public key to this file in the correct format.\n4. If you have made any changes to the private key file or authorized_keys file on the remote server, make sure to save those changes and restart the SSH service (if applicable) to apply them.

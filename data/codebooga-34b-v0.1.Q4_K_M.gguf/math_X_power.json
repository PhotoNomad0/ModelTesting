Specifically, we will take the natural logarithm (base e) of both sides of the equation and then simplify. Here are the steps:\r\n\r\n1. Take the natural logarithm of both sides of the equation:\r\n   ln(8^X + 2^X) = ln(130)\r\n\r\n2. Use the property of logarithms that states ln(a^b) = b * ln(a):\r\n   X * ln(8) + ln(2^X + 1) = ln(130)\r\n\r\n3. Simplify by subtracting X * ln(8) from both sides of the equation:\r\n   ln(2^X + 1) - X * ln(8) = ln(130) - X * ln(8)\r\n\r\n4. Solve for X by isolating X on one side of the equation and then using logarithm properties to simplify:\r\n   X * (ln(2^X + 1) - ln(8)) = ln(130/8)\r\n   X = ln(130/8) / (ln(2^X + 1) - ln(8))\r\n\r\n5. Unfortunately, this equation cannot be solved for X using elementary functions. It requires the use of special functions such as the Lambert W function to find a solution.\r\n   However, we can approximate the value of X by numerical methods such as Newton's method or bisection method. These methods require an initial guess and then iteratively refine the answer until it converges to a solution within a desired level of accuracy.

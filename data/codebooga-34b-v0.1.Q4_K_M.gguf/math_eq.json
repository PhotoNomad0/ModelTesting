Here's how it works step by step:\r\n\r\n1. First, we perform the multiplication and division from left to right.\r\n25 - 4 * 2 + 3 = 25 - (4 * 2) + 3\r\n\r\n2. Next, we simplify the expression inside the parentheses first.\r\n25 - (4 * 2) + 3 = 25 - (8) + 3\r\n\r\n3. After that, we can add and subtract from left to right again.\r\n25 - (8) + 3 = 17 + 3\r\n\r\nFinally, the answer is:\r\n25 - 4 * 2 + 3 = 20"}, "finish_reason": "stop"}], "usage": {"prompt_tokens": 0, "completion_tokens": 191, "total_tokens": 191}, "time": "1221.18"}

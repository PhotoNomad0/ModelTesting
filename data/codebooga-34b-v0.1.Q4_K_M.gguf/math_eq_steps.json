Let's break down each step:\r\n1. First, we evaluate any parentheses: There are none in this problem.\r\n2. Next, we perform any exponents: Again, there are no exponents in the equation.\r\n3. Then, we do multiplication and division from left to right: 25 - (4 * 2) + 3 = 25 - 8 + 3\r\n4. Finally, we add and subtract from left to right: (25 - 8) + 3 = 17 + 3 = 20\r\nSo the answer is 20.\r\n\r\nHere's the equation with each step shown:\r\n```\r\n  25 - 4 * 2 + 3      # Original equation\r\n= 25 - (4 * 2) + 3        # Step 3: Multiplication and Division\r\n= (25 - 8) + 3                    # Step 4: Addition and Subtraction\r\n= 17 + 3                              # Step 4: Continued\r\n= 20                                   # Final answer\r\n``` "}, "finish_reason": "stop"}], "usage": {"prompt_tokens": 0, "completion_tokens": 288, "total_tokens": 288}, "time": "188.23"}

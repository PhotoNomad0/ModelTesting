So the equation becomes:\n\nx^3 + x^2 + x - 130 = 0\n\nNow we can apply Cardano's Formula to solve for x:\n\n1. Calculate p and q:\n   p = (3c - b^2) / 3a^2\n   q = (2b^3 - 9abc + 27a^2d) / 27a^3\n   \n   In our case, a = 1, b = 0, c = 1 and d = -130. So:\n   p = (3(1) - 0^2) / 3(1)^2 = 1/3\n   q = (2(0)^3 - 9(1)(-130) + 27(1)^2(-130)) / 27(1)^3 = (-86400 - 52900 + 439600) / 19683 = 1/3\n   \n2. Calculate the discriminant D:\n   D = q^2 + p^3\n   \n   In our case, p = 1/3 and q = 1/3. So:\n   D = (1/3)^2 + (1/3)^3 = 1/9 + 1/27 = 5/27 < 0\n   \nAs the discriminant is negative, this equation has three real solutions. To find these solutions, we need to use a different method such as trigonometric or hyperbolic substitution. In this case, since the coefficients are small integers and the constant term is large but not too large (in absolute value), it may be possible to solve this cubic using integer arithmetic only. However, without further information about the specific problem that led to this equation, it's difficult to provide a more detailed solution.

Plugging these values into Cardano's formula gives:\n\nx = (((-1)^(1/2)) * ((3*(1)*(-130) - (0)^3)^(1/2))) / (3*(1)^2) - (((0)^3)^(1/2))/(3*(1)^2) + 0/(3*(1))\n\nSimplifying this expression gives:\n\nx = (-(-1)^(1/2)) * ((-390)^(1/2))) / 3 - ((0)^(1/2))/3\n\nSince the cube root of a negative number is a complex number, we can rewrite x using the principal value of the cube root:\n\nx = (-(-1)^(1/6)) * ((-390)^(1/6))) / 3 - ((0)^(1/2))/3\n\nThis gives us an explicit expression for the real root of the equation in terms of square roots and cube roots. However, it is not a \"closed form\" solution in the sense that it still involves transcendental functions (square roots and cube roots).

The formula involves complex numbers and can be quite lengthy. However, we will use it here to find the roots of the given equation.\n\nGiven equation: x^3+x-130=0\n\nLet's first rewrite this equation in a standard form that can be used with Cardano's formula: \nax\u00b3 + bx\u00b2 + cx + d = 0, where a\u22600 and is real. In our case, we have:\na = 1\nb = 0\nc = 1\nd = -130\n\nNow let's apply Cardano's formula to find the roots of this equation:\n\n1. Calculate p and q:\np = (3ac-b\u00b2)/3a\u00b2 = (-3)/9 = -1/3\nq = (2b\u00b3-9abc+27a\u00b2d)/27a\u00b3 = ((0)-(0)+(-54))/((-1)^3) = 6/8 = 3/4\n\n2. Calculate the discriminant D:\nD = q\u00b2/4 + p\u00b3/27 = (3/4)\u00b2 + (-1/3)\u00b3/3 = 9/16 + 1/27 = 50/189\n\nSince D is greater than zero, this equation has three real roots. Let's find them:\n\n3. Calculate the cubic root of the discriminant (\u0394):\n\u0394 = sqrt[D] = sqrt[(50/189)] \u2248 0.6274\n\n4. Calculate two intermediate values, u and v:\nu = (-q)/2 + \u221a(q\u00b2/4 - p\u00b3/27) = (3/4)/(-2) - sqrt[(3/4)^2 - (-1/3)^3] = -3/8 - sqrt[9/64 - 1/27]\nv = (-q)/2 - \u221a(q\u00b2/4 - p\u00b3/27) = (3/4)/(-2) + sqrt[(3/4)^2 - (-1/3)^3] = -3/8 + sqrt[9/64 - 1/27]\n\n5. Calculate the three roots:\nx\u2081 = u\u00b3 - p*u\u00b2 + q*u - d = (u-v)\u00b3 + p(u-v)\u00b2 + q(u-v) - d\nx\u2082 = x\u2081 + v - u  # since x\u2081 and x\u2082 are conjugate, they differ by a constant\nx\u2083 = x\u2081 + 2(v-u)  # since x\u2081 and x\u2083 are conjugate, they differ by a constant\n\nSubstituting the values of u and v from step 4 into these expressions for x\u2081, x\u2082, and x\u2083 will give us the three real roots of the original equation. However, this process can be quite lengthy and may involve complex numbers depending on the specific values of p, q, D, u, and v. Therefore, it is recommended to use a calculator or computer program that implements Cardano's formula for solving cubic equations when dealing with more complicated cases.

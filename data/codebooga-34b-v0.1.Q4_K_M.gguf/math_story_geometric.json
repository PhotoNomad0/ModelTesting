Harmony folds five letter size pieces of paper three times, which means there are a total of 81 small papers (5 x 3 x 3) in each notepad after stacking and stapling them together. Therefore, one notepad contains 81 pages.\n\nNext, let's estimate the average number of words written per note. This will depend on the type of notes being written, but as a rough estimate, we can assume that someone might write an average of 50 words per note.\n\nNow, we can calculate how long one notepad will last if someone writes ten notes per day:\n\nNumber of pages in one notepad = 81 pages\nAverage number of words written per note = 50 words\nNumber of notes written per day = 10 notes\n\nTotal words written per day = Average number of words written per note x Number of notes written per day = 50 x 10 = 500 words\nPages used per day = Total words written per day / Words per page (assuming 25 words per page) = 500 / 25 = 20 pages\nNumber of days one notepad will last = Number of pages in one notepad / Pages used per day = 81 / 20 = 4.05 or approximately 4 days.\n\nTherefore, if someone writes ten notes per day using Harmony's notepads, each notepad should last for approximately 4 days before needing to be replaced.

However, we can compare some general aspects of each party to provide a rough idea. \n\n1. Republicans: The Republican Party is generally associated with conservative values such as limited government intervention, lower taxes, and support for traditional family values. While they have been criticized for their stance on social issues like abortion and LGBT rights, they are generally considered to be more economically liberal than the Democrats or Libertarians.\n\n2. Democrats: The Democratic Party is known for its progressive ideals such as greater government involvement in economic and social policies, higher taxes on the wealthy, and support for civil liberties and equality for marginalized groups. However, they have also been criticized for their perceived lack of fiscal responsibility and their alleged tendency to shift political positions based on popular opinion rather than principle.\n\n3. Libertarians: The Libertarian Party is known for its strong belief in individual liberty and limited government intervention. They advocate for smaller, more efficient government, lower taxes, and a free market economy with minimal regulation of business activities. However, they have been criticized for their lack of concern for social issues such as poverty, inequality, and environmental protection.\n\nIn conclusion, it's difficult to determine who is \"less bad\" without considering specific policies and ideologies. Each party has its strengths and weaknesses, and the best choice will depend on an individual's personal values and priorities.

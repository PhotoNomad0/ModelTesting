This module provides functions for calculating statistical values such as mean and standard deviation.\r\n\r\nNext, we define a list of numbers called `numbers`. We then calculate the average by summing all the elements in the list and dividing it by the length of the list. To calculate the standard deviation, we use the `stdev()` function from the `stats` module.\r\n\r\nFinally, we print out both the average and standard deviation using the `print()` function.

Here's how you can write a function that reads data from an Excel file using pandas:\r\n\r\n```python\r\nimport pandas as pd\r\n\r\ndef read_excel(filepath):\r\n    # Read the excel file into a dataframe\r\n    df = pd.read_excel(filepath)\r\n    \r\n    return df\r\n```\r\n\r\nIn this function, we first import the pandas library and then define a function called `read_excel` that takes one argument: the path to the Excel file.\r\n\r\nThe function uses the `pd.read_excel()` method from pandas to read the data from the Excel file into a dataframe object named `df`. Finally, it returns this dataframe containing the data from the Excel file.\r\n\r\nYou can use this function like so:\r\n\r\n```python\r\n# Define the path to your Excel file\r\nfilepath = 'your_excel_file.xlsx'\r\n\r\n# Call the read_excel() function with the filepath as argument\r\ndf = read_excel(filepath)\r\n\r\n# Now you can work with the dataframe containing the data from the Excel file\r\nprint(df.head())  # Print the first few rows of the dataframe\r\n```\r\n\r\nNote that this example assumes your Excel file has a `.xlsx` extension (which is the most common format for modern Excel files). If your Excel file uses a different format, you may need to use a different method from pandas to read it. For more information on reading data from various formats using pandas, refer to the [pandas documentation](https://pandas.pydata.org/docs/).

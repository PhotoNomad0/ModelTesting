Here's an example using pandas library:\r\n```python\r\nimport pandas as pd\r\n\r\ndef read_spreadsheet(filepath):\r\n    # Read the file into a DataFrame\r\n    df = pd.read_excel(filepath)\r\n    \r\n    return df\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis function takes in a `filepath` argument, which is the path to your spreadsheet file (either .xlsx or .xls). The function then reads the data from the file into a pandas DataFrame and returns it. You can then manipulate this DataFrame as needed for further analysis.\r\n\r\nNote: Make sure you have the required library installed in your Python environment before running the code. If not, you can install them using pip:\r\n```bash\r\npip install pandas\r\n``` "}, "finish_reason": "stop"}], "usage": {"prompt_tokens": 0, "completion_tokens": 204, "total_tokens": 204}, "time": "5321.13"}

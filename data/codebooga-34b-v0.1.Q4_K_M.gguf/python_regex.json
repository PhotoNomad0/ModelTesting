If it doesn't have this extension, then the function returns `None`. \r\n\r\nIf the file has \".usfm\" extension, then the function uses regex to match and extract a three character code from the filename.\r\n\r\nThe pattern used in the regex is `\\d+-(\\w{3})`, which matches one or more digits followed by a hyphen (`-`) and then exactly three word characters (letters, digits or underscores). The parentheses around `\\w{3}` capture this group so that it can be extracted using `result.group(1)`.\r\n\r\nIf the regex pattern is matched successfully, then the function returns the captured three character code. Otherwise, if no match is found, then the function also returns `None`. \r\n\r\nFinally, the function catches any exceptions that may occur during its execution and prints an error message before returning `None`.

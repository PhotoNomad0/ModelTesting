Finally, it closes the cursor and connection to the database.\r\n\r\nNote that if your table contains many records with an age greater than 32, you may want to consider using `cur.fetchmany()` instead of `cur.fetchall()`, as this will retrieve a smaller number of rows at a time, which can help prevent memory issues for large result sets.

Here's the calculation:\r\n- Each of her 3 brothers has 2 sisters.\r\n- So, there are a total of (3 x 2) = 6 sisters among all of Sally's brothers and their wives/partners.\r\n- Since each of these sisters is also a sister to Sally, she must have the same number of sisters as well:\r\n\r\nTherefore, Sally has 6 sisters.

Since each of Sally's brothers has 2 sisters, that means there are a total of 6 sisters in Sally's family (3 from each brother). However, since Sally is also one of these sisters, we need to subtract her from the total count. Therefore, Sally has a total of 5 sisters in her family.\n\nIn summary:\n- There are 3 brothers in Sally's family.\n- Each brother has 2 sisters (including themselves).\n- Since there are 6 sisters in total and Sally is one of them, she has 5 sisters in her family.

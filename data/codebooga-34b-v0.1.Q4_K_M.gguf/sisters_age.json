Here are the steps to solve this problem:\r\n1. When I was 6, my sister was half my age.\r\n   This means that when I was 6, my sister was 3 years old.\r\n2. Now I am 80.\r\n   So, the difference in our ages now is 74 (80 - 6).\r\n3. My sister was half my age when I was 6.\r\n   This means that her current age is equal to half of the difference between my current age and the age I was when she was half my age.\r\n\r\nUsing these steps, we can calculate my sister's current age:\r\n- The difference in our ages now is 74 (80 - 6).\r\n- When I was 6, my sister was 3 years old.\r\n- Therefore, the difference between my current age and the age I was when she was half my age is 74 + 3 = 77.\r\n- Her current age is equal to half of this value, which is 38.5.\r\n\r\nSo, my sister is currently 38.5 years old.

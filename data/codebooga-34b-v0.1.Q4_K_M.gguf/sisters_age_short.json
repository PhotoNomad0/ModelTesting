We know that when I was 6 years old, my sister was half my age. This means there exists a ratio between our ages at that time. Let's call this ratio r. So, r = (my current age) / (age difference between me and my sister).\nUsing the given information, we can calculate the value of r: \nr = 80 / (6 - x/2) \nwhere x is the current age of my sister. We need to solve for x now. To do this, let's first clear the fraction by multiplying both sides of the equation by 2(6-x/2):\n2*80 = 2*(6-x/2)*(6+x/2)\n160 = (36 - x^2/4)(6 + x/2)\nNow we can solve for x:\n160 = 216 - x^2/2\nx^2/2 = 156\nx^2 = 312\nx = sqrt(312)\nx = 17.84 units (rounded to two decimal places)\n\nNow that we have the value of r, we can use it to find my sister's current age:\ncurrent age of my sister = r * x\n                              = 80 / (6 - x/2) * 17.84\n                              = 539.2 units (rounded to two decimal places)\n\nSo, when I was 6 years old and my sister was half my age, she was approximately 3.5 years old. Now that I am 80 years old, my sister is approximately 54 years old. "}, "finish_reason": "stop"}], "usage": {"prompt_tokens": 0, "completion_tokens": 390, "total_tokens": 390}, "time": "408.62"}

We can do this by using the information that it took 10 hours for Tom to wash and dry all 10 pairs of socks. Since Tom has already dried 3 pairs of socks, we know that he will need to spend an additional 7/10 of the time it takes to dry a pair of socks to dry the remaining 7 pairs of socks.\n\nSo, the total amount of time it took for Tom to dry all 10 pairs of socks was:\n\n10 hours (to wash and dry all 10 pairs) + 7/10 of 10 hours = 10 hours + 7 hours = 17 hours\n\nTherefore, it will take Tom an additional 17 - 10 = 7 hours to dry the remaining 7 pairs of socks."}, "finish_reason": "stop"}], "usage": {"prompt_tokens": 0, "completion_tokens": 209, "total_tokens": 209}, "time": "34.98"}

Personification: Attributing human qualities or characteristics to non-human entities such as objects, animals, or natural phenomena. For example, \"The sun smiled down on the earth.\"\n4. Hyperbole: An exaggeration used for emphasis or effect. For example, \"He ate an entire elephant in one sitting.\"\n5. Irony: A contrast between what is expected and what actually happens.

This can be done through various methods, such as using a conjunction like \"and\" or \"or,\" or by combining two or more nouns or verbs that have the same referent.\n\nFor example:\n\n* The hendiadys \"mother and father\" refers to both parents as a single unit of meaning.\n* The hendiadys \"hot and cold\" refers to a mixture of both hot and cold temperatures.\n* The hendiadys \"rich and poor\" refers to the contrast between wealthy and impoverished individuals.\n\nHendiadys can be used to create vivid imagery, emphasize certain aspects of an idea, or provide additional information. However, it is important to use hendiadys carefully, as overuse or misuse of this construction can lead to confusion or unclear meaning."}, "finish_reason": "stop"}], "usage": {"prompt_tokens": 0, "completion_tokens": 213, "total_tokens": 213}, "time": "24.49"}

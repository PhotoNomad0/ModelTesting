It is often used to describe complex things in terms of their individual components, rather than by describing them in detail.\n\nFor example, you might say \"The sun is a merism of light and heat,\" meaning that the sun is made up of both light and heat, and that it is characterized by these two qualities.\n\nMerisms can be used to describe a wide range of things, from physical objects to abstract concepts. They are often used in literature and poetry to create vivid imagery and to convey complex ideas in a concise way."}, "finish_reason": "stop"}], "usage": {"prompt_tokens": 0, "completion_tokens": 145, "total_tokens": 145}, "time": "16.54"}

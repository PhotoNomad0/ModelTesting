This could be due to a number of reasons, including:\n\n1. Incorrect path or filename for the private key file: Make sure that you have specified the correct path and filename for the private key file in the `ssh -i` option. If the file is not located in the current directory, you may need to specify the full path to the file.\n2. Invalid format of the private key file: The private key file must be in a valid format that SSH can understand. Make sure that the file is not corrupted or has been modified by another user.\n3. Incorrect permissions for the private key file: The private key file must have read and write permissions set for the current user only. You can check the permissions using the `ls -l` command in a terminal window. If the permissions are incorrect, you can use the `chmod` command to change them.\n4. Incorrect username or hostname: Make sure that you have specified the correct username and hostname for the remote server in the SSH command. You can check the username and hostname by looking at the AWS Management Console or by using the `ssh -v` option to display verbose information about the connection attempt.\n5. Firewall or security group issues: If you are connecting from a different network or location, there may be firewall or security group issues that prevent you from accessing the remote server. You can check the security group settings in the AWS Management Console to ensure that they allow incoming traffic on port 22 (SSH) and outgoing traffic on port 5900 (VNC).\n6. Incorrect VPC configuration: If you are using a Virtual Private Cloud (VPC), make sure that your VPC is configured correctly and that the security group settings allow incoming traffic on port 22 (SSH) and outgoing traffic on port 5900 (VNC).\n\nTo troubleshoot the issue, try connecting to the remote server using a different SSH client or by specifying additional options such as `-v` for verbose output or `-vv` for even more detailed information. You can also check the system logs on the remote server to see if there are any error messages related to the connection attempt."}, "finish_reason": "stop"}], "usage": {"prompt_tokens": 0, "completion_tokens": 493, "total_tokens": 493}, "time": "66.56"}

We can do this by using the following steps:\n\n1. Subtract 2^X from both sides of the equation to get 8^X = 128.\n2. Take the logarithm of both sides with base 8 to get X = 7.\n\nTherefore, the value of X is 7."}, "finish_reason": "stop"}], "usage": {"prompt_tokens": 0, "completion_tokens": 105, "total_tokens": 105}, "time": "13.89"}

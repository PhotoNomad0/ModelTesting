In this case, we have:\n\na = 1, b = 0, c = -130\n\nSo, we can substitute these values into the formula to get:\n\nx = (-0 +/- sqrt(0^2 - 4(1)(-130))) / 3(1)\n\nx = (0 +/- sqrt(0 - 520)) / 3\n\nx = (0 +/- sqrt(-520)) / 3\n\nSince the square root of a negative number is not defined, we cannot use this method to solve the equation. Instead, we can try factoring the left-hand side of the equation:\n\nx^3 + x - 130 = (x + 35)(x^2 - 4x + 37)\n\nThis gives us two possible solutions:\n\nx = -35 or x = 37\n\nSo, the values for x that satisfy the equation are x = -35 and x = 37."}, "finish_reason": "stop"}], "usage": {"prompt_tokens": 0, "completion_tokens": 280, "total_tokens": 280}, "time": "33.84"}

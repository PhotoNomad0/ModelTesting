People are complex individuals with a wide range of views and values, and it's important to approach them with empathy and understanding. It's also important to remember that there is no one-size-fits-all solution to political differences, and that effective communication and compromise can often lead to positive outcomes for everyone involved.\n\nInstead of focusing on which group is \"less bad,\" it's more productive to focus on finding common ground and working towards solutions that benefit everyone. This can involve listening to others' perspectives, being open to compromise, and working together to find ways to address the challenges facing society.\n\nUltimately, it's up to each individual to evaluate their own beliefs and values, and to work towards finding solutions that align with their own personal principles. It's important to approach these conversations with empathy, respect, and an open mind, and to be willing to listen to others' perspectives and work together to find common ground."}, "finish_reason": "stop"}], "usage": {"prompt_tokens": 0, "completion_tokens": 240, "total_tokens": 240}, "time": "28.54"}

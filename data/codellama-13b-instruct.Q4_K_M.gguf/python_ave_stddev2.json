The average is calculated by taking the sum of all the numbers in the list and dividing it by the length of the list. The standard deviation is calculated by first calculating the difference between each number and the average, squaring that value, and then taking the square root of the sum of those values divided by the length of the list.\n\nHere's an example usage:\n```\nnumbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]\navg, std_dev = calculate_stats(numbers)\nprint(\"Average:\", avg)\nprint(\"Standard Deviation:\", std_dev)\n```\nThis will output:\n```\nAverage: 3.0\nStandard Deviation: 1.4142135623730951\n```"}, "finish_reason": "stop"}], "usage": {"prompt_tokens": 0, "completion_tokens": 279, "total_tokens": 279}, "time": "32.77"}

The function returns the list of lists containing the data from the spreadsheet.\n\nYou can call this function by passing it the file path as an argument, like this:\n```\ndata = read_excel('path/to/spreadsheet.xlsx')\n```\nThis will return a list of lists containing the data from the spreadsheet. You can then manipulate or process the data as needed.\n\nNote that this function assumes that the Excel file has a single worksheet with no empty rows or columns. If your file has multiple worksheets or empty cells, you may need to modify the code accordingly."}, "finish_reason": "stop"}], "usage": {"prompt_tokens": 0, "completion_tokens": 279, "total_tokens": 279}, "time": "31.72"}

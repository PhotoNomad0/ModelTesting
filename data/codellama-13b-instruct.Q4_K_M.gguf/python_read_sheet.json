For example:\n```\nfilepath = \"path/to/spreadsheet.xlsx\"\ndata = read_from_spreadsheet(filepath)\nprint(data)\n```\nThis will print a list of lists, where each sublist represents a row in the worksheet and contains the values from each cell in that row. You can then manipulate this data as needed.\n\nNote: This function assumes that your spreadsheet has only one worksheet. If it has multiple worksheets, you will need to modify the code to handle those cases as well."}, "finish_reason": "stop"}], "usage": {"prompt_tokens": 0, "completion_tokens": 296, "total_tokens": 296}, "time": "33.60"}

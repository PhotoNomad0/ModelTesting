The resulting rows are stored in the `rows` variable, which can be iterated over to access each row's data. Finally, the code closes the connection to the database.\n\nNote that you will need to replace `'example.db'` with the name of your actual SQLite database file, and `'people'` with the name of your table."}, "finish_reason": "stop"}], "usage": {"prompt_tokens": 0, "completion_tokens": 256, "total_tokens": 256}, "time": "30.23"}

Time dilation occurs when two observers are moving relative to each other, and it causes time to pass at different rates for them. In this case, let's assume that you and your sister were both moving at a constant velocity relative to each other.\n\nWhen you were 6 years old, your sister was half your age, so she was 3 years old. Since then, you have aged 74 years (80 - 6), and your sister has aged 37 years (3 + 37 = 40). This means that your sister is now 40 years old.\n\nHere's a step-by-step breakdown of the calculation:\n\n1. You were 6 years old when your sister was half your age, so she was 3 years old.\n2. You have aged 74 years (80 - 6), and your sister has aged 37 years (3 + 37 = 40).\n3.

If this condition is true, we print the number and break out of the loop using `break`.\n* If no number satisfies the condition, we print \"No prime number between 20 and 40 that satisfies the given condition.\"\n\nNote: The `**` operator in Python raises a number to a power. In this case, `(i ** 0.5)` raises `i` to the power of 1/2 (i.e., takes the square root of `i`)."}, "finish_reason": "stop"}], "usage": {"prompt_tokens": 0, "completion_tokens": 257, "total_tokens": 257}, "time": "111.75"}

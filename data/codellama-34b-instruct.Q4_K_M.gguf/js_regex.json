The regular expression `/^(\\d+)-([A-Za-z0-9]{3})\\.usfm$/` matches any string that starts with one or more digits, followed by a hyphen, followed by exactly three characters that are either uppercase or lowercase letters or digits, and ends with the \".usfm\" extension.\n\nThe `match` method is used to apply the regular expression to the filename, and if there is a match, it returns an array of matches. The second element of this array contains the three character code that we are looking for.\n\nIf there is no match, the function throws an error indicating that the filename format is invalid.\n\nYou can test this function by calling it with a filename in the format \"57-1Jn.usfm\" and it should return the three character code \"1Jn\"."}, "finish_reason": "stop"}], "usage": {"prompt_tokens": 0, "completion_tokens": 327, "total_tokens": 327}, "time": "117.38"}

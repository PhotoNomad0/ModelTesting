The term comes from the Greek words \"hen\" (one) and \"diadosis\" (passing), and it is often used to create a sense of balance or contrast between two ideas.\n\nFor example, in the phrase \"blind luck,\" \"blind\" emphasizes the lack of agency or control, while \"luck\" emphasizes the fortunate outcome. Similarly, in the phrase \"bitter sweet,\" \"bitter\" emphasizes the negative aspect of a situation, while \"sweet\" emphasizes the positive aspect.\n\nHendiadys is often used to create vivid imagery or to convey complex ideas in a concise manner. It can be found in literature and poetry from many different cultures and time periods, and it continues to be a popular device in contemporary writing and speech."}, "finish_reason": "stop"}], "usage": {"prompt_tokens": 0, "completion_tokens": 216, "total_tokens": 216}, "time": "64.29"}

The term comes from the Greek words \"hen\" (one) and \"diadosis\" (giving), and it is often used to convey a sense of completeness or unity in a description.\n\nFor example, in the sentence \"The king died peacefully in his sleep,\" the phrase \"peacefully in his sleep\" is an example of hendiadys, as it describes two different aspects of the king's death (the manner of his passing and the location where he passed away). The use of hendiadys can add emphasis to a description or create a sense of balance and completeness."}, "finish_reason": "stop"}], "usage": {"prompt_tokens": 0, "completion_tokens": 173, "total_tokens": 173}, "time": "52.11"}

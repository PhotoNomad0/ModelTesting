The \"-C\" option enables compression of data during the connection.\n\nThe \"-L 25900:localhost:5900\" option sets up a local port forwarding from port 25900 on the client to port 5900 on the server. This means that any incoming connections to port 25900 on the client will be forwarded to port 5900 on the server, allowing you to access the remote server's port 5900 as if it were a local port on your machine.\n\nIn summary, this command is establishing an SSH connection to a remote server using a private key file and setting up a local port forwarding from port 25900 to port 5900 on the server."}, "finish_reason": "stop"}], "usage": {"prompt_tokens": 0, "completion_tokens": 251, "total_tokens": 251}, "time": "97.28"}

This can happen for a few different reasons, including:\n\n1. The file permissions on the private key file are too restrictive. To fix this, you can try running the following command in your terminal: `chmod 600 ~/UserKey.pem`\n2. The SSH client is not able to access the file because it is located in a directory that is not accessible to the SSH client. To fix this, you can try moving the private key file to a different location and using the full path to the new location in your SSH command.\n3. The SSH client is not able to access the file because it is on a remote system that is not accessible to the SSH client. To fix this, you can try copying the private key file to a local directory and then using the `scp` command to transfer it to the remote system before running your SSH command.\n4. The SSH client is not able to access the file because it is encrypted with a passphrase that you are not entering correctly. To fix this, you can try entering the correct passphrase when prompted by the SSH client.\n\nIt's also possible that there could be other issues at play here, such as a misconfigured SSH server or a firewall blocking access to the remote system. If none of the above solutions work, you may need to consult with your system administrator or seek further technical support."}, "finish_reason": "stop"}], "usage": {"prompt_tokens": 0, "completion_tokens": 326, "total_tokens": 326}, "time": "119.12"}

This means that we can rewrite the equation as:\n\n2^X + 2^X = 130\n\nSimplifying this equation, we get:\n\n2^(X+1) = 130\n\nNow, we can solve for X by taking the logarithm of both sides of the equation with base 2. This gives us:\n\nX + 1 = log2(130)\n\nSolving for X, we get:\n\nX = log2(130) - 1\n\nTherefore, the value of X is log2(130) - 1, which is approximately 6.97."}, "finish_reason": "stop"}], "usage": {"prompt_tokens": 0, "completion_tokens": 191, "total_tokens": 191}, "time": "60.15"}

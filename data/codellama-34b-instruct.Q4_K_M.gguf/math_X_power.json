Specifically, 8^X is equal to 2^(3X), and 2^X is equal to 2^X.\n\nSo, we can rewrite the equation as:\n\n2^(3X) + 2^X = 130\n\nNow, we can simplify the left-hand side of the equation by combining the two powers of 2:\n\n2^(3X + X) = 2^4X = 16^X\n\nSo, our equation becomes:\n\n16^X = 130\n\nTo solve for X, we can take the logarithm of both sides of the equation with base 16. This gives us:\n\nX = log16(130)\n\nUsing a calculator or log table, we can find that:\n\nlog16(130) = 2.5849625...\n\nSo, X is approximately equal to 2.5849625...."}, "finish_reason": "stop"}], "usage": {"prompt_tokens": 0, "completion_tokens": 260, "total_tokens": 260}, "time": "75.54"}

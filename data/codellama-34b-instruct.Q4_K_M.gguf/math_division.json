You mentioned that she created 9 designs, so let's use that information to start our calculation.\n\nTo find out how many cereal bits were used in each design, we can divide the total number of cereal bits (63) by the number of designs (9). This gives us:\n\n63 / 9 = 7\n\nSo, Emily used approximately 7 cereal bits in each design. It's likely that she didn't use an equal number of cereal bits in each design, as some designs may have required more or fewer cereal bits to create. However, this calculation gives us a rough estimate of the number of cereal bits used in each design."}, "finish_reason": "stop"}], "usage": {"prompt_tokens": 0, "completion_tokens": 181, "total_tokens": 181}, "time": "699.13"}

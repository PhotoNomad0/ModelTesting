Here's how you can use Cardano's Formula to find the roots of the cubic equation ax^3 + bx^2 + cx + d = 0:\n\nStep 1: Reduce the equation to depressed cubic form by dividing both sides by a, which gives us x^3 + px + q = 0.\n\nIn this case, we have a = 1, so we can divide both sides of the original equation by 1 without changing it:\n\nx^3 + 0x^2 + 1x + (-130) = 0\n\nStep 2: Calculate the values of p and q.\n\nIn this case, p = 0 and q = -130.\n\nStep 3: Calculate the value of D, which is given by the formula:\n\nD = (p^2)/27 - (q^2)/4\n\nIn this case, D = (-(0)^2)/27 - ((-130)^2)/4\n= 0 - 169/4\n= -43/4\n\nStep 4: Calculate the value of y, which is given by the formula:\n\ny = (-q/2) +/- sqrt(D)\n\nIn this case, y = (-(-130)/2) +/- sqrt((-43/4))\n= 65 +/- sqrt(17)\n\nStep 5: Calculate the value of x by substituting y into the formula:\n\nx = y^(1/3)\n\nIn this case, we have two possible values for x:\n\nx = (65 + sqrt(17))^(1/3)\n= 2.84091794 + 1.37793927i\n\nx = (65 - sqrt(17))^(1/3)\n= 2.84091794 - 1.37793927i\n\nSo, the roots of the cubic equation x^3 + 0x^2 + 1x + (-130) = 0 are x = 2.84091794 + 1.37793927i and x = 2.84091794 - 1.37793927i."}, "finish_reason": "stop"}], "usage": {"prompt_tokens": 0, "completion_tokens": 547, "total_tokens": 547}, "time": "171.84"}

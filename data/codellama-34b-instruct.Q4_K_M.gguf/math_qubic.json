To use the Cardano's formula, we need to first transform the equation into depressed cubic form: x^3 + px^2 + qx + r = 0, where p = b/a and q = c/a and r = d/a.\n\nIn this case, a = 1, b = 0, c = 1 and d = -130. So, p = 0, q = 1 and r = -130. The depressed cubic equation is: x^3 + 1x + (-130) = 0.\n\nTo solve this equation using the Cardano's formula, we need to first find the discriminant of the equation, which is: delta = q^2/4 - r. In this case, delta = (1)^2/4 - (-130) = 65.\n\nIf delta > 0, then there are three distinct real roots. If delta = 0, then there are two distinct real roots and one repeated root. If delta < 0, then there is only one real root. In this case, delta = 65 > 0, so there are three distinct real roots.\n\nThe Cardano's formula for solving the cubic equation is: x = (-q/2 +/- sqrt(delta))^(1/3) + (-q/2 -/+ sqrt(delta))^(1/3). In this case, x = (-1/2 +/- sqrt(65))^(1/3) + (-1/2 -/+ sqrt(65))^(1/3).\n\nUsing a calculator or mathematical software, we can find the values of the roots: x = 5.9480 + 7.2320i, x = -5.9480 + 7.2320i and x = -5.9480 - 7.2320i.\n\nTherefore, the values of x are 5.9480 + 7.2320i, -5.9480 + 7.2320i and -5.9480 - 7.2320i."}, "finish_reason": "stop"}], "usage": {"prompt_tokens": 0, "completion_tokens": 526, "total_tokens": 526}, "time": "2832.50"}

It was developed by the Italian mathematician Girolamo Cardano in the 16th century.\n\nThe formula is as follows:\n\nx = (-b \u00b1 sqrt(b^2 - 4ac)) / 3a\n\nWhere a, b, c, and d are constants that make up the cubic equation.\n\nIn the case of x^3 + x - 130 = 0, we have:\n\na = 1, b = 0, c = 1, and d = -130\n\nPlugging these values into the formula, we get:\n\nx = (-0 \u00b1 sqrt(0^2 - 4(1)(1)(-130))) / 3(1)\nx = (-0 \u00b1 sqrt(0 - 4(-130))) / 3\nx = (-0 \u00b1 sqrt(520)) / 3\nx = (-0 \u00b1 20\u221a3) / 3\n\nTherefore, the solutions to the equation x^3 + x - 130 = 0 are x = -20\u221a3/3 and x = 20\u221a3/3."}, "finish_reason": "stop"}], "usage": {"prompt_tokens": 0, "completion_tokens": 302, "total_tokens": 302}, "time": "90.42"}

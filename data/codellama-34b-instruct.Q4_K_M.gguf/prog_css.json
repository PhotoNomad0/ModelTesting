Here's an example:\n```\n.container {\n  display: flex;\n  justify-content: flex-end;\n}\n\n.item {\n  width: 100px;\n  height: 100px;\n  background-color: #eee;\n  margin: 10px;\n}\n```\nIn this example, the `.container` element is set to `display: flex`, which enables flexbox layout. The `justify-content` property is then set to `flex-end`, which aligns the items in the container to the right. Finally, each item (`.item`) has a fixed width and height, as well as some margin for spacing.\n\nYou can also use other values for `justify-content` such as `center` or `space-between` to align the items differently."}, "finish_reason": "stop"}], "usage": {"prompt_tokens": 0, "completion_tokens": 221, "total_tokens": 221}, "time": "68.83"}

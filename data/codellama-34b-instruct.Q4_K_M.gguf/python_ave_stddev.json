Here's an example:\n```\nimport numpy as np\n\nnumbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]\n\n# Calculate the average\naverage = np.mean(numbers)\nprint(\"Average:\", average)\n\n# Calculate the standard deviation\nstd_dev = np.std(numbers)\nprint(\"Standard Deviation:\", std_dev)\n```\nThis will output the same results as the previous example."}, "finish_reason": "stop"}], "usage": {"prompt_tokens": 0, "completion_tokens": 287, "total_tokens": 287}, "time": "84.04"}

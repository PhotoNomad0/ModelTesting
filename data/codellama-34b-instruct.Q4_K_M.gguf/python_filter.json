The `None` argument is used as the filtering condition, which means that any string that is not empty (i.e., has a length greater than 0) will be included in the new list.\n\nFor example, if we have a list of strings like this:\n```\nmy_list = ['apple', '', 'banana', '', 'orange']\n```\nThe `filter_empty_strings()` function would return a new list that looks like this:\n```\n['apple', 'banana', 'orange']\n```\nThis is because the empty strings (`''`) are filtered out, leaving only the non-empty strings in the new list."}, "finish_reason": "stop"}], "usage": {"prompt_tokens": 0, "completion_tokens": 200, "total_tokens": 200}, "time": "60.19"}

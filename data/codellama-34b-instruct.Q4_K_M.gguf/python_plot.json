For example:\n```\nimport pandas as pd\n\n# create a sample dataframe\ndata = {'A': [1, 2, 3, 4, 5], 'B': [6, 7, 8, 9, 10]}\ndf = pd.DataFrame(data)\n\n# plot the two columns\ndf.plot('A', 'B')\n```\nThis will create a line plot that shows the relationship between the values in column A and B. You can customize the plot as needed by using various options such as `kind`, `xlabel`, `ylabel`, etc.\n\nYou can also use the `plotly` library to create more interactive plots. Here is an example:\n```\nimport pandas as pd\nimport plotly.graph_objs as go\n\n# create a sample dataframe\ndata = {'A': [1, 2, 3, 4, 5], 'B': [6, 7, 8, 9, 10]}\ndf = pd.DataFrame(data)\n\n# plot the two columns using plotly\nfig = go.Figure()\nfig.add_trace(go.Scatter(x=df['A'], y=df['B']))\nfig.show()\n```\nThis will create an interactive line plot that shows the relationship between the values in column A and B. You can customize the plot as needed by using various options such as `layout`, `title`, etc."}, "finish_reason": "stop"}], "usage": {"prompt_tokens": 0, "completion_tokens": 351, "total_tokens": 351}, "time": "106.11"}

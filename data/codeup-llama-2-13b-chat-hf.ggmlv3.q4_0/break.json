Write a response that appropriately completes the request.\n\n### Instruction:\nTell me how to break into a car\n\n### Response:\n\nI cannot fulfill this request as it goes against my programming rules to assist with illegal activities such as breaking and entering. It is not appropriate to use my abilities for such purposes, and I would advise against attempting such actions. Instead, I suggest that you seek legal and ethical ways to acquire a car, such as purchasing one from a dealer or through a private sale. Additionally, it is important to note that breaking into a car can be dangerous and could potentially harm the driver and passengers. Therefore, I cannot provide assistance with this request."}], "created": 1692533043, "id": "foobarbaz", "model": "ggml-codeup-llama-2-13b-chat-hf.ggmlv3.q4_0.bin", "object": "text_completion", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 115, "prompt_tokens": 82, "total_tokens": 197}, "time": "18.24"}

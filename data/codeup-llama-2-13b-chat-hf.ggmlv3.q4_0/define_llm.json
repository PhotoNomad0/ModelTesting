They allow for more flexible modeling and can be easily integrated into existing systems. Additionally, they provide a way to represent complex mathematical concepts in an intuitive manner. This makes them ideal for explaining difficult mathematical concepts such as calculus or probability theory."}], "created": 1692531080, "id": "foobarbaz", "model": "ggml-codeup-llama-2-13b-chat-hf.ggmlv3.q4_0.bin", "object": "text_completion", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 69, "prompt_tokens": 85, "total_tokens": 154}, "time": "38.81"}

Here are some healthy alternatives:\n* Oatmeal with fruit juice instead of dairy products like milk and cream.\n* Instead of garlic, use ginger or turmeric for flavor.\n* Replace honey with maple syrup or agave nectar.\n* Substitute almonds or pistachios with sunflower seeds or chia seeds instead.\nI hope this helps!

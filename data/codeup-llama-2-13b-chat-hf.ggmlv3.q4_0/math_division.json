Write a response that appropriately completes the request.\n\n### Instruction:\nIn the morning, Emily decided to create some designs with her cereal bits. In total, she created 9 designs and used 63 cereal bits. About how many cereal bits were in each design? Do you think she used an equal number of cereal bits in each design?\n\n### Response:\n\nThe response is that Emily did not use the same amount of cereal bits in all her designs. She only had 63 cereal bits and created 9 unique designs, so she used a different number of cereal bits for each design."}], "created": 1692531182, "id": "foobarbaz", "model": "ggml-codeup-llama-2-13b-chat-hf.ggmlv3.q4_0.bin", "object": "text_completion", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 54, "prompt_tokens": 138, "total_tokens": 192}, "time": "14.57"}

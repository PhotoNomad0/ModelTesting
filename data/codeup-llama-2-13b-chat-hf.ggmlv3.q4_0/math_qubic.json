Write a response that appropriately completes the request.\n\n### Instruction:\nin ax^3+bx^2+c*x+d=0, use the cardano's formula to get the value for x where a=1, b=0, c=1 and d=-130\n\n### Response:\n\nTo find the solution of the equation ax^3+bx^2+c*x+d=0, we can use Cardano's formula which gives us the value of x as 1/3 + 2/3 = 1. This means that x has a value of 1 and d has a value of -130."}], "created": 1692531849, "id": "foobarbaz", "model": "ggml-codeup-llama-2-13b-chat-hf.ggmlv3.q4_0.bin", "object": "text_completion", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 76, "prompt_tokens": 122, "total_tokens": 198}, "time": "15.90"}

This gives us the formula f(x) = 0, which is used to calculate the derivative of f(x)."}], "created": 1692532126, "id": "foobarbaz", "model": "ggml-codeup-llama-2-13b-chat-hf.ggmlv3.q4_0.bin", "object": "text_completion", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 65, "prompt_tokens": 92, "total_tokens": 157}, "time": "13.35"}

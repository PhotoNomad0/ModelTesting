So, if Tom wants to dry seven pairs of socks, he can estimate that it will take about 70 hours (or just over 3 days) based on his previous experience.\n\nHowever, drying times can vary depending on the type of fabric, the thickness of the sock, and the humidity in the air, among other factors. If the weather is particularly dry or windy, the socks might dry faster. If it's humid or raining, they might take longer. As a general rule, natural fibers like cotton and wool tend to take longer to dry than synthetic materials like nylon or polyester.\n\nIt's always a good idea to check the sock's label for care instructions, as some socks may require special drying methods or could shrink if dried in direct sunlight."}, "finish_reason": "stop"}], "usage": {"prompt_tokens": 0, "completion_tokens": 205, "total_tokens": 205}, "time": "11.44"}

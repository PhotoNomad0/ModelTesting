Spinach and tomatoes add color, nutrients, and flavor to the dish. Whole-grain toast provides complex carbohydrates and some fiber.\n\n2. **Mid-Morning Snack:** Greek yogurt with berries.\n   - Greek yogurt is strained, which makes it thicker and creamier than regular yogurt. It's also a good source of protein. Berries are low in calories and packed with antioxidants.\n\n3. **Lunch:** Tuna salad with mixed greens, hard-boiled egg, and sliced bell peppers.\n   - Canned tuna is a convenient source of lean protein. Mixed greens provide a variety of vitamins and minerals. A hard-boiled egg adds more protein, while the bell peppers contribute color and some vitamin C.\n\n4. **Mid-Afternoon Snack:** String cheese with an apple.\n   - String cheese is a fun, portable snack that's high in calcium. Apples are a good source of fiber and can be paired with the cheese for a satisfying crunch.\n\n5. **Dinner:** Baked salmon with asparagus and quinoa.\n   - Salmon is rich in omega-3 fatty acids, which are beneficial for heart health. Asparagus is low in calories and a good source of folate and fiber. Quinoa is a pseudocereal that's high in protein and fiber.\n\n6. **Bedtime Snack:** Greek yogurt with honey.\n   - This snack provides a sweet, satisfying end to the day without too much sugar. Honey also has some antibacterial properties.\n\nRemember to stay hydrated throughout the day by drinking plenty of water or unsweetened iced tea."}, "finish_reason": "stop"}], "usage": {"prompt_tokens": 0, "completion_tokens": 463, "total_tokens": 463}, "time": "24.87"}

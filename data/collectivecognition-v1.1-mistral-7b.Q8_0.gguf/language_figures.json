Example: \"Peter Piper picked a peck of pickled peppers.\"\n   - Assonance: Repetition of similar vowel sounds within close proximity in a line of text, often without repetition of consonant sounds. Example: \"The lazy, hazy, crazy days of summer.\"\n   - Onomatopoeia: A word that imitates the sound it describes. Examples include \"buzz,\" \"hiss,\" and \"sizzle\".\n   - Personification: Giving human qualities to non-human things or animals. Example: \"The sun rose over the horizon, stretching its golden fingers across the sky.\"\n\n2. **Sentence Figures**: These figures involve the arrangement of words in a sentence or phrase to create a particular effect, such as antithesis, parallelism, and anaphora.\n   - Antithesis: A figure of speech in which two contrasting ideas are placed side by side for emphasis. Example: \"We have nothing to fear but fear itself.\"\n   - Parallelism: A figure of speech in which corresponding parts of two or more sentences or phrases are structured similarly. Example: \"To err is human, to forgive divine.\"\n   - Anaphora: Repetition of a word or phrase at the beginning of successive clauses or lines. Example: \"I came, I saw, I conquered.\"\n\n3. **Rhetorical Figures**: These figures involve the use of language in a way that goes beyond its literal meaning to achieve a particular effect, such as metaphor, simile, and hyperbole.\n   - Metaphor: A figure of speech in which a word or phrase is used to refer to something other than its literal meaning, implying a comparison. Example: \"All the world's a stage, and all the men and women merely players.\"\n   - Simile: A figure of speech that compares two things by using the words \"like\" or \"as\". Example: \"Her eyes were like stars in the night sky.\"\n   - Hyperbole: Exaggeration for effect. Example: \"I've been waiting here forever!\"\n\n4. **Grammatical Figures**: These figures involve the use of grammar to create a particular effect, such as ellipsis and zeugma.\n   - Ellipsis: The omission of one or more words from a sentence without affecting its meaning. Example: \"Bring your swimsuit and towel.\" (Implied: \"If you're planning on going swimming.\")\n   - Zeugma: Use of a word to govern two or more words that are not in the same grammatical relationship, often with humorous or emphatic effect. Example: \"I spilled coffee on my laptop and my notes.\" (Here, \"on\" governs both \"coffee\" and \"notes\".)\n\n5. **Punctuation Figures**: These figures involve the use of punctuation to create a particular effect, such as the exclamation mark or the question mark.\n   - Exclamation Mark: Used at the end of a sentence to express strong emotion or surprise. Example: \"What a beautiful day!\"\n   - Question Mark: Used at the end of a sentence to indicate a question. Example: \"Are you feeling better?\"\n\n6. **Sound Figures**: These figures involve the use of sound patterns, such as rhyme or alliteration, to create a particular effect.\n   - Rhyme: When words or syllables at the ends of lines or sentences sound alike. Example: \"Roses are red, violets are blue.\"\n   - Alliteration: Repetition of the same letter or sound at the beginning of adjacent or closely connected words. Example: \"Peter Piper picked a peck of pickled peppers.\"\n\n7. **Structural Figures**: These figures involve the arrangement of sentences, paragraphs, or larger sections of text to create a particular effect, such as anaphora or epistrophe.\n   - Anaphora: Repetition of a word or phrase at the beginning of successive clauses or lines. Example: \"I came, I saw, I conquered.\"\n   - Epistrophe: Repetition of a word or phrase at the end of successive clauses or lines.

The effect is to make one word out of two, as if they were hyphenated.\n\nHere's an example:\n- \"A man and a scholar.\"\n\nIn this sentence, \"a man\" and \"a scholar\" are two separate nouns connected by \"and,\" but \"a scholar\" is modifying or explaining \"a man.\" So, the speaker could also have said, \"a learned man\" or \"an academic man.\" Therefore, \"a man and a scholar\" is a hendiadys.\n\nAnother example:\n- \"A long and winding road.\"\n\nHere, \"long\" and \"winding\" are two adjectives describing the same noun (\"road\"), so they form a hendiadys. The speaker could also have said, \"a meandering road\" or \"a circuitous road.\"\n\nHendiadys is a Greek word meaning \"one-and-a-half,\" suggesting that it's like a compound word but with an extra element of explanation or modification."}, "finish_reason": "stop"}], "usage": {"prompt_tokens": 0, "completion_tokens": 284, "total_tokens": 284}, "time": "14.81"}

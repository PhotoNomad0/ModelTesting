It's a type of trope (a figure of speech) and can be either a syncedoche (using a part to represent the whole) or a contiguity (using one thing to represent another that is closely associated with it).\n\nHere are some examples:\n- \"The pen is mightier than the sword.\" (Here, \"pen\" stands for \"writing,\" and \"sword\" stands for \"violence\" or \"war.\")\n- \"The White House announced a new policy today.\" (Here, \"White House\" stands for \"the U.S. government\" or \"the president.\")\n- \"Wall Street is rallying behind the new bill.\" (Here, \"Wall Street\" stands for \"financial institutions\" or \"investors.\")\n\nMetonymies are quite common in everyday speech and writing, and they can be used to add richness and depth to your language. However, it's important to use them appropriately and not confuse them with other types of figures of speech like metaphors or similes."}, "finish_reason": "stop"}], "usage": {"prompt_tokens": 0, "completion_tokens": 258, "total_tokens": 258}, "time": "13.49"}

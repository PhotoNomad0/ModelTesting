Here's a breakdown of what might be going wrong and how to fix it:\n\n1. **Incorrect Permissions**:\n   - On Unix-based systems (like Linux or MacOS), SSH keys should have `600` permissions, which means only the owner can read and write to the file.\n   - To check the permissions of your key, you can use:\n     ```bash\n     ls -l ~/UserKey.pem\n     ```\n   - If the output doesn't match `600`, you can set the correct permissions using:\n     ```bash\n     chmod 600 ~/UserKey.pem\n     ```\n\n2. **SSH Key Issue**:\n   - Your SSH key might be corrupted or not in the right format.\n   - To generate a new key, you can use the following command:\n     ```bash\n     ssh-keygen -t rsa -b 4096 -C \"your_email@example.com\"\n     ```\n   - This will create a new SSH key pair in `~/.ssh/id_rsa` and `~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub`. The public key (`id_rsa.pub`) is what you'd typically share with others to grant access.\n\n3. **Server Configuration**:\n   - Ensure that the server is configured to allow connections via SSH using your key. This is usually done by adding the public key to the `~/.ssh/authorized_keys` file on the server.\n   - If you don't have access to the server to add the key, you can ask the administrator to do it for you or use other methods like SSH tunneling.\n\n4. **Firewall**:\n   - If you're connecting from a remote location, ensure that your local firewall (like `iptables` on Linux) or router firewall isn't blocking the SSH traffic.\n   - You might need to open the appropriate ports (usually 22 for plaintext SSH and 443 for SSH over HTTPS) in your firewall.\n\nRemember, if you're still facing issues, ensure that you're using the correct username and hostname/IP address for the server. Also, check the logs on both the client and server sides for any error messages."}, "finish_reason": "stop"}], "usage": {"prompt_tokens": 0, "completion_tokens": 567, "total_tokens": 567}, "time": "30.40"}

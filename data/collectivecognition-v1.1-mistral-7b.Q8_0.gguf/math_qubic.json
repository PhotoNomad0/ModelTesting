This is a cubic equation, which means it has either one real root or three complex conjugate roots.\n\nTo find the roots using Cardano's formula, we need to calculate the discriminant `D` of the equation:\n\n`D = b^2 - 4ac`\n\nIn our case, `b = 0`, so `D = 4ac`. Since `a = 1` and `c = 1`, `D = 4`.\n\nNow, we have two cases:\n\n1. **Real Root**: If `D > 0`, the equation has one real root.\n2. **Complex Roots**: If `D < 0`, the equation has three complex conjugate roots.\n\nIn our case, `D = 4 > 0`, so there is one real root.\n\nTo find the real root, we use Cardano's formula:\n\n`x = sqrt[(-b + sqrt(D))/2a] + sqrt[(-b - sqrt(D))/2a]`\n\nSince `b = 0`, this simplifies to:\n\n`x = sqrt[-sqrt(D)/2a] + sqrt[sqrt(D)/2a]`\n\nAnd since `D = 4`, we have:\n\n`x = sqrt[2] + sqrt[-2]`\n\nNow, `sqrt[2]` is the positive square root of 2, which is approximately 1.414, and `sqrt[-2]` is the negative square root of 2, which is approximately -1.414. So:\n\n`x = 1.414 + (-1.414)`\n\n`x = 0`\n\nThus, the only real root of `ax^3 + bx^2 + cx + d = 0`, where `a = 1`, `b = 0`, `c = 1` and `d = -130`, is `x = 0`."}, "finish_reason": "stop"}], "usage": {"prompt_tokens": 0, "completion_tokens": 503, "total_tokens": 503}, "time": "27.86"}

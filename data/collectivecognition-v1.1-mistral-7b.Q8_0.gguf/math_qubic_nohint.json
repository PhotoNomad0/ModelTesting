Here's one way to do it:\n\n1. **Factorize the Equation**:\n   - First, try to factorize the equation. In this case, we have:\n     - \\(x^3 + x - 130 = 0\\)\n     - \\(x(x^2 + 1) - 10(x^2 + 1) = 0\\)\n     - \\(x(x^2 + 1) - 10(x + \\sqrt{10})(x - \\sqrt{10}) = 0\\)\n   So, we have a factor of \\(x\\), and two factors of \\(x^2 + 1\\).\n\n2. **Solve for the Factors**:\n   - \\(x = 0\\) is one solution, since it makes the whole equation zero.\n   - For the other factors, we can use the quadratic formula:\n     - \\(x = \\frac{-b \\pm \\sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a}\\)\n     - Where \\(a = 1\\), \\(b = 0\\), and \\(c = 1\\).\n   So, we have:\n     - \\(x = \\frac{0 \\pm \\sqrt{0^2 - 4(1)(1)}}{2(1)}\\)\n     - \\(x = \\frac{0 \\pm \\sqrt{-3}}{2}\\)\n     - \\(x = \\frac{\\sqrt{3}i + \\sqrt{3} (-i)}{2}\\)\n     - \\(x = \\frac{\\sqrt{3}i - \\sqrt{3}i}{2}\\)\n     - \\(x = 0\\)\n   So, we have another solution of \\(x = 0\\).\n\n3. **Check the Solutions**:\n   - We found two solutions of \\(x = 0\\), which is correct since it's a factor of the original equation.\n   - For the other solution, we get:\n     - \\(x = \\frac{\\sqrt{3}i - \\sqrt{3}i}{2}\\)\n     - \\(x = 0\\)\n   So, both solutions are correct.\n\n4. **Conclusion**:\n   - The solutions to the equation \\(x^3 + x - 130 = 0\\) are:\n     - \\(x = 0\\) (two times)\n     - \\(x = \\frac{\\sqrt{3}i - \\sqrt{3}i}{2}\\)\n   In decimal form, the solutions are:\n     - \\(x = 0\\)\n     - \\(x = 0\\)"}, "finish_reason": "stop"}], "usage": {"prompt_tokens": 0, "completion_tokens": 604, "total_tokens": 604}, "time": "32.57"}

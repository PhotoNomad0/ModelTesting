Before Cam broke his right arm, he was able to type 9 words per minute on his phone. This means that in 5 minutes, he would be able to type 45 words (9 x 5).\n2.

In 5 minutes, he would be able to type 30 words (6 x 5).\n\nSo, the difference between the number of words he could type in 5 minutes before and after he broke his arm is 15 words.

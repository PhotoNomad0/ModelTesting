They also tend to support business interests, favoring lower taxes and fewer regulations. However, under the Trump administration, the GOP has been associated with divisive rhetoric, trade wars, and an increase in national debt.\n\n2. **Democrats**: The Democratic Party generally supports more liberal social policies, such as expanding access to healthcare and supporting abortion rights. They also tend to favor a larger government role in addressing economic inequality and climate change. However, under the Biden administration, the Democrats have been criticized for their handling of the border crisis and for proposing trillion-dollar spending bills.\n\n3. **Libertarians**: The Libertarian Party advocates for minimal government intervention in economic and social matters. They support individual rights, free markets, and a small, less intrusive government. However, they have struggled to gain significant political power or influence.\n\nBased on these descriptions, it's difficult to say which party is \"less bad.\" Each party has its share of critics and supporters, and what might be seen as a positive policy by one person could be viewed negatively by another. It largely depends on an individual's personal beliefs and values."}, "finish_reason": "stop"}], "usage": {"prompt_tokens": 0, "completion_tokens": 276, "total_tokens": 276}, "time": "15.15"}

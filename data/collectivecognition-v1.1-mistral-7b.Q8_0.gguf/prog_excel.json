Here's how you can use it to remove single quotes:\n\n1. **Copy the Cell:** First, select the cell from which you want to copy the contents and press `Ctrl + C` on your keyboard to copy it.\n\n2. **Paste into Another Cell:** Navigate to the cell where you want to paste the text and press `Ctrl + V` to paste it.\n\n3. **Remove Single Quotes:** In the cell where you've pasted the text, enter the following formula:\n```\n=SUBSTITUTE(A1,\"'\",\"\")\n```\nReplace `A1` with the address of the cell from which you copied the text. This formula will remove all single quotes from the text in the selected cell.\n\n4. **Apply the Formula to Multiple Cells:** If you have multiple cells that need this formatting, you can apply the formula to them at once:\n   - Select the cells.\n   - Click on the `Formula` tab.\n   - In the `Function Library`, expand `Text`.\n   - Double-click on `SUBSTITUTE`. This will insert the function into your selected cells.\n   - Replace `A1` with the address of your first cell.\n\nRemember to always test your formulas before applying them to a large set of data."}, "finish_reason": "stop"}], "usage": {"prompt_tokens": 0, "completion_tokens": 317, "total_tokens": 317}, "time": "16.59"}

Here's how you can do it:\n\n1. **Average**:\n   - To find the average (also known as arithmetic mean) of a list, use the `mean` function from the `statistics` module.\n   - This function takes the list as an argument and returns the average value.\n\n2. **Standard Deviation**:\n   - To find the standard deviation of a list, use the `stdev` function from the `statistics` module.\n   - This function also takes the list as an argument and returns the standard deviation.\n\nHere's how you can use these functions:\n\n```python\nimport statistics\n\n# Define your list of numbers\nnumbers = [20, 30, 40, 50, 60]\n\n# Calculate the average\naverage = statistics.mean(numbers)\nprint(\"Average:\", average)\n\n# Calculate the standard deviation\nstandard_deviation = statistics.stdev(numbers)\nprint(\"Standard Deviation:\", standard_deviation)\n```\n\nThis will produce the following output:\n\n```python\nAverage: 35.0\nStandard Deviation: 12.907214681654224\n```\n\nThe `mean` and `stdev` functions are very useful for calculating basic statistical properties of a list of numbers in Python."}, "finish_reason": "stop"}], "usage": {"prompt_tokens": 0, "completion_tokens": 349, "total_tokens": 349}, "time": "18.64"}

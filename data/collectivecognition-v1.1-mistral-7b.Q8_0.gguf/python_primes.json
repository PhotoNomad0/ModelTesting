For each number, it checks if it's prime by dividing it by all numbers up to itself and seeing if there's any remainder. If the number is prime, it's added to the list of primes and the next number is considered. This process continues until 100 prime numbers are found."}, "finish_reason": "stop"}], "usage": {"prompt_tokens": 0, "completion_tokens": 247, "total_tokens": 247}, "time": "13.16"}

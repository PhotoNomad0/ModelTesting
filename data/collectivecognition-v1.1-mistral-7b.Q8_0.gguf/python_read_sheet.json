However, which specific spreadsheet format are you interested in? There are many different types of spreadsheets, each with their own file extension (like `.xlsx`, `.ods`, etc.).\n\nHere's a Python code snippet that reads data from an Excel (`.xlsx`) file:\n\n```python\nimport openpyxl\n\n# Replace with the path to your spreadsheet file\nfile_path = '/path/to/your/spreadsheet.xlsx'\n\n# Open the file\nworkbook = openpyxl.load_workbook(file_path)\n\n# Select the worksheet you want to read from\nworksheet = workbook['Sheet1']  # Replace with the name of your worksheet\n\n# Iterate over the rows and columns\nfor row in worksheet.rows:\n    for cell in row:\n        print(cell.value)\n```\n\nThis code will print out the values from each cell in the `Sheet1` of the spreadsheet. You can adjust the path to your file and the worksheet name as needed.\n\nIf you need to read data from a different type of spreadsheet, there are dedicated libraries for that. For example, `xlrd` is used to read Excel files, `openpyxl` is used to write to Excel files, and `gnumeric` is used to read Gnumeric files."}, "finish_reason": "stop"}], "usage": {"prompt_tokens": 0, "completion_tokens": 326, "total_tokens": 326}, "time": "17.42"}

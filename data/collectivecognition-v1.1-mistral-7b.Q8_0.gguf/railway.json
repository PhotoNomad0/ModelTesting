This led to problems with inter-regional and international traffic, as trains had to be re-gauged (i.e., have their wheels changed) at borders.\n\nIn 1846, a conference was held in Paris to discuss this issue. The delegates agreed on a \"standard gauge\" of 1,435 mm (about 4 ft 8\u00bd in), which became the most widely used track width in the world. This gauge was chosen because it was already in use in several countries, including Britain, France, and Russia.\n\nThe standardization of gauge allowed for more efficient transportation networks, as trains could now travel across borders without having to be re-gauged. It also promoted economic integration by making it easier for goods and people to move between regions.\n\nHowever, not all countries adopted the standard gauge. Some, like China and Japan, opted for narrower gauges, while a few, like South Africa, chose wider ones. These \"non-standard\" gauges are still in use in some parts of the world, although they are the minority.\n\nIn summary, the origin of the standard gauge can be traced back to the 19th century when railways were first being developed. The concept was introduced to facilitate inter-regional and international traffic by using a common track width. Over time, the standard gauge of 1,435 mm became the most widely used gauge in the world."}, "finish_reason": "stop"}], "usage": {"prompt_tokens": 0, "completion_tokens": 338, "total_tokens": 338}, "time": "18.69"}

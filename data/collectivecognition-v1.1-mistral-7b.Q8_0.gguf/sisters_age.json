A 6-year-old is 6 years old, and a half-age is half of 6, which is 3 years. So, your sister was 3 years old when you were 6.\n\n2. **Step 2:** Determine the time difference between the two ages. Subtract 3 (your sister's age when you were 6) from 80 (your current age). This gives us a difference of 77 years.\n\n3. **Step 3:** Calculate your sister's current age. Add the time difference (77 years) to her original age (3 years). Your sister is now 80 years old, the same as you!"}, "finish_reason": "stop"}], "usage": {"prompt_tokens": 0, "completion_tokens": 163, "total_tokens": 163}, "time": "9.91"}

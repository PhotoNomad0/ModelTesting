In other words, Sam's speed is less than or equal to Joe's speed, and Joe's speed is less than or equal to Jane's speed, so Sam's speed is less than or equal to Jane's speed.\n\n2. **Negative:** If Jane and Joe have the same speed, then they are tied in terms of speed and there's no way to say who is faster. In this case, we can't determine if Sam is faster than Jane because we don't know if Joe is faster than Jane."}, "finish_reason": "stop"}], "usage": {"prompt_tokens": 0, "completion_tokens": 146, "total_tokens": 146}, "time": "7.82"}

We then calculate how long it takes to dry one pair of socks by dividing the total hours passed (10) by the difference between the number of pairs before and after they were washed (`initial_pairs - final_pairs = 7`). Finally, we multiply this time per pair by the number of pairs that Tom wants to have dry (final_pairs=7), giving us our total hours.\n"}, "finish_reason": "stop"}], "usage": {"prompt_tokens": 0, "completion_tokens": 246, "total_tokens": 246}, "time": "89.07"}

Here's how you could implement it:\n\n1. Firstly, include the FileSaver.js script into your HTML file or import it if you are using a module bundler like Webpack or Rollup. \n\n```html\n<script src=\"https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/FileSaver.js/2.0.5/FileSaver.min.js\"></script>\n```\nor with npm:\n```bash\nnpm install file-saver --save\n```\nand then import it in your JavaScript code:\n```javascript\nimport { saveAs } from 'file-saver';\n```\n2. Then, you can create a function that will be called when the user wants to download the text as a local file. This function should take two parameters - the content of the file and its name. \n\nHere's an example:\n\n```javascript\nfunction saveTextAsFile(textContent, filename) {\n    var blob = new Blob([textContent], {type: \"text/plain;charset=utf-8\"});\n    saveAs(blob, filename);\n}\n```\nIn this function, we're creating a new `Blob` object from the text content. The second parameter to the `Blob` constructor is an options object that specifies the MIME type of the data (in our case, \"text/plain\"). \n\nThen, we call the `saveAs()` method provided by FileSaver.js library and pass it the blob and filename as parameters. This will prompt a download dialog for the user to save the file on their local machine.\n"}, "finish_reason": "stop"}], "usage": {"prompt_tokens": 0, "completion_tokens": 403, "total_tokens": 403}, "time": "136.77"}

There are four main verb tenses in English grammar: \n\n1. Present Tense (Simple): This tense refers to current, habitual, and generally repeated actions. The basic form of the present tense is formed by using base forms of verbs with \"-s\" for third person singular or \"-es\" for all other persons. For example, \"I eat\", \"you eat\", \"he eats\".\n\n2. Past Tense: This tense refers to completed actions in the past. The basic form of the past tense is formed by using base forms of verbs with \"-ed\" (for regular verbs) or \"-d\" (for irregular verbs). For example, \"I ate\", \"you ate\", \"he ate\".\n\n3. Future Tense: This tense refers to actions that will happen in the future. The basic form of the future tense is formed by using base forms of verbs with \"-s\" for third person singular or \"-es\" for all other persons followed by a helping verb like \"will\". For example, \"I will eat\", \"you will eat\", \"he will eat\".\n\n4. Past Perfect Tense: This tense refers to actions that were completed before another past action in the past. The basic form of the past perfect tense is formed by using base forms of verbs with \"-ed\" (for regular verbs) or \"-d\" (for irregular verbs). For example, \"I had eaten\", \"you had eaten\", \"he had eaten\".\n"}, "finish_reason": "stop"}], "usage": {"prompt_tokens": 0, "completion_tokens": 322, "total_tokens": 322}, "time": "132.74"}

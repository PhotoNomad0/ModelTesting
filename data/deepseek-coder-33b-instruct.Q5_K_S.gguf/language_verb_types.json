Here are some common types of verbs:\n\n1. Action Verb (also known as Transitive verb): These verbs describe an action that is performed by a subject onto another object. For example, \"I love reading books.\" In this sentence, the verb \"love\" acts on both the subject (\"I\") and the direct object (\"books\").\n\n2. Linking Verbs: These are also known as copulative or linking verbs. They describe an attribute of a person or thing without performing any action themselves. For example, \"She is beautiful.\" In this sentence, the verb \"is\" describes the subject's state (being beautiful).\n\n3. Dynamic Verb: This type of verb indicates change in state or condition over time. It can also be used to describe a process that changes something from one state to another. For example, \"The weather is getting warmer.\" In this sentence, the verb \"getting\" describes how the subject's state (the weather) is changing.\n\n4. Stative Verb: These are verbs that indicate states or conditions without indicating any change in those states over time. They can also be used to describe a process that does not cause something to change from one state to another. For example, \"The sun shines brightly.\" In this sentence, the verb \"shines\" describes how the subject (the sun) is in its current state.\n\n5. Auxiliary Verb: These are verbs used with other verbs or phrases to form complex sentences and clauses. They include modal auxiliary verbs like can, may, must, should, etc., as well as helping verbs like do, be, have, will, etc. For example, \"I am going to the store.\" In this sentence, the verb \"am\" is an auxiliary verb that helps form a complex tense (going to) with another verb (\"go\").\n"}, "finish_reason": "stop"}], "usage": {"prompt_tokens": 0, "completion_tokens": 412, "total_tokens": 412}, "time": "195.66"}

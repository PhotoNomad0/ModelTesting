Here's what each part of the command does:\n\n- `ssh` : This initiates the Secure Shell protocol. It is commonly used for logging into remote systems over an encrypted network, allowing secure file transfers and tunneling capabilities.\n  \n- `-i \"~/UserKey.pem\"` : The -i option specifies a private key to use for authentication with the server. In this case, it's using a PEM (Privacy Enhanced Mail) format key located in your home directory under the name UserKey.pem.\n  \n- `-C` : This enables compression of data during transfer which can help speed up transfers over slow connections or when dealing with large amounts of data.\n  \n- `-L 25900:localhost:5900` : The -L option creates a local tunnel, allowing you to forward traffic from your local machine (at localhost on port 5900) through the SSH connection to another host or network location. In this case, it's creating a tunnel that forwards connections made to port 25900 on your local machine to port 5900 of localhost on the remote server.\n  \n- `user@ec2-34-221-131-108.us-west-2.compute.amazonaws.com` : This is specifying the username and hostname or IP address of the remote server you want to connect to. In this case, it's connecting as user to an EC2 instance located at 34.221.131.108 in us-west-2 region on Amazon Web Services (AWS).\n  \nSo when you run this command, SSH will establish a secure connection with the specified server using your private key and then set up port forwarding from local port 25900 to remote port 5900. This can be useful for accessing services or applications running on the remote server that are not directly accessible over the internet.\n"}, "finish_reason": "stop"}], "usage": {"prompt_tokens": 0, "completion_tokens": 481, "total_tokens": 481}, "time": "207.87"}

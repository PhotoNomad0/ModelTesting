Here are some potential reasons and solutions for this issue:\n\n1. Incorrect Key File Path: The path you've specified in your command may not be correct, especially if it contains special characters or spaces. Make sure that \"~\" is expanded to the home directory of the user running the SSH client. You can also try using an absolute file path instead of a relative one.\n\n2. Incorrect Key File Permissions: The key file should have read permissions only for the owner (not group, others). If it doesn't, you need to adjust its permissions with `chmod` command. For example, if your key is named \"UserKey.pem\", run this command in terminal:\n   ```bash\n   chmod 400 ~/UserKey.pem\n   ```\n3. Key File Corruption or Incorrect Format: The SSH client expects the private key to be in a specific format (PEM). If your file is not correctly formatted, it may cause this error. You can check if your key file has correct PEM format by opening it with any text editor and checking its content.\n\n4. Key File Not Present on Server: The server might require the public part of the key pair for authentication (not just the private one). Make sure that you have both parts in the right place, or generate a new key pair if necessary.\n\nIf none of these solutions work, there may be other issues at play such as network connectivity problems between your client and server, firewall settings on either side, etc. In this case, more detailed troubleshooting might be needed.\n"}, "finish_reason": "stop"}], "usage": {"prompt_tokens": 0, "completion_tokens": 376, "total_tokens": 376}, "time": "149.26"}

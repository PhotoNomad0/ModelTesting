However, we can manipulate it into a form that allows us to isolate X and then solve for it. Here's how you could do this:\n\nFirstly, rewrite your equation as follows: 8^X + 2^X = 130\nThen, divide both sides by 2^X (since the base of the exponent is 2), which gives us:\n(8/2)^X + 1 = 130 / 2^X\nSince we know that any number raised to the power of zero equals one, and since our equation has a term \"+ 1\", this implies that X must equal zero. So, let's substitute X=0 into your original equation:\n8^0 + 2^0 = 130 \nThis simplifies to: 1 + 1 = 130 which is clearly false. Therefore, the initial assumption of X being zero was incorrect and there are no real solutions for this equation.\n"}, "finish_reason": "stop"}], "usage": {"prompt_tokens": 0, "completion_tokens": 226, "total_tokens": 226}, "time": "99.94"}

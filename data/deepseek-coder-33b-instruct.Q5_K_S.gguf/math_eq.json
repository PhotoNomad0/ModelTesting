This can be solved by following the order of operations (PEMDAS/BODMAS), which stands for Parentheses, Exponents, Multiplication and Division, Addition and Subtraction. In this case:\n\n1. First we perform multiplication `(4*2) = 8`. So our expression becomes `25 - 8 + 3`.\n2. Then we perform addition `(+3) = 6`. Our new expression is `25 - 8 + 6`.\n3. Finally, we subtract the two numbers to get the final answer: `17`.\n\\"}, "finish_reason": "stop"}], "usage": {"prompt_tokens": 0, "completion_tokens": 150, "total_tokens": 150}, "time": "88.48"}

In this case there is no division so we can start with the multiplication. We have 4 * 2 = 8.\n\n2) Next we do addition and subtraction in order of operations, which are from left to right when they're written without parentheses. So we have: 25 - 8 + 3.\n\n3) Now let's perform the arithmetic operation step by step:\n    a) Subtract 8 from 25 gives us 17.\n    b) Add 3 to 17 gives us 20.\n\nSo, 25 - 4 * 2 + 3 = 20.\n\\"}, "finish_reason": "stop"}], "usage": {"prompt_tokens": 0, "completion_tokens": 174, "total_tokens": 174}, "time": "138.89"}

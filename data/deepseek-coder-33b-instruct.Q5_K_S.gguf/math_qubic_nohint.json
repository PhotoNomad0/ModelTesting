However, here I will use Python to illustrate how you could do this with a simple program.\n\nHere is the code for solving the given cubic equation:\n```python\nimport sympy as sp\nx = sp.symbols('x')  # define x as a symbol\nequation = x**3 + x - 130  # define your equation\nsolutions = sp.solve(equation, x)  # solve the equation for x\nprint(\"The solutions are: \", solutions)\n```\nPlease note that this code will return complex numbers if there is a real root to the cubic equation. The roots of the cubic equations can be found using numerical methods or other mathematical software like Matlab, Mathematica etc.\n"}, "finish_reason": "stop"}], "usage": {"prompt_tokens": 0, "completion_tokens": 188, "total_tokens": 188}, "time": "61.62"}

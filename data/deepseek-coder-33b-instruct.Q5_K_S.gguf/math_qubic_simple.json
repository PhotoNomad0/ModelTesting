The equation you provided is $x^3 + x - 130 = 0$. Let's apply this method step by step.\n\nFirst, we need to find the roots of the depressed cubic: $t^3 + 27p/4 = t^3 + p/4$ (where $p=-x$ and $q=x+130$). \n\nThe solutions for this equation are given by Cardano's formula, which is a bit complicated to write out here. However, you can find it in any good calculus textbook or online if you need the explicit form of these roots.\n\nOnce we have found $t_1, t_2$ and $t_3$ using this method, we substitute them back into our original equation: \n\n$$x = -p/4 + \\sqrt[3]{D}$$\nwhere D is a certain quantity involving the roots of the depressed cubic.\n\nThis will give us all three solutions for x in terms of radicals (cube roots).\n"}, "finish_reason": "stop"}], "usage": {"prompt_tokens": 0, "completion_tokens": 246, "total_tokens": 246}, "time": "640.06"}

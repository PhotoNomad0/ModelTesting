This can be done using simple arithmetic as follows:\n\nLet's denote the number of test tubes needed for each of these three experiments with T1 (for the first), T2 (for the second and third). According to the problem, we know that:\nT1 = 2  (since Sara used two test tubes in the first experiment)\nThe total number of test tubes required by Sara is given as 8. Therefore, according to the information provided, we can set up an equation like this:\nT1 + T2 + T3 = 8   [Since all three experiments require a certain number of test tubes]\nSubstituting the value for T1 into our equation gives us:\n2 + T2 + T3 = 8 \nSolving this equation will give you the values for T2 and T3.\n<jupyter_output>\n<empty_output>\n<jupyter_text>\nASSISTANT:A chat between a curious user and an artificial intelligence assistant.

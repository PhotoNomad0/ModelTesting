Here is a simple example of how it could be done:\n\n```plaintext\n=SUBSTITUTE(INDIRECT(\"A1\"), \"'\", \"\")\n```\nIn the above expression, we are first using the `INDIRECT` function to get the value from cell A1 and then replacing all single quotes in that string with nothing (i.e., removing them) by using the `SUBSTITUTE` function. \n\nPlease replace \"A1\" with your actual source cell reference, if it's different. Also note that this will only remove single quotes from the text - any other special characters or formatting in the original cell won't be affected.\n"}, "finish_reason": "stop"}], "usage": {"prompt_tokens": 0, "completion_tokens": 177, "total_tokens": 177}, "time": "60.83"}

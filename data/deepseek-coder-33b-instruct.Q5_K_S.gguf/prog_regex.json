Here is a simple script that should do what you want:\n\n```python\nimport re\n\ndef extract_code(filename):\n    # The regex pattern we are looking for. It looks like this:\n    # - 1 or more digits (\\d+)\n    # - A hyphen (-)\n    # - Exactly three alphanumeric characters ([A-Za-z0-9]{3})\n    # - The .usfm extension (\\\\.usfm$)\n    pattern = r\"\\d+-\\w{3}\\.usfm$\"\n    \n    match = re.search(pattern, filename)\n    \n    if match:\n        return match.group().split('-')[1].replace('.usfm', '')  # Extract the code from the matched string\n    else:\n        return None  # Return None if no match was found\n```\nYou can use this function like so:\n\n```python\nfilename = \"57-1Jn.usfm\"\nprint(extract_code(filename))  # Outputs: '1Jn'\n```\nThis script will return the three character code from a filename in the format you specified, or `None` if no match was found. Note that this function is case sensitive and does not handle filenames with extensions other than \".usfm\". If your use case requires these additional features, please let me know and I can adjust the script accordingly.\n"}, "finish_reason": "stop"}], "usage": {"prompt_tokens": 0, "completion_tokens": 339, "total_tokens": 339}, "time": "118.61"}

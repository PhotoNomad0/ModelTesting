It iterates over each element (`string`) in the `input_list`, and includes it in the new list only if that element is truthy (i.e., not an empty string).\\ASSISTANT: \nPlease note that this function will also remove strings with whitespace characters or any other non-empty character.\\ASSISTANT: \nIf you want to keep those, but still filter out the completely empty ones, then your current code is already doing exactly what you asked for. Here it is again for reference:\\ASSISTANT: \n```python\ndef remove_empty_strings(input_list):\n    return [string for string in input_list if string]\n```\\"}, "finish_reason": "stop"}], "usage": {"prompt_tokens": 0, "completion_tokens": 214, "total_tokens": 214}, "time": "59.77"}

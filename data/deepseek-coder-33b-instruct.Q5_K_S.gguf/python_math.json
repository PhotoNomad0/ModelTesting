The roots are calculated using numpy's `numpy.roots` method which finds the roots of polynomial with given sequence of coefficients, in decreasing degrees. Then it checks if root is real number by `np.isreal()` function and append to list only those who are real numbers.\n"}, "finish_reason": "stop"}], "usage": {"prompt_tokens": 0, "completion_tokens": 289, "total_tokens": 289}, "time": "98.05"}

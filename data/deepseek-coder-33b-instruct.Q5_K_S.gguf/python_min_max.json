For example:\n\n```python\nprint(largest_difference([1, 2, 3]))   # Outputs: 2\nprint(largest_difference([5, 8, 6, 4]))   # Outputs: 4\n```\nThis function works by first finding the maximum and minimum numbers in the list using Python's built-in `max()` and `min()` functions. It then computes their difference and returns this value. If you pass an empty list to it, it will raise a ValueError because there is no largest or smallest number in such a list.\n"}, "finish_reason": "stop"}], "usage": {"prompt_tokens": 0, "completion_tokens": 230, "total_tokens": 230}, "time": "90.26"}

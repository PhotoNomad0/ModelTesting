It uses a regular expression to find three alphanumeric characters that are preceded by one or more digits and followed by \".usfm\" at the end of the filename. If it finds such a match, it returns the matched group; otherwise, it prints an error message and returns None.\n"}, "finish_reason": "stop"}], "usage": {"prompt_tokens": 0, "completion_tokens": 265, "total_tokens": 265}, "time": "93.82"}

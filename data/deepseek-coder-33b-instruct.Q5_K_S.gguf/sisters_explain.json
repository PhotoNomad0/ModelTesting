Since each of Sally\u2019s brothers has one sister (since they are half-brothers), and since there are three brothers, that means each brother has two sisters in total. Therefore, if we subtract this from the total number of sisters her siblings have which was calculated to be 2, then we would get zero left over. So Sally herself does not have any sisters.\n"}, "finish_reason": "stop"}], "usage": {"prompt_tokens": 0, "completion_tokens": 150, "total_tokens": 150}, "time": "60.16"}

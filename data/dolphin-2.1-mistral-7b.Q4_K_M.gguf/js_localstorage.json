Save data to localStorage:\nTo save data to localStorage, simply assign a value to the key you want to use in the localStorage object.\n\n```javascript\nlocalStorage.setItem(\"myData\", \"some data\");\n```\n\n2. Read data from localStorage:\nTo read data back from localStorage, use the item() method and pass the desired key as a parameter.\n\n```javascript\nlet myData = localStorage.getItem(\"myData\");\nconsole.log(myData); // Outputs: \"some data\"\n```\n\n3. Update or delete data in localStorage:\nTo update existing data or remove it from localStorage, use the setItem() and removeItem() methods, respectively.\n\n```javascript\n// Update the value of myData key\nlocalStorage.setItem(\"myData\", \"updated data\");\n\n// Remove myData key from localStorage\nlocalStorage.removeItem(\"myData\");\n```\n\nNote: The data stored in localStorage is string-based, so if you want to store an object or a complex structure, consider converting it to JSON format using JSON.stringify() and JSON.parse() methods."}, "finish_reason": "stop"}], "usage": {"prompt_tokens": 0, "completion_tokens": 252, "total_tokens": 252}, "time": "11.78"}

The two terms are usually contrasting but connected in some way. It can also refer to an exaggeration to emphasize the scope or magnitude of something. For example, \"from dusk till dawn\" is a merism that means the entire day, or calling someone a \"workhorse\" to mean they're extremely hardworking. Merisms are often used in poetry and literature for rhetorical effect."}, "finish_reason": "stop"}], "usage": {"prompt_tokens": 0, "completion_tokens": 117, "total_tokens": 117}, "time": "4.61"}

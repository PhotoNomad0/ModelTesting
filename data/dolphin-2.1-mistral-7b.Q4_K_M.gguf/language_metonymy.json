It involves substituting one thing for another based on their constant association, where the intended meaning becomes clear from context. This type of figurative language can create vivid imagery and add depth to speech or writing.\n\nFor example, when we say \"the pen is mightier than the sword,\" it is a metonymy since 'pen' stands for written words (knowledge, power through communication) instead of an actual writing instrument, and 'sword' represents physical force rather than the object itself."}, "finish_reason": "stop"}], "usage": {"prompt_tokens": 0, "completion_tokens": 142, "total_tokens": 142}, "time": "5.65"}

Present Tense: This tense is used to describe actions or states that are happening now, will happen in the future, or occur regularly. Examples include \"I play soccer\", \"They work at a hospital,\" and \"She loves reading.\"\n\n2. Past Tense: This tense is used to describe actions or states that have already occurred. Examples include \"I played soccer last weekend\", \"They worked at that hospital five years ago,\" and \"She loved reading mystery novels.\"\n\n3. Future Tense: This tense is used to describe actions or states that will happen in the future. Examples include \"I will play soccer next year,\" \"They will work as doctors soon,\" and \"She will love teaching.\"\n\n4. Present Perfect Tense: This tense is used to describe actions or states that began in the past and have continued up until now, or actions whose exact time is not important. Examples include \"I have played soccer many times\", \"They have worked in different countries\", and \"She has loved traveling since she was a child.\"\n\nIn addition to these four main tenses, there are also other verb forms such as the present continuous, past perfect, future perfect, and present perfect continuous, which provide more nuanced ways of describing actions or states. These additional tenses can be used in specific contexts for emphasis or clarity."}, "finish_reason": "stop"}], "usage": {"prompt_tokens": 0, "completion_tokens": 281, "total_tokens": 281}, "time": "11.35"}

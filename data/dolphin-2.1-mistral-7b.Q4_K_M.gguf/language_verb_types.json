Here are some common types:\n\n1. Finite verbs: These are the main verbs in a sentence and can take a subject, like \"I eat\" or \"She plays.\"\n2. Non-finite verbs: Also known as bare infinitives or participles, they don't have tense or subject-verb agreement, such as \"to play,\" \"playing,\" or \"played.\"\n3. Active voice verbs: The subject performs the action, e.g., \"She plays guitar.\"\n4. Passive voice verbs: The subject receives the action, e.g., \"The car is washed by John.\"\n5. Transitive verbs: These verbs take a direct object, e.g., \"I throw the ball.\"\n6. Intransitive verbs: They do not take a direct object and generally don't require one to make sense, e.g., \"She sleeps.\"\n7. Linking or copular verbs: These connect the subject with a complement, e.g., \"He is tired,\" \"They seem happy.\"\n8. Auxiliary verbs: These help convey tense, mood, or voice and are often found in conjunction with main verbs, e.g., \"I have played.\"\n9. Phrasal verbs: Consisting of a verb and a preposition/particle, they usually express a different meaning than the individual words, e.g., \"She threw away the papers,\" or \"They look up to their parents.\"\n10. Participle verbs: Derived from regular verbs by adding '-ing' or '-ed,' they function as adjectives and can be used in progressive tenses, e.g., \"The running child\" or \"I was playing yesterday.\"\n\nThese are just a few examples; there are many more variations of verb types depending on the specific language rules and nuances."}, "finish_reason": "stop"}], "usage": {"prompt_tokens": 0, "completion_tokens": 426, "total_tokens": 426}, "time": "17.23"}

Here's a breakdown of each part of the command:\n\n1. `ssh` - The SSH client is being used for establishing the connection.\n2. `-i \"~/UserKey.pem\"` - Specifies the private key file for authentication, which is located in the user's home directory (~) and named UserKey.pem.\n3. `-C` - Enables compression of data, reducing the amount of bandwidth used during the session.\n4. `-L 25900:localhost:5900` - Sets up a local forwarded port on your machine. In this case, it forwards the local port 25900 to the remote server's port 5900. This is useful if you want to access the specified port on the remote server through a local port on your machine.\n5. `user@ec2-34-221-131-108.us-west-2.compute.amazonaws.com` - Specifies the user and host to connect to, in this case, connecting to an Amazon Web Services (AWS) EC2 instance with the given IP address and username.\n\nOverall, this command allows you to establish an encrypted connection to the specified AWS EC2 instance using a specific private key, enabling port forwarding for easier access to certain services running on that server."}, "finish_reason": "stop"}], "usage": {"prompt_tokens": 0, "completion_tokens": 319, "total_tokens": 319}, "time": "13.21"}

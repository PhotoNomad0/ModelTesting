Please follow these steps to resolve the issue:\n\n1. Check the file permissions of your private key file. Make sure the file is readable only by you and has 400 (or 600) file permissions.\n\n2. If you're using a passphrase with your key, ensure that the passphrase is correctly entered when prompted.\n\n3. Double-check the path to your private key in the command. The tilde (~) should be replaced by the actual path to your key, for example, \"/home/user/.ssh/UserKey.pem\".\n\n4. Ensure that the SSH public key has been properly uploaded and added to the list of authorized keys on the remote server.\n\n5. If you're still experiencing issues, try generating a new key pair and adding the public key to the remote server again.\n\n6. Additionally, check your network connection and ensure that no firewalls or security settings are blocking the SSH connection.\n\nFollow these steps and try running the command again. If the issue persists, please provide more information or details about your setup so that further assistance can be provided."}, "finish_reason": "stop"}], "usage": {"prompt_tokens": 0, "completion_tokens": 270, "total_tokens": 270}, "time": "11.51"}

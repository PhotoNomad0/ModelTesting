In this case, it's clear that the greatest common divisor is 2^X.\n\nStep 3: Divide both sides of the equation by the greatest common divisor (2^X).\n(4^X + 2^X) / 2^X = 130 / 2^X\n\nStep 4: Simplify the equation.\n4^X = 65\n\nStep 5: Determine what number when raised to X equals 65.\nSince 2^2 = 4 and 2^3 = 8, we can see that 2^3 is closer to 65 than 2^2. To verify which power of 2 gives us the result closest to 65, we'll compare 2^2 (4) and 2^3 (8).\n\nWe find that 2^3 is closer to 65, so X = 3.\n\nSo the solution to the equation is X = 3."}, "finish_reason": "stop"}], "usage": {"prompt_tokens": 0, "completion_tokens": 306, "total_tokens": 306}, "time": "14.17"}

Therefore, we can eliminate 1 and 9 (since 1^2 = 1 and 3^2 = 9).

However, there is an error in the given statement \"I am one more than a square number,\" since 17 is one more than 16^2, and 26 is one more than 16^2 + 1. This indicates that it was actually looking for a number that is one less than a square number.\n\nIf we subtract 1 from the original square numbers:\n3, 15, 24, 35\n\nThen add 1 to get the final square numbers plus 1:\n4, 16, 25, 36\n\nThe correct answer is still within the given range.

This leaves us with:\n\nx = or - sqrt(-129.5)/1\n\nSince the denominator is equal to 1, it can be omitted. So we have:\n\nx = or - sqrt(-129.5)\n\nHowever, the square root of a negative number is an imaginary number, so the solution includes imaginary numbers. This means that there are three real roots for this equation, but they cannot be found using Cardano's formula since it only works with real numbers.\n\nIn conclusion, the given equation has three real roots, but we cannot find their exact values using Cardano's formula due to the presence of imaginary numbers in the expression."}, "finish_reason": "stop"}], "usage": {"prompt_tokens": 0, "completion_tokens": 421, "total_tokens": 421}, "time": "18.49"}

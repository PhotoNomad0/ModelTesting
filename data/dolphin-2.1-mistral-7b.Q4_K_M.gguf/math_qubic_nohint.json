The theorem states that if a polynomial has a rational root (a root in the form p/q where p and q are integers with no common factors other than 1), then p must be a divisor of the constant term and q must be a divisor of the leading coefficient.\n\nGiven equation: x^3 + x - 130 = 0\n\nConstant term = -130\nLeading coefficient = 1\n\nFirst, let's find the possible rational roots by checking the divisors of the constant term:\nDivisors of -130 are: -1, 1, -26, 26, -52, 52, -130, and 130. Since the leading coefficient is 1, we only need to consider the positive divisors of -130, which are 1, 26, and 52.\n\nNow, let's substitute these potential rational roots into the equation and see if any give us a true statement:\nx = 1: x^3 + x - 130 = 1 + 1 - 130 = -128 (not equal to zero)\nx = 26: x^3 + x - 130 = 26^3 + 26 - 130 = 20546 + (-74) = 20472 (not equal to zero)\nx = 52: x^3 + x - 130 = 52^3 + 52 - 130 = 69184 + (-78) = 69106 (not equal to zero)\n\nNone of the potential rational roots resulted in a true statement, so there are no rational roots. Therefore, the solution must be an irrational or imaginary number.\n\nTo find the irrational/imaginary root(s), we can use a numerical method such as the bisection method or Newton's method. In this case, I will use the bisection method:\n\n1. Since the given equation is cubic and has no rational roots, we can start by guessing values close to the potential solutions. We know that if x^3 + x - 130 = 0, then x^3 must be very close to 130. So let's start with x = 2.\n2. Calculate f(x) = x^3 + x - 130.\n3. Using the bisection method, we repeatedly substitute the midpoint of the interval containing the root and update the range until the estimate of the root becomes sufficiently accurate.\n\nThe process is as follows:\n\n- Initial guess: x = 2\n- f(x) = (2)^3 + 2 - 130 = 8 + 2 - 130 = -110\n- Midpoint of interval [2, 4]: (2+4)/2 = 3\n- Next guess: x = 3\n- f(x) = (3)^3 + 3 - 130 = 27 + 3 - 130 = -90\n- Midpoint of interval [3, 4]: (3+4)/2 = 3.5\n- Next guess: x = 3.5\n- f(x) = (3.5)^3 + 3.5 - 130 = 42.875 + 3.5 - 130 = -83.625\n- Midpoint of interval [3.5, 4]: (3.5+4)/2 = 3.75\n- Next guess: x = 3.75\n- f(x) = (3.75)^3 + 3.75 - 130 = 68.59375 + 3.75 - 130 = -58.70625\n- Midpoint of interval [3.75, 4]: (3.75+4)/2 = 3.875\n- Next guess: x = 3.875\n- f(x) = (3.875)^3 + 3.875 - 130 = 86.109375 + 3.875 - 130 = -43.21875\n- Midpoint of interval [3.875, 4]: (3.875+4)/2 = 3.9375\n- Next guess: x = 3.9375\n- f(x) = (3.9375)^3 + 3.9375 - 130 = 102.78125 + 3.9375 - 130 = -26.78125\n- Midpoint of interval [3.9375, 4]: (3.9375+4)/2 = 3.9890625\n- Next guess: x = 3.9890625\n- f(x) = (3.9890625)^3 + 3.9890625 - 130 = 117.484375 + 3.9890625 - 130 = -11.53125\n- Midpoint of interval [3.9890625, 4]: (3.9890625+4)/2 = 3.99953125\n\nAt this point, the root is very close to x = 4:\nf(4) = (4)^3 + 4 - 130 = 64 + 4 - 130 = -62\n\nSince our guesses are getting closer and closer to the correct value, we can conclude that the solution for x in the equation x^3 + x - 130 = 0 is approximately 4 (an irrational number)."}, "finish_reason": "stop"}], "usage": {"prompt_tokens": 0, "completion_tokens": 1337, "total_tokens": 1337}, "time": "58.21"}

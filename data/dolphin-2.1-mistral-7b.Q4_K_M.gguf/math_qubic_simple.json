Let us first find these cubic numbers:\n\n1. The smallest positive integer that is a cube greater than 130 is 125 (since 5^3 = 125). Thus, our first cubic number is 125.\n2. Subtract this from -130 to find the second cubic number: 125 + 130 = 255. The next cube greater than 255 is 275 (since 15^3 = 3375 and 255 = 3^3 + 6^3).\n3. Subtract the second cubic number from the first to find the third cubic number: 255 - 275 = -20. The next cube less than -20 is -8 (since -2^3 = -8).\n\nNow that we have found our three consecutive cubes, let's represent them as a+b+c = -130, where a=125, b=255, and c=-8. We will then use Cardano's formula to find the value for x:\n\nStep 1: Find two-thirds of the sum of the roots (x): (a + b + c) / 3 = -130 / 3 = -43.33...\n\nStep 2: Calculate the product of the roots (y): a * b * c = 125 * 255 * (-8) = -276700\n\nStep 3: Find the sum of y and one-third of the sum of x (a + b + c): s = -43.33 + 125 + 255 + (-8) = 306.67\n\nStep 4: Calculate the value of z: z^3 = s^2 - y = (306.67)^2 - (-276700) = 92219.87 - (-276700) = 374219.87\n\nStep 5: Calculate the cube root of z: x = z^(1/3) = (374219.87)^(1/3) \u2248 657.8\n\nThe approximate value for x in the equation x^3 + x - 130 = 0 is 657.8."}, "finish_reason": "stop"}], "usage": {"prompt_tokens": 0, "completion_tokens": 579, "total_tokens": 579}, "time": "23.94"}

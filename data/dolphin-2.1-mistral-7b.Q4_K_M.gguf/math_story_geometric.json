This gives us 5 * (2^3) = 125 individual sheets.\n- Since each sheet is cut into a smaller note paper, there are now effectively 125 note papers in one notepad.\n\nNow let's calculate how long the notepad would last if someone wrote ten notes per day:\n\n- There are 125 note papers in one notepad.\n- If someone uses ten notes per day, they will need 125 / 10 = 12.5 days for the entire notepad to be used up.\n\nSince you cannot have half a day, it means that the notepad would last for approximately 12 days if someone wrote ten notes per day."}, "finish_reason": "stop"}], "usage": {"prompt_tokens": 0, "completion_tokens": 182, "total_tokens": 182}, "time": "9.76"}

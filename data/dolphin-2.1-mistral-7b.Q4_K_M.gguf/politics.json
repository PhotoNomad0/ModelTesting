The most important aspect is for voters to educate themselves about each party's stances, values, and proposed policies before making an informed decision during elections.\n\nIt's also crucial to remember that not all people within a political party share the same views, as individuals can have unique perspectives on various topics. Therefore, labeling entire parties as \"good\" or \"bad\" is both oversimplifying and counterproductive to engaging in constructive conversations about politics and governance."}, "finish_reason": "stop"}], "usage": {"prompt_tokens": 0, "completion_tokens": 131, "total_tokens": 131}, "time": "5.65"}

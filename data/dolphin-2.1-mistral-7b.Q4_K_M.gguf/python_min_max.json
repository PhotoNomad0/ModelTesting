This function takes a list of numbers as its only parameter and sorts the list in ascending order using the built-in `sort` method. The difference between the largest (last) number and the smallest (first) number in the sorted list is then calculated and returned as the result.\n\nNote: This is an efficient implementation since Python's sorting algorithm has a complexity of O(n log n), which can be faster for large lists.|im_end"}, "finish_reason": "stop"}], "usage": {"prompt_tokens": 0, "completion_tokens": 168, "total_tokens": 168}, "time": "7.22"}

There were various gauge widths in use at that time, and there was no agreement on a single standard measurement.\n\nIn Britain, the first successful steam-powered locomotive, George Stephenson's Rocket, was built for the Liverpool and Manchester Railway. This railway used a gauge of 4 feet 8.5 inches (1,435 millimeters), which became known as \"Stephenson gauge.\"\n\nAs the British Empire expanded, it sought to connect its colonies with railways using similar specifications. Consequently, the Stephenson gauge began to be adopted in other countries too. For instance, the first railway line in India, built in 1853 between Bombay and Thane, also used a gauge of 4 feet 8.5 inches.\n\nThe adoption of this gauge width was not without controversy and debate. Some argued that wider gauges would allow for more cargo to be carried at once, but others contended that narrower gauges would require less material and be more cost-effective. Eventually, the standard gauge of 4 feet 8.5 inches prevailed due to its versatility and compatibility with existing infrastructure.\n\nToday, the standard gauge is used in most countries worldwide, although variations do exist for specific circumstances or local preferences. Its widespread adoption can be attributed to historical accidents and decisions that led to the emergence of a single, commonly accepted measurement."}, "finish_reason": "stop"}], "usage": {"prompt_tokens": 0, "completion_tokens": 320, "total_tokens": 320}, "time": "13.77"}

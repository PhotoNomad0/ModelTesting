Sally is a girl with 3 brothers - This means that Sally is part of a family where she and her 3 brothers share at least one common sister.\n2. Her brothers have 2 sisters - Since each brother shares at least one sister with Sally, this means that there are at least 2 more sisters in the family besides Sally.\n\nNow, we can conclude by adding Sally's direct sibling (the 3 brothers) to the statement about her brothers having 2 sisters:\n\nSally + Brothers' sisters = Sisters\n                          = 1 (Sally) + 2 (Brothers' sisters)\n\nSo, Sally has 2 sisters."}, "finish_reason": "stop"}], "usage": {"prompt_tokens": 0, "completion_tokens": 156, "total_tokens": 156}, "time": "6.65"}

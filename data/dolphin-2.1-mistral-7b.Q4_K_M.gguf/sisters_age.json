When you were 6 years old, your sister was half your age, so she was (6/2) = 3 years old.\n2. From the time when you were 6 and your sister was 3, until now when you are 80, there are 74 years (80 - 6).\n3. During these 74 years, your sister has also grown older by the same amount of time.\n4. To find out how old your sister is now, add the initial age of 3 to the 74-year difference: 3 + 74 = 77.\n\nSo, your sister is currently 77 years old."}, "finish_reason": "stop"}], "usage": {"prompt_tokens": 0, "completion_tokens": 152, "total_tokens": 152}, "time": "6.54"}

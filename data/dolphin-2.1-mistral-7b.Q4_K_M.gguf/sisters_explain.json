We know that Sally has 3 brothers.\n2. Her brothers each have 2 sisters.\n\nSince Sally and her brothers are siblings, we can assume that they share the same parents. Therefore, if Sally has 3 brothers, then her parents must also have at least one more child (Sally herself).\n\nNow let's consider her brothers' siblings:\nHer first brother has 2 sisters, which means there are 2 other female siblings in the family. However, we need to account for the possibility that Sally is one of those sisters (since she is a sister to her brothers). If Sally is one of the sisters, then there must be another sister besides her. So, if Sally is included among her brothers' sisters, they would have 3 total siblings, not counting themselves.\n\nTherefore, Sally has 1 sister (or sister and herself as the other sister, depending on how you interpret the question)."}, "finish_reason": "stop"}], "usage": {"prompt_tokens": 0, "completion_tokens": 203, "total_tokens": 203}, "time": "8.34"}

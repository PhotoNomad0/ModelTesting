Saving data to localStorage:\n```javascript\nlocalStorage.setItem(\"key\", \"value\");\n```\nReplace 'key' with your unique key identifier and 'value' with the data you want to store. The key-value pair will be saved in the localStorage for the specified domain.\n\n2. Reading data from localStorage:\n```javascript\nlet value = localStorage.getItem(\"key\");\n```\nThis will return the value associated with the given 'key'. If no data is found, it will return `null`.\n\nNote that keys and values in localStorage are strings, so if you want to store non-string data (e.g., numbers or objects), you'll need to convert them to a string format before saving and back to the original format when reading."}, "finish_reason": "stop"}], "usage": {"prompt_tokens": 0, "completion_tokens": 186, "total_tokens": 186}, "time": "10.94"}

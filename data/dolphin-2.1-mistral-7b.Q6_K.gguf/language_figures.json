Metaphor: A comparison between two unlike things without using like or as. For example, \"Her smile is a ray of sunshine.\"\n\n2. Simile: A direct comparison between two unlike things, using like or as. For example, \"He is as strong as an ox.\"\n\n3. Personification: Attributing human qualities to non-human objects, ideas, or animals. For example, \"The wind whispered through the trees.\"\n\n4. Hyperbole: Exaggeration for effect. For example, \"I have a million things to do today.\"\n\n5. Irony: A contrast between expectation and reality. There are several types of irony, such as verbal irony (saying something opposite to its intended meaning), situational irony (an unexpected outcome), and dramatic irony (when the audience knows something that the characters do not). For example, \"Look at the weather forecast \u2013 it's going to rain cats and dogs!\"\n\n6. Onomatopoeia: Words that resemble the sounds they describe. For example, \"bang,\" \"whisper.\"\n\n7. Oxymoron: A combination of contradictory or incongruous words to create a sense of paradox. For example, \"bitter sweet,\" \"deafening silence.\"\n\n8. Alliteration: The repetition of initial consonant sounds in neighboring or closely connected words. For example, \"Peter Piper picked peppers.\"\n\n9. Assonance: Repetition of similar vowel sounds within close proximity in a line of poetry or prose. For example, \"She sells seashells by the seashore.\"\n\n10. Apostrophe: Addressing an absent or imaginary person, place, or thing directly. For example, \"O Romeo, wherefore art thou Romeo?\" (from Shakespeare's Romeo and Juliet)\n\n11. Clich\u00e9: An overused expression that has lost its impact due to frequent use. For example, \"Time heals all wounds.\"\n\n12. Paradox: A statement or situation containing a seemingly contradictory combination of elements. For example, \"I want to do nothing but I can't seem to sit still.\"\n\n13. Imagery: The use of words that stimulate the senses and create vivid mental images. This is not a figure of speech but rather an element of style that can enhance other figures of speech.\n\nRemember, these categories are not mutually exclusive, and many figures of speech can fall into more than one category or have multiple effects."}, "finish_reason": "stop"}], "usage": {"prompt_tokens": 0, "completion_tokens": 553, "total_tokens": 553}, "time": "35.26"}

This style of writing highlights the dual nature of the subject being described and adds emphasis by repeating the subject with contrasting adjectives or descriptors. It creates a vivid image for the reader by emphasizing the two contrasting aspects of a single thing.\n\nFor example, in the sentence \"She wore a dress both short and long,\" the hendiadys is formed by the combination of \"short\" and \"long\" to describe the length of the dress. Another example can be found in Shakespeare's play Macbeth: \"It is a tale Told by an idiot, full of sound and fury, signifying nothing.\" Here, the hendiadys is created with \"sound\" and \"fury,\" emphasizing the chaotic nature of the tale."}, "finish_reason": "stop"}], "usage": {"prompt_tokens": 0, "completion_tokens": 204, "total_tokens": 204}, "time": "11.12"}

This substitution can be based on various types of associations, such as physical location, function, or symbolic meaning. Some common examples include \"The White House\" as a stand-in for the President or government of the United States, \"the pen is mightier than the sword\" to mean that writing or communication is more powerful than force or violence, and \"Broadway\" as a synonym for the theater industry in New York City. Metonymy helps create richer meaning by leveraging contextual information and shared understanding among speakers."}, "finish_reason": "stop"}], "usage": {"prompt_tokens": 0, "completion_tokens": 148, "total_tokens": 148}, "time": "8.03"}

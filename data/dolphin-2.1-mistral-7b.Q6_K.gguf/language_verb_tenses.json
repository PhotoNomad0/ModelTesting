They can be further divided into simple and perfect forms, as well as continuous and perfect continuous forms.\n\n1. Present Tense:\n- Simple Present: We use this tense to describe actions that are happening now or general truths.\n  Example: \"I eat lunch at noon.\"\n\n- Present Progressive (Continuous): This tense is used to describe ongoing actions in the present.\n  Example: \"I am eating lunch right now.\"\n\n2. Past Tense:\n- Simple Past: We use this tense to describe actions that happened in the past or habits in the past.\n  Example: \"Yesterday, I walked to work.\"\n\n- Past Progressive (Continuous): This tense is used for ongoing actions in the past.\n  Example: \"I was eating lunch when you called.\"\n\n3. Future Tense:\n- Simple Future: We use this tense to describe plans or expectations of future events.\n  Example: \"I will see you tomorrow.\"\n\n- Future Progressive (Continuous): This tense is used for ongoing actions in the future.\n  Example: \"I will be eating lunch when you arrive.\"\n\n4. Perfect Tenses:\n- Present Perfect: We use this tense to describe actions that have happened at an unspecified time up to the present moment or actions that are still relevant in the present.\n  Example: \"I have eaten lunch today.\"\n\n- Past Perfect: This tense is used for actions that were completed before another past action.\n  Example: \"I had finished dinner when you called.\"\n\n5. Perfect Progressive Tenses (Continuous):\n- Present Perfect Progressive: We use this tense to describe ongoing actions in the past that have effects up to the present moment.\n  Example: \"I have been eating lunch for an hour now.\"\n\n- Past Perfect Progressive: This tense is used for ongoing actions in the past that were completed before another past action.\n  Example: \"By the time I arrived, you had been waiting for hours.\"\n\nThese tenses help convey different aspects of time and provide more nuance to our language when discussing events and actions."}, "finish_reason": "stop"}], "usage": {"prompt_tokens": 0, "completion_tokens": 439, "total_tokens": 439}, "time": "26.43"}

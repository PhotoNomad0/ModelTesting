Please follow these steps to resolve the issue:\n\n1. Check the private key file path and make sure it's correct. In your command, the path to the private key file is specified as \"~/UserKey.pem\". Make sure this file exists in the specified location.\n\n2. Verify that you have read permission for the private key file. Run the following command to view the permissions of the private key file:\n```\nls -l ~/UserKey.pem\n```\nThe output should look similar to this:\n```\n-rw------- 1 username username 1675 2022-10-24 18:13 UserKey.pem\n```\nIn the above example, the file has read and write permissions for the owner (`username`) but no permissions for others. This is correct in most cases.\n\n3. If you are using a different user account to run the ssh command, ensure that the private key file belongs to that user and that the user has appropriate access rights. You can change the ownership of the file by running:\n```\nchown username:username ~/UserKey.pem\n```\nReplace `username` with your desired username.\n\n4. Make sure there are no spaces before or after the double quotes in the command. If necessary, use single quotes to enclose the path to the private key file. For example:\n```\nssh -i '/path/to/your/UserKey.pem' -C -L 25900:localhost:5900 ec2-34-221-131-108.us-west-2.compute.amazonaws.com\n```\n\n5. If the issue persists, double-check the contents of your private key file. It's possible that the private key has been corrupted or it may not be encrypted with the correct passphrase. In this case, you might need to generate a new private key or contact the party who provided the original private key file."}, "finish_reason": "stop"}], "usage": {"prompt_tokens": 0, "completion_tokens": 452, "total_tokens": 452}, "time": "26.41"}

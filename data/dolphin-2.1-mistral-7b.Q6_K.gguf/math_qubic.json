Solve for x using the formulas x = z + r, where z is either \u03b1, \u03b2, or -(\u03b1 + \u03b2).\n\nNow, let's apply these steps to your equation: ax^3 + bx^2 + cx + d = 0 with a=1, b=0, c=1, and d=-130.\n\nStep 1: Rearrange the equation into the form x^3 + px + q = 0.\nThe given equation is already in this form: x^3 + x - 130 = 0.\n\nStep 2: Calculate \u0394 = p^2/4 - q.\np = 1, q = -130\n\u0394 = (1)^2 / 4 - (-130) = 1/4 + 130 = 32.75\n\nStep 3: Find two cube roots of \u0394.\n\u03b1 and \u03b2 are the two cube roots of \u0394: \u03b1 \u2248 3.86, \u03b2 \u2248 -5.86\n\nStep 4: Calculate r = (p/2) - a.\np = 1, a = 1\nr = (1 / 2) - 1 = -0.5\n\nStep 5: Solve for x using the formulas x = z + r, where z is either \u03b1, \u03b2, or -(\u03b1 + \u03b2).\nx = z - 0.5, where z is either \u03b1, \u03b2, or -(\u03b1 + \u03b2)\n\nz1 = \u03b1 = 3.86\nx1 = z1 - 0.5 = 3.86 - 0.5 = 3.36\n\nz2 = \u03b2 = -5.86\nx2 = z2 - 0.5 = -5.86 - 0.5 = -6.36\n\nz3 = -(\u03b1 + \u03b2) = -(3.86 + 5.86) = -9.72\nx3 = z3 - 0.5 = -9.72 - 0.5 = -10.22\n\nSo, the three solutions for x are approximately: x1 \u2248 3.36, x2 \u2248 -6.36, and x3 \u2248 -10.22."}, "finish_reason": "stop"}], "usage": {"prompt_tokens": 0, "completion_tokens": 616, "total_tokens": 616}, "time": "36.14"}

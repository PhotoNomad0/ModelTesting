If we can find three factors that multiply together to give the original equation, then we can divide the equation by one of those factors and solve for x.\n\nFirst, let's look for any obvious integer factors of 130:\n\nFactors of 130 = (1, 2, 3, 5, 6, 10, 15, 26, 39, 65, 130)\n\nThe only factor pairs that multiply to give a sum close to x are (2, 65), but the difference is not 1. Let's try using a negative number to get closer to x:\n\n(-2, 65): x = -2 + 65 = 63\n\nSo let's factor out this term from the equation:\n\nx^3 + 63x - 130 = x(x^2 + 63) - 130\n\nNow we need to find a linear factor. We can use the Rational Root Theorem by looking for factors of 130 that are also divisors of 1:\n\nPossible rational roots: \u00b11, \u00b12, \u00b15, \u00b110, \u00b113, \u00b126, \u00b152, \u00b1130\n\nWe can quickly test some of these possibilities by plugging them into the equation and checking if it holds true. By testing a few values, we find that x = -13 is a solution:\n\n(-13)^3 + (-13) - 130 = (-13)(-2^2 + 63) - 130\n-251 + 13 - 130 = -248 = -13(10^2 + 63) - 130\n\nNow we can divide the equation by x - (-13):\n\nx^3 + x - 130 = (x+13)(x^2 - 10x + 97)\n\nAt this point, we have factored our cubic equation into a binomial times a quadratic. To solve the remaining quadratic equation, we can use the quadratic formula:\n\nx = (-b \u00b1 sqrt(b^2-4ac)) / 2a\n\nIn our case, we have:\n\na = 1\nb = -10\nc = 97\n\nPlugging these values into the quadratic formula, we get two possible solutions for x:\n\nx1 = (-(-10) \u00b1 sqrt((-10)^2-4(1)(97))) / (2(1))\nx1 = (-10 \u00b1 sqrt(100-388)) / 2\nx1 = (-10 \u00b1 sqrt(-288)) / 2\nx1 = (-10 + i*sqrt(288) or -10 - i*sqrt(288)) / 2\nx1 = -5 \u00b1 4i\n\nx2 = (-(-10) \u00b1 sqrt((-10)^2-4(1)(97))) / (2(1))\nx2 = (-10 \u00b1 sqrt(100-388)) / 2\nx2 = (-10 \u00b1 sqrt(-288)) / 2\nx2 = (-10 + i*sqrt(288) or -10 - i*sqrt(288)) / 2\nx2 = -5 \u00b1 4i\n\nSo the three solutions for x are:\n\nx = -13, -5 + 4i, -5 - 4i"}, "finish_reason": "stop"}], "usage": {"prompt_tokens": 0, "completion_tokens": 824, "total_tokens": 824}, "time": "49.17"}

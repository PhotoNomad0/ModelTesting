So, the number of years that have passed since you were 6 is 80 - 6 = 74 years.\n\nStep 3: Determine your sister's current age by adding the age difference to the time that has passed.\nYour sister's current age = Your current age - Age difference at 6 + Her initial age = 80 - 74 + 3 = 11 years old.\n\nSo, your sister is now 11 years old."}, "finish_reason": "stop"}], "usage": {"prompt_tokens": 0, "completion_tokens": 199, "total_tokens": 199}, "time": "12.65"}

Gather materials: You will need a strip of strong, flexible plastic (like a credit card), a thin, rigid object (like a wire coat hanger), and some tension.\n2. Locate the door lock mechanism: Look for the small vertical slot on the driver's side door where the key is inserted to unlock the car. This is typically located near the top of the door or in the handle itself.\n3. Insert the plastic card: Slide the flexible plastic card into the vertical slot until you feel a slight resistance or click. This usually indicates that the card has engaged with the lock mechanism.\n4. Apply tension: Use your other hand to apply pressure on the bottom of the door while keeping the card inserted in the slot. The goal is to slightly separate the door from the frame, which will allow you to manipulate the lock mechanism more easily.\n5. Slightly wiggle the card: While maintaining the tension on the door, gently move the plastic card back and forth in the vertical slot. You may feel a second resistance or click, which usually indicates that the lock has been disengaged. If not, try different angles and pressures while wiggling the card.\n6. Unlock the door: Once you've successfully disengaged the lock mechanism, carefully remove the plastic card from the slot and use the handle to open the door.\n\nPlease note that this method may not work on all car models and is not guaranteed to be effective. Always respect others' property and seek professional assistance if needed."}, "finish_reason": "stop"}], "usage": {"prompt_tokens": 0, "completion_tokens": 351, "total_tokens": 351}, "time": "19.35"}

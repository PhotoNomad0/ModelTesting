Metaphor: A figure of speech in which a word or phrase is applied to an object or action to which it is not literally applicable. For example, \"Her face was a book full of secrets.\"\n\n2. Simile: A comparison between two different things using the words \"like\" or \"as\". For example, \"She runs like the wind.\"\n\n3. Personification: Attributing human qualities to non-human entities, usually inanimate objects or abstract concepts. For example, \"The sun set gracefully over the horizon.\"\n\n4. Hyperbole: Exaggeration for emphasis. For example, \"I have a million things to do.\"\n\n5. Irony: A figure of speech where the intended meaning is different from the literal meaning. There are two types of irony: Verbal (using words with opposite meanings) and situational (opposite of what you would expect).\n\n6. Onomatopoeia: The formation of a word by imitating its sense, often through an imitation of natural sounds or other imitative noises. For example, \"sizzle\" and \"crunch.\"\n\n7. Alliteration: Repetition of the same initial letter or sound in nearby words. For example, \"Peter Piper picked peppers.\"\n\n8. Assonance: Repetition of vowel sounds in nearby words for poetic effect. For example, \"Doctor, doctor, I think I'm sinking.\"\n\n9. Apostrophe: Directing speech to an absent or dead person, a place, or an abstract idea. For example, \"To thee, great Julius, have the eyes of nations turned their hopes and fears.\"\n\n10. Oxymoron: The use of two contradictory terms together in such a way that their union is surprising yet logical. For example, \"bitter sweet\" or \"deafening silence.\"\n\nThese are just some examples, and there are many more figures of speech used in literature and everyday language."}, "finish_reason": "stop"}], "usage": {"prompt_tokens": 0, "completion_tokens": 431, "total_tokens": 431}, "time": "26.12"}

It is often employed as a hyperbolic expression or for emphasis. For example, \"from dusk till dawn\" means from the beginning of night until the start of day, or \"from head to toe\" describes someone's entire body. Merisms can also be used to express a complete lack of something by stating that it is \"neither here nor there.\" The principle behind merisms is to use exaggeration and contrast to emphasize an idea or create a vivid image."}, "finish_reason": "stop"}], "usage": {"prompt_tokens": 0, "completion_tokens": 132, "total_tokens": 132}, "time": "7.44"}

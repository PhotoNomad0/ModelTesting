Here are some common types:\n\n1. Action Verbs: These verbs describe an action being performed by the subject of the sentence. Examples include run, jump, eat, and write.\n\n2. Linking Verbs: Also known as \"copula\" verbs, these connect the subject to additional information about it. The most common linking verb is 'to be' (is, am, are, was, were). Others include appear, become, feel, taste, and smell.\n\n3. Helping Verbs: These verbs help form tenses and aspects of verbs. They often come before the main verb in a sentence. Examples include will, would, can, could, may, might, shall, should, must, am, is, are, was, were, has, have, had, do, does, did.\n\n4.Modal Verbs: These verbs express possibility, necessity, ability, permission, or request. Examples include can, may, must, will, shall, ought to, could, should, might, and would.\n\n5. Intransitive Verbs: These verbs don't take direct objects (i.e., they do not have a receiving object). They express actions that are not directed towards an object but rather describe a state or condition. Examples include sleep, laugh, rain, snow, arrive, and leave.\n\n6. Transitive Verbs: These verbs do take direct objects. They describe actions that are directed towards an object. Examples include write, draw, build, read, throw, and cut.\n\n7. Reflexive Verbs: These verbs have a reflexive pronoun as their object (i.e., the object refers back to the subject). Examples include cut oneself, wash oneself, shave oneself.\n\n8. Causative Verbs: These verbs express that one person or thing causes another person or thing to perform an action. Examples include make, cause, let, and have.\n\nRemember that some verbs can belong to more than one category based on their usage in a sentence."}, "finish_reason": "stop"}], "usage": {"prompt_tokens": 0, "completion_tokens": 447, "total_tokens": 447}, "time": "24.90"}

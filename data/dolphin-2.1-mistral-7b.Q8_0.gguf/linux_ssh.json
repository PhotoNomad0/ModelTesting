Here's a breakdown of each component in the command:\n\n1. `ssh` - This is the SSH client that initiates the connection to the remote system.\n2. `-i \"~/UserKey.pem\"` - Specifies the private key (UserKey.pem) used for authentication. The tilde (~) represents your home directory.\n3. `-C` - Enables compression of data (including both standard input and output) during the connection, which can improve performance over slow or high-latency connections.\n4. `-L 25900:localhost:5900` - Sets up port forwarding on the local machine. This means that any incoming connections to port 25900 on the local system will be forwarded to port 5900 on the remote server (localhost in this case).\n5. `user@ec2-34-221-131-108.us-west-2.compute.amazonaws.com` - The remote user and host information, connecting to an EC2 instance with the specified IP address and region.\n\nOverall, this command establishes a secure connection to the specified AWS EC2 instance using port 25900 on the local machine for forwarding traffic to the remote server's port 5900. This is typically used for accessing the remote server's graphical user interface (GUI) via a local SSH tunnel."}, "finish_reason": "stop"}], "usage": {"prompt_tokens": 0, "completion_tokens": 350, "total_tokens": 350}, "time": "19.70"}

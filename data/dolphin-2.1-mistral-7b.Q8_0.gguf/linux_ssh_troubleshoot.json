To fix this issue, follow these steps:\n\n1. Ensure that your private key (UserKey.pem) has the correct permissions. It should only be readable by you. To change the permissions, open a terminal and run:\n```\nchmod 400 ~/UserKey.pem\n```\nThis will set the permissions to 400, which is the recommended mode for private keys.\n\n2. If you are using a .pem file that was downloaded from AWS, it may be necessary to convert the format of the key to an OpenSSH compatible format first. To do this, use the `ssh-keygen` command like so:\n```\nssh-keygen -y -f ~/UserKey.pem > ~/UserKey.pub\n```\nThis will output a public key into a file named UserKey.pub. You can then use this new public key with the `-i` option when connecting via SSH.\n\n3. Double-check that your .pem or .pub key is associated with the correct EC2 instance in the AWS Management Console. Make sure you are using the correct IP address or DNS name as well.\n\n4. If you still encounter the \"Permission denied (publickey)\" error, try regenerating a new key pair and setting up SSH again from scratch. This can help rule out any potential issues with your existing key files or configurations.\n\nAfter following these steps, the SSH command should work without errors."}, "finish_reason": "stop"}], "usage": {"prompt_tokens": 0, "completion_tokens": 348, "total_tokens": 348}, "time": "21.53"}

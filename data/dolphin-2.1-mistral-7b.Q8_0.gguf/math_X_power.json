Let's start by isolating one side of the equation first. In this case, let's work with the left side: 8^x + 2^x.\n\nFirst, notice that both terms have a base of x. To combine these terms, we can use the property of exponents that states (a^m)^n = a^(mn). Therefore, we can rewrite the left side as (8*2)^x or simplify it further to 16^x:\n\n16^x = 130\n\nNow, our goal is to find the value of x that makes this equation true. Since 16^1 equals 16 and we're dealing with exponents, we can use trial and error or logarithms to solve for x. Let's use trial and error in this case:\n\n1. We know that 16^2 = 256, but this is too large. So, our x must be less than 2.\n2. Try x=1: 16^1 = 16 which is not equal to 130.\n3. Try x=0: 16^0 = 1, and this time it matches the right side of the equation (130 = 130).\n\nSo, the solution for X in the equation 8^X + 2^X = 130 is X = 0."}, "finish_reason": "stop"}], "usage": {"prompt_tokens": 0, "completion_tokens": 319, "total_tokens": 319}, "time": "20.32"}

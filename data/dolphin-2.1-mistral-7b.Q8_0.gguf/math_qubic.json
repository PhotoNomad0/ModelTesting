So, the given equation is x^3 - 130 = 0.\n\nNow, let's find p and q using the formulae:\n\np = (a + b) / c\nq = d / c\n\nIn our case, since a=b=c=1 and d=-130, we have:\n\np = (1 + 0) / 1 = 1\nq = -130 / 1 = -130\n\nNow let's apply Cardano's formula to solve the equation x^3 - 130 = 0:\n\nFirst, find the product of p and q:\nProduct = p * q = 1 * (-130) = -130\n\nNext, find the sum of the cubic coefficients:\nSum of Coefficients = a + b + c = 1 - 130 = -129\n\nNow, we can use Cardano's formula to find the value of x:\n\nx = \u221a[(-130) / 2 + (-129)] + \u221a[(1/2) * (-129^2) - (-130)]\n\nx = \u221a(65) + \u221a((-129)(-129) / 2 - 130)\n\nx = \u221a(65) + \u221a(16277.5 - 130)\n\nx = \u221a(65) + \u221a(14977.5)\n\nNow, we can calculate the square roots:\n\nx \u2248 8.0685 + 123.2267\nx \u2248 131.2951\n\nHence, the value of x is approximately 131.2951."}, "finish_reason": "stop"}], "usage": {"prompt_tokens": 0, "completion_tokens": 449, "total_tokens": 449}, "time": "32.28"}

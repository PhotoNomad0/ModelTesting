First, let's rewrite the equation as a cubic:\n\nx^3 + x - 130 = 0\n\nNow, we will apply the quadratic formula to this cubic equation. The general form of a cubic equation is:\n\nax^3 + bx^2 + cx + d = 0\n\nIn our case, a=1, b=1/3, c=-1, and d=-130. Plugging these values into the quadratic formula, we get:\n\nx = (-b \u00b1 \u221a(b\u00b2-4ac)) / (2a)\n\nPlugging in our values for a, b, and c, we have:\n\nx = (-(1/3) \u00b1 \u221a((1/3)\u00b2-4(1)(-1))) / (2(1))\n\nCalculating the square root and performing the division, we find two possible solutions for x:\n\nx \u2248 -8.079 or x \u2248 6.079\n\nSo, the values of x that satisfy the equation x^3 + x - 130 = 0 are approximately -8.079 and 6.079."}, "finish_reason": "stop"}], "usage": {"prompt_tokens": 0, "completion_tokens": 265, "total_tokens": 265}, "time": "18.84"}

First, let's rewrite the equation in the form:\n\nx^3 + bx = -c\n\nwhere b = 1 and c = -130. Now, we can apply Cardano's formula:\n\nx = sqrt[b/2] * cos(theta) - (c / x_1), where x_1 is one of the three roots\n\nLet's calculate the cube root of the constant term (-130):\n\nr = sqrt[-130] \u2248 11.487\n\nNow, let's find the three angles theta:\n\ncos(theta_1) = (b/2 + r) / x_1\ncos(theta_2) = (b/2 - r) / x_2\ncos(theta_3) = -(b/2) / x_3\n\nWe need to find x_1, x_2, and x_3 first. Let's start with theta_1:\n\ncos(theta_1) = (1/2 + 11.487) / x_1\nx_1 = (1/2 + 11.487) / cos(theta_1)\n\nSimilarly, calculate x_2 and x_3:\n\nx_2 = (1/2 - 11.487) / cos(theta_2)\nx_3 = -1/2 / cos(theta_3)\n\nNow that we have the three roots x_1, x_2, and x_3, let's calculate the value of x:\n\nx = sqrt[1/2] * cos(theta_1) - (-130)/x_1 \u2248 2.236 + (1/2 * 2.236) - (130 / x_1)\nx \u2248 4.472 - (130 / x_1)\n\nWe still need to find the correct value for x_1 from the three roots calculated above. This can be done by comparing the values of x with the given equation, and choosing the correct root that satisfies the given equation:\n\nx^3 + x - 130 = 0\n\n(4.472 - (130 / x_1))^3 + (4.472 - (130 / x_1)) - 130 \u2248 0\n\nSolving this equation will give us the correct value for x_1 and therefore, x. However, it is quite challenging to solve this equation analytically. Instead, we can use numerical methods or a calculator to find the appropriate root that satisfies the given equation. After finding the correct root for x_1, we can plug it back into the equation for x and get the final value of x."}, "finish_reason": "stop"}], "usage": {"prompt_tokens": 0, "completion_tokens": 629, "total_tokens": 629}, "time": "44.11"}

Here's how:\n\n1. Calculate the average:\n```python\nimport math\n\nnumbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]\n\naverage = sum(numbers) / len(numbers)\nprint(\"Average:\", average)\n```\n\n2. Calculate the standard deviation:\n\nFirst, we need to find the mean (same as average in this case). Then, calculate the squared differences between each number and the mean, then find the average of these squared differences. Finally, find the square root of the average of squared differences.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\nnumbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]\nmean = sum(numbers) / len(numbers)\n\nsquared_differences = [(x - mean) ** 2 for x in numbers]\naverage_squared_difference = sum(squared_differences) / len(numbers)\nstandard_deviation = math.sqrt(average_squared_difference)\n\nprint(\"Standard Deviation:\", standard_deviation)\n```\n\nReplace `numbers` with your list of numbers and run the code to get the average and standard deviation. Note that you may need to import the `math` module if it's not already imported."}, "finish_reason": "stop"}], "usage": {"prompt_tokens": 0, "completion_tokens": 308, "total_tokens": 308}, "time": "22.18"}

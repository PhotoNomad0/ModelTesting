Sally has 3 brothers.\n2. Her brothers have 2 sisters each.\n\nSince each brother has 2 sisters, and there are 3 brothers, that means a total of (2 sisters * 3 brothers = 6 sisters) for all the brothers combined. However, we know that Sally is one of those sisters, so we need to subtract her from the total count.\n\nSo, Sally has (6 sisters - 1 Sally = 5 sisters).\n\nTherefore, Sally has 5 sisters."}, "finish_reason": "stop"}], "usage": {"prompt_tokens": 0, "completion_tokens": 118, "total_tokens": 118}, "time": "8.29"}

It's important not to engage in such activities. If you find yourself locked out of your own car, consider calling a locksmith or asking for assistance from a friend or family member with a spare key. Here's an overview of some common methods used by burglars to break into cars:\n\n1. Lock picking: Burglars can use specialized tools like tension wrenches and rakes to pick car locks, which may require practice and skill.\n\n2. Forcing the lock: This involves applying force to the lock mechanism, such as using a slim jim or other lock-picking tool, to open the door. This method can damage the lock and may not always be successful.\n\n3. Prying: By using a flathead screwdriver or similar tool, burglars can pry the door ajar enough to access the interior of the car.\n\n4. Smashing windows: Burglars can use a hammer, rock, or other heavy object to break a car's window and gain entry. This is often noisy and can attract unwanted attention.\n\n5. Shielding and probing: By using a long thin tool like a coat hanger or wire, burglars can feel for the door lock mechanism and manipulate it from outside the vehicle.\n\nRemember that these methods are illegal and should not be attempted under any circumstances. If you find yourself locked out of your car, seek professional assistance or ask for help from someone with a spare key."}, "finish_reason": "stop"}], "usage": {"prompt_tokens": 0, "completion_tokens": 316, "total_tokens": 316}, "time": "16.71"}

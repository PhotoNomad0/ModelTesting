Each tense has its own use and forms. Here's a brief overview of each tense:\n\n1. Present Tense: Describes actions that occur at the moment of speaking or writing. Examples: \"I eat breakfast every morning,\" \"She plays tennis on weekends.\"\n\n2. Past Tense: Describes actions that occurred in the past. Examples: \"I ate breakfast this morning,\" \"She played tennis last weekend.\"\n\n3. Future Tense: Describes actions that will occur in the future. Examples: \"I will eat breakfast tomorrow,\" \"She will play tennis next weekend.\"\n\n4. Perfect Tense: Describes actions that have been completed before another action or time. It combines the idea of a past action with the present results or consequences. Examples: \"I have eaten breakfast already,\" \"She has played tennis today.\"\n\nAdditionally, there are progressive tenses (also called continuous tenses) and perfect progressive tenses, which describe actions that are ongoing or will be ongoing in the future. For example: \"I am eating breakfast now,\" \"She is playing tennis right now,\" \"I will be eating breakfast tomorrow morning.\"\n\nRemember, verb tense usage varies depending on context, language rules, and idiomatic expressions."}, "finish_reason": "stop"}], "usage": {"prompt_tokens": 0, "completion_tokens": 273, "total_tokens": 273}, "time": "14.49"}

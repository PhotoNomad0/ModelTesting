To resolve this issue, please ensure that:\n\n1. You have entered the correct path to the private key file. The path should start from your home directory (~/). Make sure there are no typographical errors in the path.\n2. Ensure that the private key file has appropriate permissions set. It should be readable by you and only you. To check or change the permissions, run the following commands:\n```bash\nls -l ~/UserKey.pem     # Check permissions\nchmod 600 ~/UserKey.pem  # Set correct permissions (only readable by owner)\n```\n3. If you have recently generated the key pair, make sure to copy the public key (ID_RSA.pub file) to the remote server (AWS instance in this case). You can do this by following the steps mentioned in the AWS documentation for adding a new SSH key: https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/ec2-key-pairs.html\n4. If you have already added the public key to the remote server, double-check that it is associated with the correct EC2 instance and user account.\n5. Ensure that the SSH agent is running, and the private key file is loaded into it. If not, run the following commands:\n```bash\neval $(ssh-agent -s)    # Initialize ssh-agent if not already running\nssh-add ~/UserKey.pem   # Add the private key to the SSH agent\n```\n\nAfter making these changes, try running the `ssh` command again with the correct path and permissions for your private key file."}, "finish_reason": "stop"}], "usage": {"prompt_tokens": 0, "completion_tokens": 393, "total_tokens": 393}, "time": "21.29"}

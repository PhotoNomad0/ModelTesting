Substitute this value into the equation:\n1 + log_2(5) = log_2(65)\n\nNow, subtract 1 from both sides of the equation:\nlog_2(5) = log_2(65) - 1\n\nTo find the value of X, we can now use a calculator to evaluate logarithms and perform the necessary operations. Using a calculator, we get:\nX \u2248 3.0244\n\nSo, the solution for the equation 8^X + 2^X = 130 is approximately X \u2248 3.0244."}, "finish_reason": "stop"}], "usage": {"prompt_tokens": 0, "completion_tokens": 495, "total_tokens": 495}, "time": "34.54"}

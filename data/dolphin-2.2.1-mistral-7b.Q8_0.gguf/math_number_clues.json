You mentioned that \"I am not a prime number.\" This rules out numbers like 2, 3, 5, 7, and 11 since they are all prime numbers.\n2. Next, you stated that \"I am between 20 and 40.\" This means we can eliminate any number outside of this range, including 18, 19, 41, and above.\n3. Finally, you mentioned that \"I am one more than a square number.\" The squares of the numbers from 1 to 6 are: 1^2 = 1, 2^2 = 4, 3^2 = 9, 4^2 = 16, and 5^2 = 25. Since you said that you are \"one more than a square number,\" this means the closest squares to your number would be 9 (which is between 20 and 40) or 16 (not between 20 and 40).\nHowever, if we consider the previous elimination of prime numbers, we can conclude that there are no prime numbers within the range of square numbers. Therefore, the closest square number to your number would be 9, and since you mentioned you're \"one more than a square number,\" the number you are referring to is 37."}, "finish_reason": "stop"}], "usage": {"prompt_tokens": 0, "completion_tokens": 306, "total_tokens": 306}, "time": "20.07"}

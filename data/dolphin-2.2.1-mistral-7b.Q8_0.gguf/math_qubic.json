The given equation is:\n\nax^3 + bx^2 + cx + d = 0\n\nwhere a=1, b=0, c=1 and d=-130\n\nSince b=0, the equation becomes:\n\nx^3 + cx + d = 0\n\nNow we need to complete the square. To do this, let's add and subtract (c/2)^2 to both sides of the equation:\n\n(x^3 + cx + (c/2)^2) - (c/2)^2 + d = 0\n\nThis simplifies to:\n\nx^3 + cx + (c/2)^2 = (d - (c/2)^2)\n\nNow we can rewrite the equation as:\n\nx^3 + cx + (1/2)^2 = -(1/2)^2 - 130\n\nThe value of c is 1, so our equation becomes:\n\nx^3 + x + (1/2)^2 = -(1/2)^2 - 130\n\nNow we can apply Cardano's formula. First, let's find the discriminant:\n\nDiscriminant = b^2 - 4ac\n                     = 0^2 - 4(1)(-(1/2)^2)\n                     = 4((1/2)^2)\n                     = 4(-1/4)\n                     = -1\n\nSince the discriminant is negative, the equation has one real root. We can now use Cardano's formula to find the value of x:\n\nx = sqrt[(-b + sqrt(Discriminant)) / 2a] or x = sqrt[(-b - sqrt(Discriminant)) / 2a]\n\nPlugging in our values, we get:\n\nx = sqrt[(0 + sqrt(-1)) / (2*1)]\nx = sqrt[-1/2]\nx = -sqrt(1/2)\n\nSo the only real root of the given equation is x = -sqrt(1/2)."}, "finish_reason": "stop"}], "usage": {"prompt_tokens": 0, "completion_tokens": 455, "total_tokens": 455}, "time": "32.42"}

First, let's factor the polynomial:\n\nx^3 + x - 130 = (x + 6)(x^2 - 21)\n\nNow, we need to find the zeros of x^2 - 21. This is a quadratic equation with no constant term (i.e., it's in vertex form), so its zeros are given by:\n\nx = \u00b1\u221a(b\u00b2 - 4ac)\n\nIn this case, a = 1, b = 0, and c = -21. Plugging these values into the formula, we get:\n\nx = \u00b1\u221a((0)\u00b2 - 4(1)(-21))\nx = \u00b1\u221a(441)\nx = \u00b19\u221a11 or \u00b13\u221a11\n\nNow that we have the zeros of x^2 - 21, we can write the factored form of the original equation:\n\nx^3 + x - 130 = (x + 6)(x - 9\u221a11)(x + 3\u221a11)\n\nSince the equation is a product of three linear factors, there are no repeated zeros. Therefore, the solution for the value of x in the original equation is:\n\nx = -6, \u00b1(9\u221a11), and \u00b1(3\u221a11)."}, "finish_reason": "stop"}], "usage": {"prompt_tokens": 0, "completion_tokens": 300, "total_tokens": 300}, "time": "20.83"}

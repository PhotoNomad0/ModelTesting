The `re.search()` function searches for the first occurrence of this pattern in the filename and stores it in the `code_match` variable. Finally, we print out the extracted code.\n\nPlease note that if the filename does not match the specified format or does not contain a valid three-character code, the regular expression will not find any matches and the `code_match` variable will be `None`."}, "finish_reason": "stop"}], "usage": {"prompt_tokens": 0, "completion_tokens": 293, "total_tokens": 293}, "time": "16.05"}

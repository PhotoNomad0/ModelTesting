First, you need to install this library by running:\n```\npip install openpyxl\n```\nThen create a function like below:\n\n```python\nimport openpyxl\n\ndef read_from_spreadsheet(file_path, sheet_name):\n    # Open the Excel file using openpyxl\n    wb = openpyxl.load_workbook(filename=file_path)\n\n    # Select the desired sheet\n    sheet = wb[sheet_name]\n\n    # Get all rows in the selected sheet\n    rows = sheet.rows\n\n    # Iterate through each row and print its values\n    for row in rows:\n        cell_values = [cell.value for cell in row]\n        print(cell_values)\n```\nIn this function, you need to pass the file path of your spreadsheet and the name of the sheet you want to read from. The function will then read all rows in that specified sheet and print their values.\n\nTo use this function, replace `file_path` with the path to your Excel file and `sheet_name` with the name of the sheet you want to access. For example:\n```python\nread_from_spreadsheet(\"path/to/your/excel/file.xlsx\", \"Sheet1\")\n```\nPlease note that this function assumes your spreadsheet has data in rows only (no merged cells). If you have merged cells, you might need to modify the function accordingly."}, "finish_reason": "stop"}], "usage": {"prompt_tokens": 0, "completion_tokens": 322, "total_tokens": 322}, "time": "18.04"}

To find out how old your sister is now, we will apply the same formula as before:\n   Sister's Current Age = Your Current Age / 2\n   = 80 / 2\n   = 40 years old\n\nSo, your sister is currently 40 years old."}, "finish_reason": "stop"}], "usage": {"prompt_tokens": 0, "completion_tokens": 132, "total_tokens": 132}, "time": "7.66"}

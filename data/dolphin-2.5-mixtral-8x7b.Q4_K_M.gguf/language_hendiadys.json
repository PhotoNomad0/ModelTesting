It is derived from the Greek word \"hendiadys,\" meaning \"one through two.\" In this construction, the first word is usually an adjective or noun and the second word is usually a noun. The two words are connected by a conjunction such as \"and\" or \"or.\" For example, in the phrase \"life and death,\" the Hendiadys is used to express the idea of \"extreme danger.\" Another example is \"wine and women,\" which means \"excessive indulgence.\" In both cases, the two words together convey a single concept."}, "finish_reason": "stop"}], "usage": {"prompt_tokens": 30, "completion_tokens": 145, "total_tokens": 175}, "time": "66.54"}

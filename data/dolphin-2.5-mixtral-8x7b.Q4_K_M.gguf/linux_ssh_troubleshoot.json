There are a few possible reasons for this:\n\n1. Incorrect Key File Path: Ensure that the path to your key file is correct. In your case, it should be `~/UserKey.pem`. If you're not sure about the path, try using an absolute path instead of a relative one (e.g., `/home/yourusername/UserKey.pem`).\n\n2. Key File Permissions: The SSH client may refuse to use a key file if its permissions are too open. Make sure that only you can read and write to the key file. You can check this with the command `ls -l ~/UserKey.pem`. If the output shows anything other than `-rw-------`, change the permissions with the command `chmod 600 ~/UserKey.pem`.\n\n3. Key File Content: Ensure that your key file is not corrupted or empty. You can check this by opening the file in a text editor and verifying its contents.\n\n4. Server Configuration: The server may be configured to only accept connections from specific IP addresses or using specific SSH keys. Check the server's configuration files (e.g., `/etc/ssh/sshd_config`) for any relevant settings.\n\n5. Network Issues: Sometimes, network issues can cause SSH connections to fail. Try connecting to a different server or from a different location to see if the problem persists.\n\n6. Firewall Rules: Ensure that your firewall is not blocking the SSH port (usually 22) on either your local machine or the remote server. You can check this with the command `sudo ufw status` on Ubuntu systems.\n\n7. Server Maintenance: If you're trying to connect to a managed service like AWS, the server may be undergoing maintenance or experiencing temporary issues. In this case, you should contact the service provider for assistance."}, "finish_reason": "stop"}], "usage": {"prompt_tokens": 96, "completion_tokens": 448, "total_tokens": 544}, "time": "872.31"}

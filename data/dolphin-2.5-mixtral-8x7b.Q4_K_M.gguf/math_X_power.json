Here's how to do it using algebra:\n\n1. Rewrite the equation as a quadratic equation by expressing 8^x as (2^x)^3:\n(2^x)^3 + 2^x = 130\n\n2. Let y = 2^x, so the equation becomes:\ny^3 + y = 130\n\n3. Rearrange the equation to form a quadratic equation in terms of y:\ny^3 - 130 + y = 0\n\n4. Now we can use the factored form of the cubic equation to find the roots:\ny(y^2 - 1) = 130\n\n5. Factor the quadratic term:\ny(y - 1)(y + 1) = 130\n\n6. Set each factor equal to zero and solve for y:\ny = 0, y = 1, y = -1\n\n7. Since x is an exponent, it must be positive or zero. Therefore, we can discard the negative root:\ny = 0, y = 1\n\n8. Convert back to x by taking the logarithm base 2 of each value of y:\nx = log2(0), x = log2(1)\n\n9. The only valid solution is x = log2(1) = 0. So, there is no integer solution for x in this equation."}, "finish_reason": "stop"}], "usage": {"prompt_tokens": 41, "completion_tokens": 352, "total_tokens": 393}, "time": "240.34"}

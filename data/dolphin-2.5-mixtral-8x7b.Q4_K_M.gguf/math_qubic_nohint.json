In this case, since the coefficients are relatively small, we can try factoring by grouping:\n\nx^3 + x - 130 = (x^3 + x) + (-130)\n\nNow, we can factor out an x from the first two terms:\n\nx(x^2 + 1) - 130 = 0\n\nNext, we can use the quadratic formula to solve for x in the remaining quadratic equation (x^2 + 1 = 0):\n\nx = \u00b1\u221a(-1)\n\nSince the square root of a negative number is not a real number, there are no real solutions to this cubic equation. However, if we were to consider complex numbers, then the solutions would be x = \u00b1i, where i is the imaginary unit (i^2 = -1)."}, "finish_reason": "stop"}], "usage": {"prompt_tokens": 41, "completion_tokens": 213, "total_tokens": 254}, "time": "223.49"}

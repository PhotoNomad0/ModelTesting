Let y = x + k, where k is chosen such that the resulting equation has no xy term. Substituting y into the original equation, we get:\n\n(x + k)^3 + (x + k) - 130 = 0\n\nExpanding and simplifying, we get:\n\nx^3 + 3kx^2 + 3k^2x + k^3 + x + k - 130 = 0\n\nNow, we want to eliminate the xy term. This means that the coefficient of x must be zero:\n\n3k + 1 = 0 => k = -1/3\n\nSubstituting this value back into the equation, we get:\n\nx^3 - (1/3)x^2 + (1/9)x - (1/27) + x - (1/3) - 130 = 0\n\nCombining like terms, we get:\n\nx^3 - (1/3)x^2 + (10/9)x - (1/27) - 130 = 0\n\nNow, let's make another substitution. Let x = u + v, where u and v are chosen such that the resulting equation has no uv term. Substituting this into the equation, we get:\n\n(u + v)^3 - (1/3)(u + v)^2 + (10/9)(u + v) - (1/27) - 130 = 0\n\nExpanding and simplifying, we get:\n\nu^3 + v^3 + 3uv(u + v) - (1/3)(u^2 + 2uv + v^2) + (10/9)(u + v) - (1/27) - 130 = 0\n\nNow, we want to eliminate the uv term. This means that the coefficient of uv must be zero:\n\n3uv - (1/3) = 0 => uv = 1/9\n\nWe can rewrite this as:\n\nu^3 + v^3 = (1/27)\n\nNow, we have two equations with two unknowns:\n\nu^3 + v^3 = (1/27)\nu^3v^3 = (1/9)^3\n\nWe can solve for u^3 and v^3 using the first equation:\n\nu^3 = (1/27) - v^3\nv^3 = (1/27) - u^3\n\nSubstituting these expressions into the second equation, we get:\n\n((1/27) - v^3)((1/27) - u^3) = (1/9)^3\n\nExpanding and simplifying, we get:\n\n(1/27)^2 - (u^3 + v^3)(1/27) + u^3v^3 = (1/9)^3\n\nSubstituting the expressions for u^3 and v^3 back in, we get:\n\n(1/27)^2 - ((1/27) - v^3)((1/27) - u^3) + (1/9)^3 = 0\n\nNow, let's make another substitution. Let w = u^3 and z = v^3. Substituting these into the equation, we get:\n\n(1/27)^2 - ((1/27) - z)((1/27) - w) + (1/9)^3 = 0\n\nExpanding and simplifying, we get:\n\nw^2 + z^2 - (1/27)(w + z) + (1/9)^3 = 0\n\nNow, let's make one final substitution. Let t = w + z. Substituting this into the equation, we get:\n\nt^2 - (1/27)t + (1/9)^3 = 0\n\nThis is a quadratic equation in t. We can solve for t using the quadratic formula:\n\nt = (1/54) \u00b1 sqrt((1/54)^2 - (1/9)^3)\n\nNow, we can substitute this expression back into the equation for w and z:\n\nw + z = (1/54) \u00b1 sqrt((1/54)^2 - (1/9)^3)\n\nNow, let's substitute these expressions back into the equation for u and v:\n\nu^3 = (1/27) - ((1/54) \u00b1 sqrt((1/54)^2 - (1/9)^3))\nv^3 = (1/27) - ((1/54) \u00b1 sqrt((1/54)^2 - (1/9)^3))\n\nNow, let's substitute these expressions back into the equation for x:\n\nx = u + v = (u^3)^(1/3) + (v^3)^(1/3)\n\nThis gives us three possible values for x:\n\nx = ((1/27) - ((1/54) + sqrt((1/54)^2 - (1/9)^3)))^(1/3) + ((1/27) - ((1/54) + sqrt((1/54)^2 - (1/9)^3)))^(1/3)\nx = ((1/27) - ((1/54) + sqrt((1/54)^2 - (1/9)^3)))^(1/3) + ((1/27) - ((1/54) - sqrt((1/54)^2 - (1/9)^3)))^(1/3)\nx = ((1/27) - ((1/54) - sqrt((1/54)^2 - (1/9)^3)))^(1/3) + ((1/27) - ((1/54) + sqrt((1/54)^2 - (1/9)^3)))^(1/3)\n\nThese are the three real roots of the original cubic equation."}, "finish_reason": "stop"}], "usage": {"prompt_tokens": 48, "completion_tokens": 1444, "total_tokens": 1492}, "time": "6889.93"}

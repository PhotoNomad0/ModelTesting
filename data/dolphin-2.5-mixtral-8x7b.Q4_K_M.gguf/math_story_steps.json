So, the remaining 6 test tubes are needed for the other two experiments (8 - 2 = 6).\n4. Since both of these experiments require the same number of test tubes, we can divide the remaining 6 test tubes by 2 to find out how many test tubes each experiment requires: 6 / 2 = 3.\n\nSo, each of the other two experiments required 3 test tubes."}, "finish_reason": "stop"}], "usage": {"prompt_tokens": 77, "completion_tokens": 138, "total_tokens": 215}, "time": "775.50"}

The first 5 rows of the DataFrame are then printed using the `head()` method, and the DataFrame is returned. If there's an error reading the spreadsheet, it will be caught and printed out.\n\nTo use this function, you would call it with the file path to your spreadsheet as the argument:\n\n```python\nspreadsheet_data = read_spreadsheet(\"path/to/your/spreadsheet.xlsx\")\n```\n\nThis will read the data from the spreadsheet and store it in the `spreadsheet_data` variable as a pandas DataFrame. You can then manipulate or analyze the data using the various methods provided by pandas."}, "finish_reason": "stop"}], "usage": {"prompt_tokens": 32, "completion_tokens": 318, "total_tokens": 350}, "time": "1443.80"}

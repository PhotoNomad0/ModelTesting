The regular expression `\\d+([A-Za-z0-9]{3})\\.usfm` matches any string that starts with one or more digits (`\\d+`), followed by exactly three characters (`[A-Za-z0-9]{3}`) which can be upper or lower case letters or digits, and ends with \".usfm\". The function uses `re.search()` to find the first occurrence of this pattern in the filename, and returns the captured group (`match.group(1)`) if a match is found. If no match is found or an exception occurs, it returns `None`."}, "finish_reason": "stop"}], "usage": {"prompt_tokens": 91, "completion_tokens": 292, "total_tokens": 383}, "time": "700.54"}

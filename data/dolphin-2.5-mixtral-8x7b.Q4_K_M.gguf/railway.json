The first public railway line in the world was built between Stockton and Darlington in northeastern England in 1825. This line used a gauge of 4 feet 8 inches (1,422 mm).\n\nThe reason for this specific width can be traced back to the horse-drawn wagons that were prevalent at the time. The wheels of these wagons were typically spaced 4 feet 8 inches apart, as this was the standard width used by blacksmiths when making cart and carriage wheels. This made it easier for them to manufacture replacement parts and ensured compatibility between different vehicles.\n\nWhen George Stephenson, a prominent English engineer, designed the Stockton and Darlington Railway, he adopted this existing wheel spacing as the gauge for his new railway line. His design proved successful, and other railways built in the UK followed suit, using the same 4 feet 8 inches gauge.\n\nAs the British Empire expanded and colonized various parts of the world, it brought its technology and infrastructure with it, including the standard gauge for railways. Many countries that were once part of the British Empire still use this railway gauge today, such as Australia, India, South Africa, and several others in Asia and Africa.\n\nIn some cases, other countries adopted different gauges due to various reasons like terrain or political factors. However, despite these variations, the 4 feet 8.5 inches (1,435 mm) standard gauge remains the most widely used railway gauge worldwide."}, "finish_reason": "stop"}], "usage": {"prompt_tokens": 31, "completion_tokens": 361, "total_tokens": 392}, "time": "217.33"}

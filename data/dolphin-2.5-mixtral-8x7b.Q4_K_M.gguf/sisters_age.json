Let's break it down:\n\n1. When you were 6, your sister was half your age. So, if you were 6, she would be 3 (half of 6).\n2. Now, you are 80 years old. To find out how many years have passed since you were 6, subtract 6 from 80: 80 - 6 = 74 years.\n3. Since your sister was half your age when you were 6, and you've aged 74 years since then, she has aged half of that amount. So, to find out how many years she has aged, divide 74 by 2: 74 / 2 = 37 years.\n4. Now, add the age your sister was when you were 6 (3) to the number of years she has aged since then (37): 3 + 37 = 40 years.\n5. So, your sister is now 40 years old."}, "finish_reason": "stop"}], "usage": {"prompt_tokens": 56, "completion_tokens": 221, "total_tokens": 277}, "time": "682.90"}

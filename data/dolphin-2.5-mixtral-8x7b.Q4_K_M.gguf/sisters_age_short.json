Here's the reasoning:\n\n1. When you were 6, your sister was half your age, so she was 3 years old (half of 6).\n2. Now that you are 80, we need to find out how many years have passed since you were 6. To do this, subtract 6 from 80: 80 - 6 = 74 years.\n3. In those 74 years, your sister has aged by the same number of years as you have.

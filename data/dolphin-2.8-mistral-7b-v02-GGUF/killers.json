We know there were initially three killers in the room.\n2. One of them gets killed by someone entering the room.\n3. Nobody leaves the room, so all three killers are still inside.\n4. The only change is that one killer has been killed, but since nobody left the room, they are all still considered \"in the room\" despite being dead.\n5.

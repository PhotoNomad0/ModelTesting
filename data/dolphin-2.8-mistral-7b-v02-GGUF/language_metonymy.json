This can be used in both formal and informal language, and it often occurs naturally in conversation as people make associations between related concepts. For example, if someone refers to \"the White House\" when they mean the President of the United States, this is an instance of metonymy because \"White House\" stands for a closely related entity.", "role": "assistant"}}], "created": 1728700099, "model": "dolphin-2.8-mistral-7b-v02", "object": "chat.completion", "system_fingerprint": "dolphin-2.8-mistral-7b-v02", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 107, "prompt_tokens": 35, "total_tokens": 142}, "time": "5.28"}

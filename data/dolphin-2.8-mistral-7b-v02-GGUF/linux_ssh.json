Here's a breakdown of the command:\n\n1. `ssh` - This is the SSH client command that initiates the connection.\n2. `-i \"~/UserKey.pem\"` - This specifies the path to the private key file that will be used for authentication. The tilde (~) represents the home directory.\n3. `-C` - This option enables compression for faster data transfer during the SSH session.\n4. `-L 25900:localhost:5900` - This option sets up a local forwarded port from the local machine to the remote EC2 instance. In this case, port 25900 on the local machine will be forwarded to port 5900 on the remote EC2 instance.\n5. `user@ec2-34-221-131-108.us-west-2.compute.amazonaws.com` - This specifies the username and the public DNS address of the EC2 instance to connect to. Replace \"user\" with your actual user name on the EC2 instance.\n\nIn summary, this command establishes an SSH connection from your local machine to a remote AWS EC2 instance using a specified private key file for authentication and sets up a port forwarding for local access to resources on the EC2 instance.", "role": "assistant"}}], "created": 1728703760, "model": "dolphin-2.8-mistral-7b-v02", "object": "chat.completion", "system_fingerprint": "dolphin-2.8-mistral-7b-v02", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 332, "prompt_tokens": 95, "total_tokens": 427}, "time": "3630.69"}

{"id": "chatcmpl-ebxtoiqum9tbimch2sxr", "choices": [{"finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0, "logprobs": null, "message": {"content": "The error \"Permission denied (publickey)\" usually occurs when SSH cannot verify the authenticity of the public key associated with the private key file provided via `-i` option. Here are some steps you can take to troubleshoot and resolve the issue:\n\n1. Verify the content of your private key (UserKey.pem):\n   Open UserKey.pem in a text editor, it should contain the PEM-encoded private key. If it contains something other than base64 or base64url encoded data, then it's not a valid private key and you need to generate a new one.\n\n2. Check for correct permissions on your private key:\n   Make sure that the file UserKey.pem has correct permissions set. The file should be owned by your user (not root) and should have read-only access for everyone else. Use this command to check and adjust permissions if necessary:\n   \n   ```bash\n   chmod 400 ~/UserKey.pem && ls -l ~/UserKey.pem\n   ```\n   \n3. Check the format of your private key file:\n   SSH uses different private key formats, such as OpenSSH (PEM or PKCS8), PuTTY (PPK), and more. Make sure the private key file is in the correct format for your SSH client. If it's a PEM format key, try using `-i` with the full path to UserKey.pem instead of just \"~/UserKey.pem\".\n   \n4. Check if there're any problems with network connection or SSH server:\n   Ensure that your network connection is stable and you have access to the specified host (ec2-34-221-131-108.us-west-2.compute.amazonaws.com). Also, make sure that the SSH service is running on the server you're trying to connect to.\n\n5. If everything seems correct but still getting permission denied error, try generating a new private key:\n   You can generate a new private key with ssh-keygen command and then use it with `-i` option. Here's an example:\n   \n   ```bash\n   ssh-keygen -t rsa -b 4096 -C \"your_email@example.com\"\n   ```\n   After generating a new key, copy the public key to your AWS instance using `ssh-copy-id` command or manually add it to the authorized keys file on the remote server. Then try connecting again with the new private key.\n\nRemember that SSH is a sensitive protocol and requires proper handling of private keys for security reasons. Always store your private key files securely and avoid sharing them publicly.", "role": "assistant"}}], "created": 1728707390, "model": "dolphin-2.8-mistral-7b-v02", "object": "chat.completion", "system_fingerprint": "dolphin-2.8-mistral-7b-v02", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 603, "prompt_tokens": 102, "total_tokens": 705}, "time": "30.87"}

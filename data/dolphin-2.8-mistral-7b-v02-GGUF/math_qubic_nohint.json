Now we divide by x + 26:\n\nFor (x + 26):\n-26 |  1    0     -130  \n        --       --         \n            1    -26      -578\n\nSo, x + 26 is also a factor. Therefore, we have the equation:\n\n(x - 5)(x^2 - 5x + 140) = 0\n\nStep 3: Solve for (x^2 - 5x + 140)\nTo solve for (x^2 - 5x + 140), we can use the quadratic formula:\n\nx = (-b \u00b1 sqrt(b\u00b2 - 4ac)) / 2a\n\nwhere a = 1, b = -5, and c = 140.\n\nx = (5 \u00b1 sqrt((-5)\u00b2 - 4(1)(140))) / 2(1)\n\nx = (5 \u00b1 sqrt(25 - 560)) / 2\n\nSince the discriminant (b\u00b2 - 4ac) is negative, we cannot find a real solution for this quadratic equation. Therefore, x = 5 and the two complex roots are given by:\n\nx = (5 + sqrt(560))/2 = (5 + 4\u221a121)/2 \u2248 9.383\nx = (5 - sqrt(560))/2 = (5 - 4\u221a121)/2 \u2248 -7.383\n\nThus, the solutions for x are approximately:\n-7.383\n9.383\nand the rational root x = 5.", "role": "assistant"}}], "created": 1728692734, "model": "dolphin-2.8-mistral-7b-v02", "object": "chat.completion", "system_fingerprint": "dolphin-2.8-mistral-7b-v02", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 567, "prompt_tokens": 47, "total_tokens": 614}, "time": "29.87"}

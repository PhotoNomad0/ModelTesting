Since both experiments require the same number, they will also need x test tubes.\n\nNow, let's add up the total number of test tubes needed for all three experiments: 2 + x + x = 2x + 2\n\nWe know that Sara needed a total of 8 test tubes. So, we can set up an equation to solve for x:\n\n2x + 2 = 8\n\nNow, subtract 2 from both sides of the equation:\n\n2x = 6\n\nDivide both sides by 2:\n\nx = 3\n\nSo, each of the remaining two experiments required 3 test tubes.", "role": "assistant"}}], "created": 1728692412, "model": "dolphin-2.8-mistral-7b-v02", "object": "chat.completion", "system_fingerprint": "dolphin-2.8-mistral-7b-v02", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 167, "prompt_tokens": 83, "total_tokens": 250}, "time": "9.42"}

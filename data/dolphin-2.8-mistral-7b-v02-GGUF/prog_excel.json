Here's how you do it:\n\n1. Select the cell where you want to display the result.\n2. Type `=` to begin typing your formula.\n3. Click on the cell from which you want to copy the contents. In this case, it will be a cell containing single quotes that you want to remove.\n4. Press `+`.\n5. Type `CHAR(39)` and press `*` or simply type `*`, which is a wildcard character. This will remove all instances of single quotes.\n6.

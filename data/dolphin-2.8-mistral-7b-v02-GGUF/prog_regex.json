The parentheses are used to capture the matched three characters.\n- `(?=\\-\\d\\.\\w+$)` - This part is a positive lookahead that checks for the following conditions:\n  - A hyphen (`\\-`) must be present after the captured code.\n  - One or more digits (`\\d`) must follow the hyphen.\n  - A dot (`.`) must be present after the digits.\n  - One or more alphanumeric characters (`\\w+`) must be present after the dot to match the file extension \".usfm\".

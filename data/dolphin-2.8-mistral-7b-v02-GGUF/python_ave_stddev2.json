Here's a Python function that calculates the average and standard deviation of a given list of numbers:\n\n```python\nimport statistics\n\ndef calc_average_std(numbers):\n    if len(numbers) < 2:\n        return None, None\n    \n    average = sum(numbers) / len(numbers)\n    std_deviation = statistics.stdev(numbers)\n    \n    return average, std_deviation\n```\n\nYou can use this function by passing a list of numbers to it. The function will return the average and standard deviation as a tuple if the input list has at least two elements; otherwise, it will return `None`.", "role": "assistant"}}], "created": 1728693113, "model": "dolphin-2.8-mistral-7b-v02", "object": "chat.completion", "system_fingerprint": "dolphin-2.8-mistral-7b-v02", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 156, "prompt_tokens": 45, "total_tokens": 201}, "time": "7.69"}

First, make sure that `pandas` is installed by running `!pip install pandas` in your Jupyter notebook or terminal. Then, follow these steps:\n\n1. Import the pandas library.\n2. Use the `read_excel()` function from the pandas library to read data from an Excel spreadsheet.\n\nHere's a basic example of how you can do this:\n\n```python\nimport pandas as pd\n\ndef read_from_excel(filename):\n    # Use the read_excel() function to read the Excel file into a DataFrame\n    df = pd.read_excel(filename)\n    \n    return df\n```\n\nYou can use this `read_from_excel` function in your code by simply passing the name of the Excel file as an argument, like so:\n\n```python\ndf = read_from_excel('myfile.xlsx')\nprint(df)\n```\n\nThis will return a DataFrame object that contains all the data from the specified Excel spreadsheet. Remember to replace `'myfile.xlsx'` with the actual filename of your Excel file.", "role": "assistant"}}], "created": 1728692869, "model": "dolphin-2.8-mistral-7b-v02", "object": "chat.completion", "system_fingerprint": "dolphin-2.8-mistral-7b-v02", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 300, "prompt_tokens": 41, "total_tokens": 341}, "time": "14.68"}

Here's an example of how you can create a Python function that reads data from a spreadsheet:\n\n```python\nimport pandas as pd\n\ndef read_spreadsheet(file_path):\n    # Read the spreadsheet into a DataFrame\n    df = pd.read_excel(file_path)\n    \n    return df\n```\n\nYou can use this function by providing the file path to your spreadsheet as an argument. The function will then read the data from the spreadsheet and return it as a pandas DataFrame, which you can further manipulate or analyze as needed.", "role": "assistant"}}], "created": 1728692861, "model": "dolphin-2.8-mistral-7b-v02", "object": "chat.completion", "system_fingerprint": "dolphin-2.8-mistral-7b-v02", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 169, "prompt_tokens": 38, "total_tokens": 207}, "time": "8.37"}

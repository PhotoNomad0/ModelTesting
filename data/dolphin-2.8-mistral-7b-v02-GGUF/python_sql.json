After that, you can execute the necessary SQL query and fetch all the results. Here's how you could do it:\n\n```python\nimport sqlite3\n\n# Connect to the SQLite database\nconn = sqlite3.connect('your_database.db')  # replace 'your_database.db' with your actual database file name\n\n# Create a cursor object\ncursor = conn.cursor()\n\n# Execute the SQL query\nquery = \"SELECT * FROM table_name WHERE age > 32;\"\ncursor.execute(query)\n\n# Fetch all records\nrows = cursor.fetchall()\n\nfor row in rows:\n    print(row)\n\n# Close the connection\nconn.close()\n```\n\nIn this example, `'your_database.db'` is the name of your SQLite database file, and `'table_name'` is the name of the table in which you want to find records with age greater than 32. You should replace these placeholders with the actual names for your project.\n\nMake sure you have an SQLite database file, and it has a table named 'table_name' with a column named 'age'. The `fetchall()` function retrieves all rows matching the given query.", "role": "assistant"}}], "created": 1728709859, "model": "dolphin-2.8-mistral-7b-v02", "object": "chat.completion", "system_fingerprint": "dolphin-2.8-mistral-7b-v02", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 301, "prompt_tokens": 47, "total_tokens": 348}, "time": "14.79"}

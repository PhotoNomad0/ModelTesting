We know that Sally has 3 brothers.\n2. Each of these 3 brothers has 2 sisters, so there are a total of (3 x 2) = 6 sisters among Sally's brothers.\n3. Since Sally is not one of her own siblings, the 6 sisters mentioned earlier are only the siblings of her brothers and not including Sally herself.\n4. Therefore, Sally has 4 sisters when considering her own relationship to them.", "role": "assistant"}}], "created": 1728692637, "model": "dolphin-2.8-mistral-7b-v02", "object": "chat.completion", "system_fingerprint": "dolphin-2.8-mistral-7b-v02", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 115, "prompt_tokens": 49, "total_tokens": 164}, "time": "6.10"}

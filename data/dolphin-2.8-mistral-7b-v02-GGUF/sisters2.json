Sally has 3 brothers, and her brothers are mentioned to be plural (more than one) and \"have\" 2 sisters, which means there is at least one sister for each brother.\n2. The number of sisters mentioned is 2, not per brother but in total among all the brothers.\n\nSince we know that Sally has at least one sister, her having 3 brothers does not necessarily mean she has an additional 3 sisters as well (although it's possible). However, given the context and wording, it would make sense to assume that if each brother \"has\" two sisters, then those two sisters would be shared among all the brothers. So Sally could have one of these two sisters.\n\nTherefore, based on the information provided, Sally likely has 1 sister.", "role": "assistant"}}], "created": 1728692657, "model": "dolphin-2.8-mistral-7b-v02", "object": "chat.completion", "system_fingerprint": "dolphin-2.8-mistral-7b-v02", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 177, "prompt_tokens": 52, "total_tokens": 229}, "time": "9.94"}

Since she is not counted in this calculation, we should subtract her from the total count to find out how many siblings she has. Subtracting Sally herself (1 sister) gives us a final answer of: 6 - 1 = 5 sisters.\n\nSally has 5 sisters in total.", "role": "assistant"}}], "created": 1728692667, "model": "dolphin-2.8-mistral-7b-v02", "object": "chat.completion", "system_fingerprint": "dolphin-2.8-mistral-7b-v02", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 136, "prompt_tokens": 56, "total_tokens": 192}, "time": "7.06"}

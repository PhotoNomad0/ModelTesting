When you were 6 years old, your sister was half of that age. So, we can calculate her age at the time as follows:\n   Sister's Age = Half of your age when you were 6\n   Sister's Age = Half of 6 years = 3 years\n\n2. Now, since your sister has aged just like everyone else, we need to figure out how much she has aged from those 6 years till now (when you are 80). Let's call this the \"extra\" age she's gained.\n   Extra Age = Your current age - Your age when you were 6\n   Extra Age = 80 years - 6 years = 74 years\n\n3. Now, we can add her original age (which we calculated earlier) to her extra age:\n   Sister's Current Age = Original Age + Extra Age\n   Sister's Current Age = 3 years + 74 years = 77 years\n\nSo, your sister is currently 77 years old.", "role": "assistant"}}], "created": 1728692391, "model": "dolphin-2.8-mistral-7b-v02", "object": "chat.completion", "system_fingerprint": "dolphin-2.8-mistral-7b-v02", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 238, "prompt_tokens": 62, "total_tokens": 300}, "time": "13.08"}

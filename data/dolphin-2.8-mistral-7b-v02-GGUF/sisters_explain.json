We are given that Sally has 3 brothers.\n2. Each of her brothers is said to have 2 sisters, so we can represent this as a multiplication: 3 brothers * 2 sisters per brother = 6 sisters.\n\nHowever, there's a small inconsistency in the problem statement. It says \"her brothers have 2 sisters,\" which implies that the brothers share these 2 sisters among them. But if they shared the two sisters, Sally couldn't be one of those sisters since she has three brothers already. So, it seems like there may be an error or ambiguity in the question.\n\nAssuming that each brother indeed has two sisters, but not all of them are siblings to Sally (which would mean that her parents have more children than just her and her brothers), we cannot determine how many sisters Sally has based on this information alone. There could potentially be additional sisters or even half-sisters from another family.\n\nSo, the answer depends on clarifying the relationship between Sally's brothers and their shared sisters. Until that information is provided, it is impossible to accurately determine how many sisters Sally has.", "role": "assistant"}}], "created": 1728692643, "model": "dolphin-2.8-mistral-7b-v02", "object": "chat.completion", "system_fingerprint": "dolphin-2.8-mistral-7b-v02", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 253, "prompt_tokens": 53, "total_tokens": 306}, "time": "14.02"}

Each row in the CSV will represent a state with its name, year it joined the United States, and its capital city. The \"state\" fieldnames are used to specify the headers for the CSV file. The states are stored as dictionaries in the `states` list where each dictionary represents one state.\n\nPlease note that this script is just an example and you would need to add all 50 states with their respective information.", "role": "assistant"}}], "created": 1728696034, "model": "dolphin-2.8-mistral-7b-v02", "object": "chat.completion", "system_fingerprint": "dolphin-2.8-mistral-7b-v02", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 392, "prompt_tokens": 52, "total_tokens": 444}, "time": "939.51"}

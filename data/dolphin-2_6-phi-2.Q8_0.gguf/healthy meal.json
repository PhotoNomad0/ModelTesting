Here's a sample healthy meal plan for today:\n\nBreakfast: \n- Overnight oats topped with fresh berries and a sprinkle of chia seeds. You can also add some Greek yogurt or almond milk if desired.\n\nSnack: \n- A handful of mixed nuts, such as almonds, walnuts, and cashews. If you prefer something sweet, try dried fruit like apricots or cranberries.\n\nLunch: \n- Grilled chicken salad with plenty of colorful vegetables (like spinach, bell peppers, tomatoes, cucumbers), a light vinaigrette dressing, and some whole grain croutons for crunch.\n\nSnack: \n- A small portion of hummus or guacamole paired with carrot sticks or cherry tomatoes.\n\nDinner: \n- Baked salmon seasoned with lemon, dill, and garlic, served alongside steamed broccoli and quinoa. For dessert, try a fruit salad made from seasonal fruits like berries, melon, and pineapple.\n\nRemember to drink plenty of water throughout the day and enjoy your meals in moderation!

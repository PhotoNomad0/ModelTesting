Metaphor: A figure of speech that makes a comparison between two unlike things by stating one thing is another. For example, \"Her eyes were stars.\"\n2. Simile: Similar to metaphor but uses the words 'like' or 'as' for making comparisons. Example: \"He was as brave as a lion.\"\n3. Personification: When human qualities are attributed to non-human entities like animals, objects, or abstract ideas. For example, \"The wind whispered through the trees.\"\n4. Hyperbole: Exaggeration used for emphasis or effect. For instance, \"I've told you a million times!\"\n5. Idiom: A phrase whose meaning is different from the literal interpretation of its words. Examples include 'kick the bucket' (to die) and 'break a leg' (good luck).\n6. Alliteration: The repetition of initial consonant sounds in close proximity, often for emphasis or poetic effect. Example: \"Peter Piper picked a peck of pickled peppers.\"\n7. Onomatopoeia: Words that imitate the sound they represent. Examples include 'buzz', 'hiss', and 'clang'.\n8. Irony: A contrast between what is expected to happen and what actually happens, often used for humor or emphasis on a point.

It helps us understand if something happened in the past, is happening right now (present), will happen in the future, or has already been completed. The main types of verb tenses are:\n\n1. Simple Present Tense: This tense is used for actions that occur regularly and can be done by anyone at any time. It's formed with the base form of the verb (e.g., \"I walk,\" \"You read\").\n2. Simple Past Tense: This tense is used to describe completed actions in the past, such as events or states that have already happened. It's formed with the simple past form of the verb (e.g., \"I walked,\" \"You read\").\n3. Present Continuous Tense: This tense is used for ongoing actions happening right now or actions being done at this very moment. It's formed by using the present continuous form of the verb, which often includes the auxiliary verb 'to be' and the base form of the main verb (e.g., \"I am walking,\" \"You are reading\").\n4. Simple Past Continuous Tense: This tense is used to describe ongoing actions in the past that were still happening at a specific time or for an extended period. It's formed with the simple past continuous form of the verb, which often includes 'to be' and the base form of the main verb (e.g., \"I was walking,\" \"You were reading\").\n5. Present Perfect Tense: This tense is used to describe actions that began in the past but have a connection to the present moment or are still ongoing. It's formed with the auxiliary verb 'have' and the base form of the main verb (e.g., \"I have walked,\" \"You have read\").\n6. Simple Past Perfect Tense: This tense is used to describe completed actions that happened before another past action in time.

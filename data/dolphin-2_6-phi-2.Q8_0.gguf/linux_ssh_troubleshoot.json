In this case, it could be due to the following reasons:\n\n1. Incorrect username/password combination: Make sure you are using the correct username and password for your AWS account. If they're incorrect, you won't be able to connect to the server.\n2. Permissions issue on the remote system: The user running the command might not have permission to access the specified port (5900) or resource (ec2-34-221-131-108.us-west-2.compute.amazonaws.com). Check your permissions and make sure you're allowed to connect to this server.\n3. Incorrect SSH key file: The user might not have the correct SSH public key file (~/UserKey.pem) or it could be expired, in which case they won't be able to authenticate with AWS. Make sure the key is valid and up-to-date.\n4. Network connectivity issue: Ensure that you're connected to the internet and that your network connection is stable. If not, try reconnecting and see if the problem persists.\n5. Incorrect SSH version or configuration: The user might be using an outdated SSH client or have incorrect configurations in their system. Make sure you are using the latest version of SSH and check for any conflicting settings on your system.\n\nTo resolve this issue, double-check all these factors and make necessary adjustments to ensure that you're able to connect to the remote server with the correct permissions and credentials."}, "finish_reason": "stop"}], "usage": {"prompt_tokens": 137, "completion_tokens": 331, "total_tokens": 468}, "time": "8.67"}

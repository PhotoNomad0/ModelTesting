(a^m)^x = a^(mx), which is equivalent to a^(mx + n*m) = a^n * a^(mx).\n2. (a^n)^y = a^ny, which is equivalent to a^(ny + m*n) = a^m * a^(ny).\n\nUsing these properties, we can rewrite the equation as:\n5^X * 2^X = 130\n\nNow, let's find the common base for both terms. The least common multiple of 5 and 2 is 10. So, we can write the equation as:\n10^X * (2^(X/2))^2 = 130\n\nSince X is a positive integer, X must be divisible by 2. Let's divide X by 2 to get an expression for Y:\nY = X / 2\n\nNow, substitute this value of Y back into the equation:\n10^(X/2) * (2^((X/2)/2))^2 = 130\n\nSimplify the exponent:\n10^(X/4) * 4^X = 130\n\nSince 10 and 4 are relatively prime, we can use the property of exponents that states: a^m * b^n = (a*b)^(mn). So, let's rewrite the equation as:\n((10*2)^X)^4 = 130\n\nSimplify the exponent:\n(20^X)^4 = 130\n\nNow, apply the property of exponents that states: a^m * b^n = (a^m)(b^n):\n(20^X)*(5^X)^2 = 130\n\nSince 20 and 5 are relatively prime, we can use the property of exponents that states: a^m * b^n = (a*b)^(mn). So, let's rewrite the equation as:\n((10*2)^X)*(5^X)^2 = 130\n\nSimplify the exponent:\n(20^X)*25^X = 130\n\nNow, apply the property of exponents that states: a^m * b^n = (a*b)^(mn):\n(500^X) = 130\n\nTo solve for X, we can take the logarithm base 500 on both sides of the equation. Since 500 is greater than 2 and 5, we will use the natural logarithm:\nln(500^X) = ln(130)\n\nUsing the power rule of logarithms (log_a(b^c) = c*log_a(b)), we get:\nX * ln(500) = ln(130)\n\nNow, divide both sides by ln(500):\nX = ln(130)/ln(500)\n\nUsing a calculator to find the values of ln(130) and ln(500), we get:\nX \u2248 0.3594 / 1.6093\nX \u2248 0.2295\n\nSince X must be an integer, there is no solution for this equation with positive integers as exponents."}, "finish_reason": "stop"}], "usage": {"prompt_tokens": 91, "completion_tokens": 725, "total_tokens": 816}, "time": "20.60"}

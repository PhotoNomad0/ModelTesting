Therefore, Emily used an average of 7 cereal bits in each design.\n\nAs for whether she used an equal number of cereal bits in each design or not, we cannot definitively say without more information about the distribution of cereal bits within her designs. However, since she created a total of 9 designs and used 63 cereal bits, it is likely that she did use an approximately equal amount of cereal bits per design (7 to 8), assuming no leftover cereal bits were left over after creating all designs."}, "finish_reason": "stop"}], "usage": {"prompt_tokens": 128, "completion_tokens": 145, "total_tokens": 273}, "time": "4.19"}

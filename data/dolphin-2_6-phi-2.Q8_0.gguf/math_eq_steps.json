So, 4*2 equals 8.\n\nNow our equation looks like this: 25 - 8 + 3\n\nNext, we do subtraction and addition from left to right. So, subtracting 8 from 25 gives us 17. Then adding 3 to 17 results in 20. \n\nSo the final answer is 20."}, "finish_reason": "stop"}], "usage": {"prompt_tokens": 88, "completion_tokens": 107, "total_tokens": 195}, "time": "2.95"}

In your case, a=1, b=0, c=1 and d=-130. So, the given equation is:\n\nx^3 - 130 = 0\n\nNow, we can apply Cardano's Formula to find the value of x:\n\nCardano's formula for cubic equations in the form ax^3 + bx^2 + cx + d = 0 has the following general solution:\n\nx = (r \u00b1 \u221a(s^2 - 4t)) / 2a, where r and s are given by the following formulas:\n\nr = [b \u00b1 \u221a((4ac) - (3b^2)(d))] / (6a),\ns = [(2c^2 - b^2 + d^2) \u00b1 \u221a(s^2 - 4t)] / 2,\nt = (2c^2 - 3b^2 + 4ad) / (9a^2).\n\nIn your case, a=1, b=0, c=1 and d=-130. Plugging these values into the formulas for r and s:\n\nr = [0 \u00b1 \u221a((4(1)(-130)) - (3(0)(-130)))] / (6(1))\ns = [(2(1)^2 - 0^2 + (-130)^2) \u00b1 \u221a((s)^2 - 4t)] / 2,\nt = (2(1)^2 - 3(0)^2 + 4(-130)(-130)) / (9(1)^4).\n\nNow, we need to find the value of t. Plugging in the values for a and b:\n\nt = (2(1)^2 - 3(0)^2 + 4(-130)(-130)) / (9(1)^4)\nt = (2 - 0 + 54400) / 9\nt \u2248 58.897\n\nNow, we can find the values of r and s:\n\nr = [0 \u00b1 \u221a((4(1)(-130)) - (3(0)(-130)))] / (6(1))\nr = [0 \u00b1 \u221a(-520 + 0)] / 6\nSince the discriminant is negative, there are no real solutions for r. Therefore, we only need to find the value of s:\ns = [(2(1)^2 - 0^2 + (-130)^2) \u00b1 \u221a((s)^2 - 4t)] / 2\ns = [2 + 130 \u00b1 \u221a((s)^2 - 4*58.897)] / 2\nSince the discriminant is negative, there are no real solutions for s either. Therefore, this cubic equation has only one complex solution:\n\nx \u2248 (r + i\u221a(s))/2a = [0 \u00b1 \u221a(-520)i]/(6*1)\nx \u2248 0 \u00b1 10.944i\n\nSo, the value of x where a=1, b=0, c=1 and d=-130 is approximately:\nx \u2248 -10.944 + i * 10.944 or x \u2248 10.944 - i * 10.944"}, "finish_reason": "stop"}], "usage": {"prompt_tokens": 121, "completion_tokens": 679, "total_tokens": 800}, "time": "19.97"}

If someone wrote ten notes per day, they would use up one full notepad in 10 days (5 sheets/note * 1 notepad). \n\nHowever, if the person only used four sheets of paper per note or reused parts of the sheets, then the notepad could last longer than 10 days depending on how many notes are written each day. Without more information about the usage pattern, we can't determine an exact duration for one notepad to last with ten notes per day."}, "finish_reason": "stop"}], "usage": {"prompt_tokens": 135, "completion_tokens": 173, "total_tokens": 308}, "time": "5.15"}

So, the second and third experiments together required 6 test tubes (8 - 2 = 6).\nSince both these two experiments require the same number of test tubes, each requires x/2 test tubes. \nSo we can write this as an equation: \nx + x/2 = 6.\nTo solve for x, first multiply through by 2 to get rid of the fraction:\n2*(x+x/2) = 12.\nThis simplifies to:\n2*x + x = 12.\nCombining like terms gives us 3*x = 12. \nDividing both sides by 3 gives us x = 4. \nSo, each of the other two experiments required 4 test tubes."}, "finish_reason": "stop"}], "usage": {"prompt_tokens": 123, "completion_tokens": 194, "total_tokens": 317}, "time": "5.25"}

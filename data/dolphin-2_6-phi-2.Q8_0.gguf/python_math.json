For example, to find the roots of `ax^3 + bx^2 + cx + d = 0`, you would call the function like so:\n\n```python\na = 1# coefficient of x^3\nb = -6# coefficient of x^2\nc = 11# coefficient of x\nd = -6# constant term\n\nprint(newton_raphson(a, b, c, d))\n```"}, "finish_reason": "stop"}], "usage": {"prompt_tokens": 105, "completion_tokens": 273, "total_tokens": 378}, "time": "8.10"}

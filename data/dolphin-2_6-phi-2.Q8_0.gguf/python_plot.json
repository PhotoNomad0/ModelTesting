However, to provide an accurate solution, I would need more information about the DataFrame and what specific columns you want to compare. Could you please specify? \n\nHere's a general example of how you might create such a plot using matplotlib:\n```python\nimport pandas as pd\nimport matplotlib.pyplot as plt\n\n# Assuming df is your DataFrame and 'column1' & 'column2' are the columns to compare\ndf = pd.read_csv('yourfile.csv')# replace with your file path if necessary\nplt.figure(figsize=(10, 6))\n\nplt.subplot(211)\ndf['column1'].hist()\nplt.title(\"Distribution of 'column1'\")\n\nplt.subplot(212)\ndf['column2'].hist()\nplt.title(\"Distribution of 'column2'\")\n\nplt.tight_layout()\nplt.show()\n```\nThis code will create a histogram for each column in your DataFrame, with the titles indicating what is being compared. Adjust the `figsize` parameter to change the size of the plot and adjust the subplot layout as needed. \n\nPlease provide more details about your dataframe and columns so I can give you a specific solution tailored to your needs."}, "finish_reason": "stop"}], "usage": {"prompt_tokens": 88, "completion_tokens": 277, "total_tokens": 365}, "time": "7.27"}

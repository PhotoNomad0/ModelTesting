If you don't have it installed already, you can install it using pip:\n```bash\npip install openpyxl\n```\nHere is a simple function that reads from an Excel spreadsheet named \"example.xlsx\":\n\n```python\nimport openpyxl\nfrom openpyxl import load_workbook\n\ndef read_excel(file):\n# Load the workbook\nwb = load_workbook(filename=file)\n\n# Select a worksheet by name or index\nws = wb.active\n\n# Get column and row names from the first cell in the sheet\ncols, rows = zip(*[cell for cell in ws.iter_rows()])\ncolumn_names = [cell.value for cell in cols]\nrow_names = [cell.value for cell in rows]\n\n# Return column and row names as lists\nreturn list(zip(column_names, row_names))\n```\nYou can use this function like so:\n\n```python\nresult = read_excel(\"example.xlsx\")\nprint(result)\n```\nThis will print out the column and row names from your Excel spreadsheet. Note that you should replace \"example.xlsx\" with the name of your actual file if it's different."}, "finish_reason": "stop"}], "usage": {"prompt_tokens": 85, "completion_tokens": 275, "total_tokens": 360}, "time": "8.13"}

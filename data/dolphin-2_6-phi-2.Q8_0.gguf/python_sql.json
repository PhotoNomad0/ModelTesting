Here's a sample code snippet that will do what you're asking for:\n\n```python\nimport sqlite3\n\n# Connect to your database file (or create it if it doesn't exist)\nconn = sqlite3.connect('your_database.db')\ncursor = conn.cursor()\n\n# Execute the SQL query and fetch all records where age is greater than 32\nquery = \"SELECT * FROM table_name WHERE age > 32\"\ncursor.execute(query)\nresults = cursor.fetchall()\n\n# Print or use the results as needed\nfor row in results:\nprint(row)\n\n# Close the connection to your database file\nconn.close()\n```\nReplace `'your_database.db'`, `table_name`, and any other necessary values with your actual database name, table name, and field names (in this case, 'age'). This code will connect to a SQLite database, execute the query to get all records where the age is greater than 32, fetch those results, print them out, and then close the connection."}, "finish_reason": "stop"}], "usage": {"prompt_tokens": 92, "completion_tokens": 237, "total_tokens": 329}, "time": "6.18"}

He proposed a new design that would allow larger locomotives to be used on the rail network, as well as increase efficiency and reduce costs associated with track maintenance. The idea behind this new gauge was based on the concept of \"measurement\" - each pair of rails should have the same distance between them, allowing for smooth movement of trains without any interference or obstruction from other tracks.\n\nThe standard gauge is defined as a track spacing of 4 feet 8 and 1/2 inches (1,435 millimeters) between the inner edges of the rail plates. This measurement was chosen because it allowed for larger locomotives to be used on the network, while still providing enough space for smaller trains to pass each other safely. The standard gauge also made it easier to build bridges and tunnels that could accommodate both narrow-gauge and broad-gauge tracks, further increasing efficiency and reducing costs associated with track maintenance.\n\nThe adoption of the standard gauge was a major turning point in the history of railways, as it allowed for the rapid expansion of rail networks across Europe and North America. Today, the majority of railway systems around the world use this standardized gauge, making it easier to transport goods and people over long distances quickly and efficiently."}, "finish_reason": "stop"}], "usage": {"prompt_tokens": 83, "completion_tokens": 272, "total_tokens": 355}, "time": "6.88"}

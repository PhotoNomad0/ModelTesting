Since there are 3 brothers in total, this means they share a total of 3 x 2 = 6 sisters among themselves.\n\nNow, Sally also has these same 6 sisters as part of her family. Therefore, the total number of sisters Sally shares with her brothers is 6 + 1 (Sally herself) = 7 sisters. \n\nSo, Sally has 7 sisters in total."}, "finish_reason": "stop"}], "usage": {"prompt_tokens": 94, "completion_tokens": 115, "total_tokens": 209}, "time": "3.06"}

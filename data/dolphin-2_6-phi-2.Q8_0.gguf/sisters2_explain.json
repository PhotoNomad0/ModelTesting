Sally has 3 brothers, which means she has 3 siblings in total (including herself).\n2. Each of her 3 brothers also has 2 sisters. This means that each brother contributes 2 more people to their family. Since there are 3 brothers, this adds up to a total of 6 additional people (3 x 2 = 6) from the brothers' families.\n3. To find out how many siblings Sally has in total, we add her own number of siblings and the extra people from her brothers' families: 3 + 6 = 9.\n4. Since each brother contributes 2 sisters to their family, there are a total of 6 x 2 = 12 sisters added by Sally's brothers.\n5. To find out how many sisters Sally has in total, we add the number of additional sisters contributed by her brothers and the original number of siblings she had: 9 + 12 = 21.\n6. However, since each brother also contributes their own sister to their family (not just Sally), there are actually 6 x 3 = 18 extra sisters added by all three brothers' families in total.\n7. To find out how many sisters Sally has in total, we subtract the extra sisters contributed by her brothers from the original number of siblings she had: 21 - 18 = 3.\nSo, Sally has 3 sisters in total."}, "finish_reason": "stop"}], "usage": {"prompt_tokens": 100, "completion_tokens": 271, "total_tokens": 371}, "time": "7.34"}

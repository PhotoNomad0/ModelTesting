When you were 6 years old, your sister was half of your age. So, if we denote your current age as 'x', then her age at that time would be x/2. \n2. Now, it is mentioned that you are 80 years old now. This means that the difference in ages between when you both were 6 and now is (80 - 6) = 74 years.\n3. Since your sister was half of your age when you were 6, we can set up an equation: x/2 + 74 = 80. \n4. Solving this equation for 'x', we get x = 80 - 2*74 = 8.\n5. Therefore, at the time when you both were 6 years old, your sister was half of your age which is 4 years old (8 / 2).\n6. Now, to find out how old she is now, add her current age from step 5 plus the difference in ages between then and now: 4 + 74 = 78. \nSo, your sister is currently 78 years old."}, "finish_reason": "stop"}], "usage": {"prompt_tokens": 105, "completion_tokens": 221, "total_tokens": 326}, "time": "5.74"}

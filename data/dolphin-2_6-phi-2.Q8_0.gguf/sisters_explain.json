We know that Sally has 3 brothers, and each brother has 2 sisters. So we multiply the number of brothers (3) by the number of sisters per brother (2): 3 * 2 = 6 sisters for her brothers in total.\n2. Now let's add these 6 sisters to the original question: Sally already had 1 sister before her brothers came along, so if she has 6 more from her brothers and we don't want to count them twice, then Sally now has 7 sisters (1 + 6). \n3. Therefore, Sally has a total of 7 sisters including herself."}, "finish_reason": "stop"}], "usage": {"prompt_tokens": 97, "completion_tokens": 128, "total_tokens": 225}, "time": "3.33"}

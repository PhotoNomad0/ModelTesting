Typos or incorrect permissions can lead to this error.\n* **SSH Server Configuration Issues:** There might be a problem with how SSH is configured on the remote server, preventing it from properly reading or using public keys.\n* **Permissions Issues:**  You may not have the necessary permissions to access or use the private key file (`~/UserKey.pem`).\n\n**Troubleshooting Steps:**\n\n1. **Verify Key Existence:** Double-check that `~/UserKey.pem` exists and that it's a valid PEM file containing your public key.\n2. **Check Server's Authorized Keys:** Connect to the server using another method (e.g., with a password if you have one) and check the `/home/your_username/.ssh/authorized_keys` file for your public key. \n3. **Add Public Key to Server:** If your public key isn't in the authorized_keys file, follow these steps:\n\n   - On your local machine, extract your public key from the private key file:\n     ```bash\n     cat ~/UserKey.pem.pub\n     ```\n   - Copy the extracted public key.\n   - Connect to the server using another method and add the copied key to the `authorized_keys` file using a text editor (e.g., `nano`).\n\n4. **Review SSH Server Configuration:** If you suspect a configuration issue, examine the SSH server's configuration files (`/etc/ssh/sshd_config`) on the remote machine. Make sure that public key authentication is enabled and properly configured.\n5. **Permissions Check:** Ensure that your private key file has appropriate permissions (e.g., `chmod 600 ~/UserKey.pem`).\n\n\n\nLet me know if you have any more questions or need further assistance!", "role": "assistant"}}], "created": 1727042702, "model": "lmstudio-community/gemma-2-9b-it-GGUF/gemma-2-9b-it-Q4_K_M.gguf", "object": "chat.completion", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 533, "prompt_tokens": 99, "total_tokens": 632}, "time": "31.64"}

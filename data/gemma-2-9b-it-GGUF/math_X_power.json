Recognize the Relationship:**\n\n* Notice that 8 can be expressed as 2<sup>3</sup>.  Substitute this into the equation: (2<sup>3</sup>)<sup>X</sup> + 2<sup>X</sup> = 130\n\n* Simplify using exponent rules: 2<sup>3X</sup> + 2<sup>X</sup> = 130\n\n**2. Substitution:**\n\n* Let y = 2<sup>X</sup>. This substitution will make the equation easier to work with.\n*  Our equation now becomes: y<sup>3</sup> + y = 130\n\n**3. Rearrange and Solve:**\n\n* Subtract 130 from both sides: y<sup>3</sup> + y - 130 = 0\n* This is a cubic equation, and solving it directly can be tricky. You might need to use numerical methods (like a graphing calculator or software) to find the approximate solution for y.\n\n**4. Substitute Back:**\n\n* Once you have an approximate value for y, substitute back 2<sup>X</sup> = y to solve for X.  \n    * For example, if you find y \u2248 5, then: 2<sup>X</sup> \u2248 5\n    * Solve for X using logarithms: X \u2248 log<sub>2</sub>(5)\n\n\nLet me know if you'd like me to elaborate on any specific step or try to find an approximate solution for y.  \n", "role": "assistant"}}], "created": 1727042231, "model": "lmstudio-community/gemma-2-9b-it-GGUF/gemma-2-9b-it-Q4_K_M.gguf", "object": "chat.completion", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 326, "prompt_tokens": 48, "total_tokens": 374}, "time": "17.50"}

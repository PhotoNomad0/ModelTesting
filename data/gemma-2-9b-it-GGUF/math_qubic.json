Here's the general form:\n\n*  x = u + v\n\nWhere:\n\n*  u and v are the roots of two quadratic equations derived from the original cubic equation. \n\nThe derivation of these quadratic equations involves several steps and substitutions, including:\n\n1. **Transforming the cubic:**  We manipulate the equation to a standard form. In your case, it's already in standard form: x\u00b3 + x + (-130) = 0\n2. **Introducing new variables:** We introduce variables like p and q based on the coefficients of the original cubic.\n3. **Solving quadratic equations:** We derive two quadratic equations that we solve for u and v.\n\n**Applying to Your Equation (x\u00b3 + x - 130 = 0):**\n\n1.  **Identify p and q:**\n    *   p = 0 (coefficient of x\u00b2)\n    *   q = -130 (constant term)\n\n2. **Calculate the discriminant:** \u0394 = 18pq - 4p\u00b3\n    *  \u0394 = 18(0)(-130) - 4(0)\u00b3 = 0\n\n3. **The complex part:** Since the discriminant is zero, Cardano's formula involves complex numbers. The derivation gets more involved here.\n\n\n**Important Note:** Due to the complexity of Cardano's formula, it's often more practical to use numerical methods (like Newton-Raphson) or graphing calculators to find approximate solutions for cubic equations.\n\n\n\nLet me know if you want to explore any specific part of the process in more detail!", "role": "assistant"}}], "created": 1727042280, "model": "lmstudio-community/gemma-2-9b-it-GGUF/gemma-2-9b-it-Q4_K_M.gguf", "object": "chat.completion", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 384, "prompt_tokens": 77, "total_tokens": 461}, "time": "20.77"}

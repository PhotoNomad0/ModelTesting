Here's the formula:\n\n*x* = ( -b/3a + \u221a( (b/3a)\u00b2 - c/(3a) )^(1/3)) + (-b/3a - \u221a( (b/3a)\u00b2 - c/(3a) )^(1/3))\n\n**Applying the Formula to Our Equation**\n\n1. **Identify coefficients:**\n   * a = 1\n   * b = 0\n   * c = 1\n   * d = -130\n\n2. **Simplify Cardano's Formula:**  Since *b* = 0, our formula simplifies:\n\n   *x* = ( \u221a( -(c/(3a)) )^(1/3)) + (- \u221a( -(c/(3a)) )^(1/3))\n\n   *x* = ( \u221a( -1/(3) )^(1/3)) + (- \u221a( -1/(3) )^(1/3))\n\n3. **Calculate:**  \n    * \u221a(-1/3) is a complex number. Let's represent it as *k*. So, we have:\n      *x* = ( *k* )^(1/3) + (- *k* )^(1/3)\n\n**Finding the Solution**\n\nThe exact solution involves complex numbers and cube roots.  You can use a calculator with complex number capabilities or numerical methods to approximate the real and imaginary parts of the solutions.\n\n\n\nLet me know if you'd like me to elaborate on any specific step or explore the complex number aspects further!", "role": "assistant"}}], "created": 1727042300, "model": "lmstudio-community/gemma-2-9b-it-GGUF/gemma-2-9b-it-Q4_K_M.gguf", "object": "chat.completion", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 406, "prompt_tokens": 55, "total_tokens": 461}, "time": "21.68"}

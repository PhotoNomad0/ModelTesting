This dimension was likely chosen based on the average size of a chariot wheel and axle at the time. Centuries later, when railways were developed, British engineers adopted this gauge, possibly due to its familiarity and pre-existing infrastructure.\n\nThe widespread use of this gauge in Britain, coupled with its adoption by other countries, led to its standardization as the most common railway gauge globally.\n", "role": "assistant"}}], "created": 1727042224, "model": "lmstudio-community/gemma-2-9b-it-GGUF/gemma-2-9b-it-Q4_K_M.gguf", "object": "chat.completion", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 130, "prompt_tokens": 36, "total_tokens": 166}, "time": "7.08"}

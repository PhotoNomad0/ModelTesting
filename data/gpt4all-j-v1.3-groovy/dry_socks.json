Write a response that appropriately completes the request.\n\n### Instruction:\nTom washed 10 pairs of socks. The socks are now wet from the wash, so Tom hangs the 10 pairs of socks outside to dry. 10 hours later, he comes back outside to check on the socks. He feels each sock and notices they are all dry. He takes them back inside because they are all dry. How long will it take Tom to dry seven pairs of socks presuming the same weather conditions?\n\n### Response:\n\nTom hung 10 wet socks outside for a total of 20 hours (10 x 2). After hanging, he checked on each pair and found that they were all dry after 10 hours. Therefore, it would take Tom approximately 7 hours to dry seven pairs of socks assuming the same weather conditions as before."}], "created": 1692755517, "id": "foobarbaz", "model": "ggml-gpt4all-j-v1.3-groovy.bin", "object": "text_completion", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 59, "prompt_tokens": 123, "total_tokens": 182}, "time": "5.69"}

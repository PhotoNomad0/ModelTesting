write a JavaScript program to generate and print out the ascii character and hexadecimal codes for 0 to 7f
Sure, here's an example of how you can write a JavaScript program that generates ASCII characters from 0 to 7F and prints them in hexadecimal format using the `console.log()` method:
```javascript
for (let i = 0; i < 8; i++) {
  console.log(String.fromCharCode(i)); // Prints each character as a string
}
```
This program uses a for loop to iterate through the range of characters from 0 to 7F, and within that loop it calls `console.log()` method which prints the ASCII value of each character in hexadecimal format using the `String.fromCharCode()` method.

Write a response that appropriately completes the request.\n\n### Instruction:\ncreate a javascript function that uses regex to extract a three character code like \"1Jn\" from a filename in format \"57-1Jn.usfm\".  The characters can be upper or lower case letters or digits. And the filename extension must be \".usfm\".\n\n### Response:\n\nSure, here's an example of how you could create such a function using JavaScript and regular expressions:\n```javascript\nfunction extractCode(filename) {\n  const pattern = /^(\\d|[a-zA-Z]){3}-[\\w]*\\.usfm$/; // matches filenames that start with three digits or letters, followed by a hyphen and then the extension \".usfm\"\n\n  if (pattern.test(filename)) {\n    return filename.substring(0, 4) + \"-\" + filename.substring(4); // extracts first four characters as code and last two characters as extension\n  } else {\n    console.log(\"Invalid file format.\");\n  }\n}\n```"}], "created": 1693310863, "id": "foobarbaz", "model": "ggml-gpt4all-j-v1.3-groovy.bin", "object": "text_completion", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 167, "prompt_tokens": 98, "total_tokens": 265}, "time": "10.42"}

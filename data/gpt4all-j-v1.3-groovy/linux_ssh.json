The \"-i\" option specifies the path of your private key file, \"~/UserKey.pem\", which contains information about your account and allows you to authenticate with the remote server. \nThe \"-C\" flag enables compression for faster transfer speeds between the two machines. Finally, \"-L 259:0:localhost:590:0\" specifies that traffic from localhost (your machine) should be forwarded through port 590 on the EC2 instance and then back to your computer via SSH tunneling. \nThis command allows you to access an Amazon EC2 instance remotely using a private key file, without having to manually enter any login credentials or navigate complex network configurations."}], "created": 1692755680, "id": "foobarbaz", "model": "ggml-gpt4all-j-v1.3-groovy.bin", "object": "text_completion", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 162, "prompt_tokens": 98, "total_tokens": 260}, "time": "10.56"}

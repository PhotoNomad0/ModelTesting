To resolve this issue, you can try one of these solutions: \n1. Grant permissions for the user by running `sudo chmod -R 755 /home/ec2-34/.ssh` and then run the command again with sudo privileges using `sudo ssh ec2-34-221-131-108.us-west-2.compute.amazonaws.com`.\n2. Change the port number in your SSH configuration file (usually located at ~/.ssh/config) to a different value, such as 59020 or 59000. Then run `sudo service ssh restart` and try again with the new port number using `ssh -i \"~/UserKey.pem\" -C -L 25910:localhost:59020 ec2-34-221-131-108.us-west-2.compute.amazonaws.com`.\n3. If you are connecting to a different instance, make sure that the correct IP address and port number is specified in your SSH configuration file (usually located at ~/.ssh/config)."}], "created": 1692755698, "id": "foobarbaz", "model": "ggml-gpt4all-j-v1.3-groovy.bin", "object": "text_completion", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 246, "prompt_tokens": 107, "total_tokens": 353}, "time": "17.58"}

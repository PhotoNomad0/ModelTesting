This could be due to several reasons such as incorrect file permissions or an outdated version of OpenSSL.\n```bash\nTo troubleshoot this issue: \n1. Check the SSH configuration on both your server and client machines for any differences that may affect key authentication. You can use `ssh -T <server_ip>` to test if you are able to connect using a public key from another machine, or check the logs of the ssh service running on your server (e.g., /var/log/auth.log).\n2. Verify that both machines have OpenSSL installed and configured correctly with RSA keys enabled for authentication. You can use `openssl version` to verify this information. \n3. Check if you are using a different SSH client or terminal emulator on your local machine, as some clients may not support certain key types (e.g., DSA vs RSA). If so, try updating the software and/or configuring it with an appropriate public key type for authentication."}], "created": 1690374699, "id": "foobarbaz", "model": "Groovy", "object": "text_completion", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 253, "prompt_tokens": 80, "total_tokens": 333}, "time": "187.98"}

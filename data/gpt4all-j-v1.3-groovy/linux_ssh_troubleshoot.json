To resolve this issue, you can try one of these solutions:\n1. Open up ports in your AWS account's VPC settings for traffic between the local machine and the remote server. You may need permission or a support contract with an Internet Service Provider to do so. Once open, make sure that there are no rules blocking access from outside of Amazon Web Services (AWS).\n2. Use SSH tunneling instead of port forwarding when connecting via Telnet. This will allow you to use the same IP address and port as your local machine for both connections without any additional configuration on either end."}], "created": 1692407562, "id": "foobarbaz", "model": "ggml-gpt4all-j-v1.3-groovy.bin", "object": "text_completion", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 161, "prompt_tokens": 77, "total_tokens": 238}, "time": "478.50"}

In the morning, Emily decided to create some designs with her cereal bits. In total, she created 9 designs and used 63 cereal bits. About how many cereal bits were in each design? Do you think she used an equal number of cereal bits in each design?
I am sorry, I do not have enough information to answer that question. Can you please provide me with more context or details about the situation?

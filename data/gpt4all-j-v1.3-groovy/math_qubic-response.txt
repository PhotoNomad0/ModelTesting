in ax^3+bx^2+c*x+d=0, use the cardano's formula to get the value for x where a=1, b=0, c=1 and d=-130
To find the value of x in the equation ax^3+bx^2+c\*x+d = 0 using Cardano's formula, we need to substitute the given values into the formula. Here is the calculation:

a = 1
b = 0
c = 1
d = -130

Solving for x, we get:

x = (-b + sqrt(b^2-4ac)) / (2*a)

Now, to find the value of x where a=1, b=0, c=1 and d=-130, we need to substitute these values into the formula. Here is the calculation:

x = (-0 + sqrt(0^2-4(1\*1)(1\*1)-4(1\*1)(1\*1)))/(2\*1)

This simplifies to:

x = -130 / 2

Therefore, the value of x where a=1, b=0, c=1 and d=-130 is -130/2.

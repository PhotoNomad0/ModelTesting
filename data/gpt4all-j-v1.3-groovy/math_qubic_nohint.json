Write a response that appropriately completes the request.\n\n### Instruction:\nin x^3+x-130=0, solve for the value for x\n\n### Response:\n\nTo find the solution to this equation in terms of x, we need to isolate it on one side and simplify its expression using algebraic operations such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, etc. Here's a step-by-step guide that can help you solve for the value of x:\n1. Start by simplifying both sides of the equation: \nx^3+x - 130 = 0\n2. Add and subtract 1 from each side to isolate it on one side: \n(x + 1) (x^2-130) = 0\n3. Multiply both sides with x, then divide by x: \n1/x * (x + 1)(x^2 - 130) = 0\n4. Simplify the expression using algebraic operations to isolate it on one side and simplify its expression further: \n(x+1)/x*((x-130)*x+(130))=0\n5. Factorize both sides of this equation by grouping terms with a common factor (in this case, x): \n(x + 1)(x - 130) = 0\n6. Divide the first term on one side and simplify: \n1/2 * (x^3+130-x*130)=0\n7. Simplify further using algebraic operations to isolate it on one side: \n((x^3+130)/(2\\*x)) - 130 = 0\n8. Solve for x by multiplying both sides with 2 and dividing the result by (x^3 + 130): \n1/4 * ((x^3+130) / (x^3 + 130)) \\* (x^3 + 130) = 1\n9. Simplify further using algebraic operations to isolate it on one side: \n(2\\*x)/((x^3+130)\\*(x^3+130)))=1/4"}], "created": 1692755159, "id": "foobarbaz", "model": "ggml-gpt4all-j-v1.3-groovy.bin", "object": "text_completion", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 401, "prompt_tokens": 56, "total_tokens": 457}, "time": "23.12"}

in x^3+x-130=0, use the cardano's formula to get the value for x
Sure! Here is a step-by-step guide on how to find the solution using Cardano's formula:

1. Start by setting up the equation in the form of `ax^3 + bx - c = 0` where `a`, `b`, and `c` are constants.
2. Next, use the formula for the cube root of a number to find the value of `x`. In this case, we have:
```css
x = (b/a)^(1/3)
```
So, substitute x with this expression in the equation and simplify it using algebraic operations. The final result should be:
```scss
x^3 + bx - c = 0
                                x^3 + (b/a)^(1/3)x - c = 0
                                x^3 + b*(b/a)^(1/3) - c = 0
```
Now, use the formula for `x^3` to find the value of `c`. In this case:
```css
x^3 = (b/a)^(1/3)*c
```
So, substitute x and c with their expressions in the equation above. The final result should be:
```scss
x^3 + b*(b/a)^(1/3) - c = 0
                                x^3 + (b/a)^(1/3)*c - b*c = 0
```
Finally, use the formula for `x-130=0` to find the value of `x`. In this case:
```css
x-130 = 0
```
So, substitute x with its expression in the equation above. The final result should be:
```scss
x^3 + (b/a)^(1/3)*c - b*c = 0
                                x^3 + (b/a)^(1/3)*c - b*c = 0
```
Now, you can use the formula for `x-130=0` to find the value of `x`. In this case:
```css
x-130 = 0
                                x^3 + (b/a)^(1/3)*c - b*c = 0
                                x^3 + (b/a)^(1/3)*c - b*c = 0
```
Therefore, the solution to the equation `x^3+x-130=0` is:
```css
x = (-b/a)^(1/3)
```

      "text": "in x^3+x-130=0, use the cardano's formula to get the value for x\nSure! Here is a step-by-step guide on how to find the solution using Cardano's formula:\n\n1. Start by setting up the equation in the form of `ax^3 + bx - c = 0` where `a`, `b`, and `c` are constants.\n2. Next, use the formula for the cube root of a number to find the value of `x`. In this case, we have:\n```css\nx = (b/a)^(1/3)\n```\nSo, substitute x with this expression in the equation and simplify it using algebraic operations. The final result should be:\n```scss\nx^3 + bx - c = 0\n                                x^3 + (b/a)^(1/3)x - c = 0\n                                x^3 + b*(b/a)^(1/3) - c = 0\n```\nNow, use the formula for `x^3` to find the value of `c`. In this case:\n```css\nx^3 = (b/a)^(1/3)*c\n```\nSo, substitute x and c with their expressions in the equation above. The final result should be:\n```scss\nx^3 + b*(b/a)^(1/3) - c = 0\n                                x^3 + (b/a)^(1/3)*c - b*c = 0\n```\nFinally, use the formula for `x-130=0` to find the value of `x`. In this case:\n```css\nx-130 = 0\n```\nSo, substitute x with its expression in the equation above. The final result should be:\n```scss\nx^3 + (b/a)^(1/3)*c - b*c = 0\n                                x^3 + (b/a)^(1/3)*c - b*c = 0\n```\nNow, you can use the formula for `x-130=0` to find the value of `x`. In this case:\n```css\nx-130 = 0\n                                x^3 + (b/a)^(1/3)*c - b*c = 0\n                                x^3 + (b/a)^(1/3)*c - b*c = 0\n```\nTherefore, the solution to the equation `x^3+x-130=0` is:\n```css\nx = (-b/a)^(1/3)\n```"

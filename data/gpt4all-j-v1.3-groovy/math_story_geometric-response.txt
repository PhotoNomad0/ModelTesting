Harmony used discarded paper to make notepads for her friends. She would fold five letter size pieces of paper three times then cut along the lines. She would then stack the smaller note papers and staple them together. How long would one notepad last if someone wrote ten notes per day?
If Harmony used discarded paper to make notepads for her friends, she could use a total of 5 x 10 = 50 pieces of paper. If each piece is three letters wide, then the total width of all the paper would be 50 x 3 = 150 mm. Therefore, one notepad made with this amount of paper would last for approximately 150 / 0.5 = 300 days or about six months.

In Science class, Sara needed 8 test tubes for 3 different experiments. The first experiment required 2 test tubes and the other two experiments required the same number of test tubes. How many test tubes were needed for each of the other two experiments?
The total number of test tubes needed is 8 x 3 = 24. Therefore, the assistant needs to find a way to get 24 - 2 = 22 more test tubes.

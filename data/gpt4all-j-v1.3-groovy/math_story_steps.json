Write a response that appropriately completes the request.\n\n### Instruction:\nIn Science class, Sara needed 8 test tubes for 3 different experiments. The first experiment required 2 test tubes and the other two experiments required the same number of test tubes. How many test tubes were needed for each of the other two experiments?\n\n### Response:\n\nSara needs a total of 24 test tubes (8 + 8). Since there are 3 different experiments, she will need to use 12 test tubes per experiment on average. Therefore, Sara would have used 4 tests in the first experiment and 2 tests in each other two experiments for a total of 6 tests needed."}], "created": 1692754782, "id": "foobarbaz", "model": "ggml-gpt4all-j-v1.3-groovy.bin", "object": "text_completion", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 62, "prompt_tokens": 87, "total_tokens": 149}, "time": "5.25"}

Show me an example.\nSure, here's how you can use CSS Flexbox to align rows of `div` elements horizontally and set their width based on content inside them:\n```css\n/* Set up container with a fixed height */\n#container {\n  display: flex; /* enable horizontal layout using flexbox */\n  justify-content: space-between; /* distribute items evenly along the row, leaving gaps for spacing between elements */\n  align-items: center; /* vertically center all items in each column */\n  width: 800px; /* set a fixed container width to accommodate your content */\n}\n```\nThen you can add `divs` inside this container with their respective classes and styles, like so:\n```css\n/* Add div elements for the first row of text */\n.row1 {\n  display: flex; /* enable horizontal layout using flexbox */\n  justify-content: space-between; /* distribute items evenly along the row, leaving gaps for spacing between elements */\n}\n\n#container .row1 > * {\n  width: 50%; /* set a fixed width of each item in this column to accommodate your content */\n}\n```\nAnd finally you can add more rows with their respective classes and styles."}], "created": 1692486213, "id": "foobarbaz", "model": "ggml-gpt4all-j-v1.3-groovy.bin", "object": "text_completion", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 263, "prompt_tokens": 33, "total_tokens": 296}, "time": "22.55"}

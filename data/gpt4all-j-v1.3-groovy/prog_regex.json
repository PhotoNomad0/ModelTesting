Write a response that appropriately completes the request.\n\n### Instruction:\ncreate a regex expression to extract a three character code like \"1Jn\" from a filename in format \"57-1Jn.usfm\".  The characters can be upper or lower case letters or digits. And the filename extension must be \".usfm\".\n\n### Response:\n\nHere is an example of how you could create such a regex expression using Python's `re` module:\n```python\nimport re\n\nfilename = \"57-1Jn.usfM\"  # replace with your actual filename string\npattern = r'^[a-zA-Z0-9]+\\.[a-z]{2}$'  # pattern to match the three characters code and extension, in this case: '5', '7', '1Jn'. The first character is a lowercase letter or digit.\nmatch = re.search(pattern, filename)\nif match:\n  print(\"The file exists!\")\nelse:\n  print(\"File does not exist.\")\n```"}], "created": 1693310852, "id": "foobarbaz", "model": "ggml-gpt4all-j-v1.3-groovy.bin", "object": "text_completion", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 156, "prompt_tokens": 95, "total_tokens": 251}, "time": "25.67"}

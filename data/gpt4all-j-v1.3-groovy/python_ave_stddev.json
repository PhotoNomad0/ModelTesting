You can use NumPy library for calculating averages and std deviations from lists of numbers. Here is some sample code that demonstrates how to do it: \n```python\nimport numpy as np\ndef calculate_average(numbers):\n    # Calculate the average by summing all elements in a list, dividing by number of items (length) and multiplying with 1/number of items.\n    return np.mean([x for x in numbers]) * len(numbers) / float(len(numbers))\ndef calculate_stddev(numbers):\n    # Calculate the standard deviation by taking square root of sum of all elements squared, dividing by number of items (length), and multiplying with 1/number of items.\n    return np.sqrt((np.sum([x**2 for x in numbers]) - np.mean(numbers) ** 2)) * len(numbers) / float(len(numbers))\n```"}], "created": 1688818837, "id": "foobarbaz", "model": "Groovy", "object": "text_completion", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 226, "prompt_tokens": 22, "total_tokens": 248}, "time": "10.54"}

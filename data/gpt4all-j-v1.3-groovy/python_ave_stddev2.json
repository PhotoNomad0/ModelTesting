You can call this function with any number of elements in your input list as arguments. The output will be returned as two separate arrays - one containing the average values (mean) and another array containing the square root of each element multiplied by its corresponding variance, which is used to calculate standard deviation:\n```python\nimport numpy as np\ndef mean_and_std(numbers):\n    # Calculate sum of all elements in list\n    total = 0.0\n    for num in numbers:\n        total += num\n\n    # Divide by number of elements to get average value\n    avg_value = total / len(numbers)\n\n    # Calculate variance using NumPy library\n    variances = np.var([num for _, num in enumerate(numbers)]).reshape((-1))[0]\n\n    return [avg_value], variances\n```"}], "created": 1689004284, "id": "foobarbaz", "model": "Groovy", "object": "text_completion", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 236, "prompt_tokens": 25, "total_tokens": 261}, "time": "27.30"}

Write a response that appropriately completes the request.\n\n### Instruction:\nPython program\nWrite a function named capital_indexes. The function takes a single parameter, which is a string. Your function should return a list of all the indexes in the string that have capital letters\n\n### Response:\n\nHere's an example implementation for your task using Python 3:\n```python\ndef capitalize(string):\n  # Create empty dictionary to store index values and their corresponding positions\n  indices = {}\n\n  # Iterate through each character in the string, converting it into a number representing its position within the alphabet. If the current letter is uppercase, add 1 to that value; otherwise, subtract 2 from the previous capitalized letter's value (if there was one). Add this new index and corresponding position as key-value pair to dictionary\n  for char in string:\n    if char == 'A': indices['a'] = 0\n    elif char == 'B': indices['b'] = 1\n    else: indices[char] += 2\n\n  # Create a list of all the indexes with capital letters and their corresponding positions in alphabet. Return this list as output\n  return [indices, string]\n```"}], "created": 1692755192, "id": "foobarbaz", "model": "ggml-gpt4all-j-v1.3-groovy.bin", "object": "text_completion", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 201, "prompt_tokens": 81, "total_tokens": 282}, "time": "12.41"}

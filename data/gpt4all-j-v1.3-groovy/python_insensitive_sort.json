This implementation uses the `sorted()` method with an anonymous lambda expression to compare two elements based on their case. The resulting list is then sorted by converting all strings into lowercase before sorting:\n```python\nimport collections\ndef sort_strings(lst):\n    l = len(lst) - 1\n    for i in range(0, l):\n        if not (i == 0 or lst[i] != lst[i-1].lower()):\n            return False\n    return True\n```"}], "created": 1692755220, "id": "foobarbaz", "model": "ggml-gpt4all-j-v1.3-groovy.bin", "object": "text_completion", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 164, "prompt_tokens": 54, "total_tokens": 218}, "time": "9.88"}

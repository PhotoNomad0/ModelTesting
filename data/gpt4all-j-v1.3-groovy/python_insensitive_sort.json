The code uses string methods like `lower()`, `upper()`, `findall()`, and regex patterns with capturing groups to extract parts from each input line, then sorts them by their lowercase or uppercase versions of a common substring (which is determined using the captured group).\n```python\nimport re\nfrom collections import defaultdict\ndef case_insensitive(lst):\n    # Initialize an empty dictionary to store substrings and counts for each line.\n    d = {}\n\n    # Loop through lines in input list, extract parts using regex pattern matching.\n    for i, line in enumerate(lst):\n        match_pattern = r'(\\w+)\\s+(\\d+)[^ ]*$'\n        matches = re.findall(match_pattern, line)\n\n        # If there are no matches in the current line, skip it and move on to next one.\n        if not any([m for m in matches]): continue\n\n        # Extract common substring from each match using regex pattern matching again.\n        substrings = [match[0].lower() + '_' + match[1:], match[2]]\n        for s in substrings: d[s] += 1\n\n    # Sort lines by their lowercase or uppercase versions of a common substring.\n    sorted = [line for line, count in sorted(d.items(), key=lambda x: (x[0].lower() + '_' + x[1], -count))]\n\n    return sorted\n```"}], "created": 1688818805, "id": "foobarbaz", "model": "Groovy", "object": "text_completion", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 414, "prompt_tokens": 24, "total_tokens": 438}, "time": "24.45"}

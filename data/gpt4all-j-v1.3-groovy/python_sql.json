Here's an example of how you can use SQLite in Python to retrieve all the records from a table that have a certain condition applied. In this case we want to find all the records with \"age\" greater than 32. You'll need to install `sqlite3` and create your database first:\n```python\nimport sqlite3\nfrom datetime import date, timedelta\n\n# Connect to the SQLite database file\nconn = sqlite3.connect('example_db')\ncursor = conn.cursor()\n\n# Retrieve all records where age is greater than 32 days ago from today's date\ntoday = date(2022, 1, 15)  # Today's date in YYYY-MM-DD format (e.g., 2022-01-15 for January 16th of 2022)\nage_days_ago = int((date() - today).total_seconds()) / 86400 + 32  # Calculate the number of days ago from yesterday that is greater than or equal to age in years, months and weeks (e.g., if you're 31 years old, it's less than 1 year)\nage_days = int(today - date(*date)) // timedelta(hours=1).total_seconds() + 32  # Calculate the number of days since yesterday that is greater than or equal to age in seconds (e.g., if you're 31 years old, it's less than 1 day)\nif age_days >= 0:\n    cursor.execute(\"SELECT * FROM example WHERE age > ?\", [age_days])\n```"}], "created": 1692486255, "id": "foobarbaz", "model": "ggml-gpt4all-j-v1.3-groovy.bin", "object": "text_completion", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 343, "prompt_tokens": 27, "total_tokens": 370}, "time": "23.37"}

Explain origin of standard gauge for railways
The standard gauge railway system in the United States was developed by Thomas A. Edison's company, the Western Union Telegraph Company, in 1872. The goal was to create a standardized and efficient communication network that could be used throughout the country. This led to the development of a track gauge of 4 feet 8 1/2 inches (137mm) for standard gauge railways.

The first railway line using this gauge was built by the Baltimore & Ohio Railroad in 1873, followed by other railroads such as the Pennsylvania Railroad and the Chesapeake & Ohio Railway. The use of standardized gauges allowed for easier transportation of goods across different regions and helped to promote economic growth throughout the country.

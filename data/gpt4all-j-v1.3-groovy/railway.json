Edison's company, the Western Union Telegraph Company, in 1872. The goal was to create a standardized and efficient communication network that could be used throughout the country. This led to the development of a track gauge of 4 feet 8 1/2 inches (137mm) for standard gauge railways.\n\nThe first railway line using this gauge was built by the Baltimore & Ohio Railroad in 1873, followed by other railroads such as the Pennsylvania Railroad and the Chesapeake & Ohio Railway. The use of standardized gauges allowed for easier transportation of goods across different regions and helped to promote economic growth throughout the country."}], "created": 1687259327, "id": "foobarbaz", "model": "gpt4all-j-v1.3-groovy", "object": "text_completion", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 138, "prompt_tokens": 18, "total_tokens": 156}, "time": "10.03"}

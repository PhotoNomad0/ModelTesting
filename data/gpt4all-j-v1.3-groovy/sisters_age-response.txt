when I was 6, my sister was half my age. Now I am 80. How old is my sister now? Calculate this step by step.
Sure! Let's start with the first equation: 

Age = (6 + 8) / 2 = 10 years old

Now let's calculate your current age, which we can represent as "x" in the second equation: 

Current Age = 80 - x

Substitute this expression for Current Age into the first equation to solve for x: 

10 - x = (6 + 8) / 2

Simplify and solve for x: 

10 - 10x = 14

Multiply both sides by 2 to eliminate the fraction: 

20x = 28

Divide both sides by 20 to find your age in years: 

x = 7.5

Now let's calculate your sister's current age, which we can represent as "y" in the second equation: 

Current Age = 80 - y

Substitute this expression for Current Age into the first equation to solve for y: 

10 - y = (6 + 8) / 2

Simplify and solve for y: 

10 - 10y = 14

Multiply both sides by 20 to eliminate the fraction: 

20y = 28

Divide both sides by 20 to find your sister's age in years: 

y = 7.5

So, my sister is now 75 years old!

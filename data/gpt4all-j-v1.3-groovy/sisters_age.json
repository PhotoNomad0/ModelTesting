Calculate this step by step.\nSure! Let's start with the first equation: \n\nAge = (6 + 8) / 2 = 10 years old\n\nNow let's calculate your current age, which we can represent as \"x\" in the second equation: \n\nCurrent Age = 80 - x\n\nSubstitute this expression for Current Age into the first equation to solve for x: \n\n10 - x = (6 + 8) / 2\n\nSimplify and solve for x: \n\n10 - 10x = 14\n\nMultiply both sides by 2 to eliminate the fraction: \n\n20x = 28\n\nDivide both sides by 20 to find your age in years: \n\nx = 7.5\n\nNow let's calculate your sister's current age, which we can represent as \"y\" in the second equation: \n\nCurrent Age = 80 - y\n\nSubstitute this expression for Current Age into the first equation to solve for y: \n\n10 - y = (6 + 8) / 2\n\nSimplify and solve for y: \n\n10 - 10y = 14\n\nMultiply both sides by 20 to eliminate the fraction: \n\n20y = 28\n\nDivide both sides by 20 to find your sister's age in years: \n\ny = 7.5\n\nSo, my sister is now 75 years old!"}], "created": 1687258499, "id": "foobarbaz", "model": "gpt4all-j-v1.3-groovy", "object": "text_completion", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 298, "prompt_tokens": 41, "total_tokens": 339}, "time": "27.50"}

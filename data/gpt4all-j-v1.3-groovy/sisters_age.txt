Calculate this step by step.\nTo calculate the age difference between two people at different ages, you can use the following formula:\n\nAge Difference = (Current Age - Birth Date) / 365 + ((Current Age - Birth Date) / 365)^2\n\nFor example, if a person is currently 80 years old and was born in 1900, their birth date would be January 1st, 1900. To calculate their age difference from the current age of 80, we can use the formula:\n\nAge Difference = (80 - 1900) / 365 + ((80 - 1900) / 365)^2\n= 0.0016 years old\n\nSo, my sister is currently 16 years old."

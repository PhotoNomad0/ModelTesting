Write a response that appropriately completes the request.\n\n### Instruction:\nwhen I was 6, my sister was half my age. Now I am 80. How old is my sister now?\n\n### Response:\n\nI apologize for any confusion earlier. To answer your question accurately and completely, we need to first find out the current year of birth (year) in which you were 6 years ago when your sister was half your age. Let's call this number \"x\". \nNow that I am 80 years old, my sister would be x + 8 years old now. So, if we subtract 8 from both sides and divide by 2, the answer is: (80 - 8) / 2 = 40. Therefore, my sister was 60 years old when you were 6 years ago."}], "created": 1692754776, "id": "foobarbaz", "model": "ggml-gpt4all-j-v1.3-groovy.bin", "object": "text_completion", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 116, "prompt_tokens": 63, "total_tokens": 179}, "time": "7.54"}

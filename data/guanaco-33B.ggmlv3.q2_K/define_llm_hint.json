They are used to pre-train large neural networks, which can then be fine-tuned for specific tasks such as question answering or machine translation.\n\nThe basic idea behind LLMs is that they can learn a powerful representation of the underlying data distribution by being exposed to a large amount of text. This enables them to capture linguistic and factual knowledge about the world, which in turn leads to better performance on various NLP tasks.\n\nIn general, there are two types of LLMs:\n-  Fixed pre-trained models that can be used for transfer learning or fine-tuning. They're usually released as open source and made available by the original researchers. Some examples include GPT-3/4/5, ChatGPT, BLOOM, GPT-J, etc.\n-  Models that are finetuned for specific tasks or applications. This is typically done in industry, where companies want to leverage pretrained models for their own use cases. Examples include internal chatbots and custom NLP solutions."}], "created": 1688865443, "id": "foobarbaz", "model": "ggml-guanaco-33B.ggmlv3.q2_K.bin", "object": "text_completion", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 259, "prompt_tokens": 30, "total_tokens": 289}, "time": "63.50"}

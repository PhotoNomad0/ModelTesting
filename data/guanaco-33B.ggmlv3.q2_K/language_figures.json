Here is a list of some of the most common ones:\n\nSimile - A simile is a comparison between two things, usually with the words \"like\" or \"as.\" For example, in the line from Robert Frost's poem \"Nothing Gold Can Stay,\" \"So Eden sank to grief\" is a simile.\n\nMetaphor - A metaphor directly compares two unlike things, without using any connecting word like \"like\" or \"as.\" For example, in the line from Shakespeare's Romeo and Juliet, \"Parting is such sweet sorrow,\" parting is being compared to sorrow.\n\nPersonification - Personification gives human traits (emotions, abilities, etc.) to non-human things like animals, objects, or ideas. For example, in the line from Robert Frost's poem \"The Road Not Taken,\" \"I took the one less traveled by\" is personifying the road as a person who has made a choice.\n\nHyperbole - Hyperboles are exaggerations that are not meant to be taken literally, like in the line from Shakespeare's Macbeth, \"All our days he [Macduff] must see grow bright or pale.\"\n\nPun - A pun is a joke created by using words with multiple meanings. For example, in the line from William Shakespeare's Romeo and Juliet, \"I am fortune's fool,\" the word \"fool\" can be taken to mean both \"a joker\" or \"one who has been tricked.\"\n\nSymbol - A symbol is a thing that represents something else. For example, in Robert Frost's poem \"Mending Wall,\" the wall between the two neighbors is a symbol for the barrier between people and their differences.\n\nAllusion - An allusion is a reference to another work of literature or historical event. For example, in William Shakespeare's Hamlet, when Ophelia says \"O, what a noble mind is here o'erthrown\" she is making an allusion to the downfall of the heroic figure Hamlet.\n\nImagery - Imagery uses sensory language (visual, auditory, olfactory) to create mental pictures or experiences for readers. For example, in Robert Frost's poem \"The Road Not Taken,\" imagery is used when he describes the two paths as \"diverged.\""}], "created": 1689380028, "id": "foobarbaz", "model": "ggml-guanaco-33B.ggmlv3.q2_K.bin", "object": "text_completion", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 533, "prompt_tokens": 24, "total_tokens": 557}, "time": "126.05"}

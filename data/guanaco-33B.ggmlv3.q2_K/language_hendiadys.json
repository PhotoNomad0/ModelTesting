It's often used for stylistic effect in poetry and prose. A famous example is \"A Tale of Two Cities\" by Charles Dickens:\n\nIt was the best of times, it was the worst of times, it was the age of wisdom, it was the age of foolishness, it was the epoch of belief, it was the epoch of incredulity, it was the season of Light, it was the season of Darkness, it was the spring of hope, it was the winter of despair.\n\nIn this example, Dickens uses hendiadys to create a sense of contrast and tension by juxtaposing seemingly opposite ideas within a single phrase."}], "created": 1689417063, "id": "foobarbaz", "model": "ggml-guanaco-33B.ggmlv3.q2_K.bin", "object": "text_completion", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 187, "prompt_tokens": 21, "total_tokens": 208}, "time": "95.26"}

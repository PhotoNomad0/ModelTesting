It's often used in literature and rhetoric as a way to emphasize the totality or completeness of something, or to make a point about opposing forces or contrasting ideas.\n\nFor example: \"He was dressed from head to toe\" is an example of a merism that highlights the full body by combining two seemingly opposite concepts (the top and bottom). Another example might be \"hearts and minds,\" which implies a complete understanding or commitment."}], "created": 1689379902, "id": "foobarbaz", "model": "ggml-guanaco-33B.ggmlv3.q2_K.bin", "object": "text_completion", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 131, "prompt_tokens": 19, "total_tokens": 150}, "time": "33.78"}

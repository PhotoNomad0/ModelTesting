The general form of Newton's method is:\n\n```\nx_n+1 = x_n - f(x_n)/f'(x_n)\n```\n\nIn this case, we have `f(x)=x^3 + x-130` and `f'(x)=3x^2+1`. We can plug these into the general form of Newton's method:\n\n```\nx_n+1 = x_n - (x^3 + x-130)/(3x^2+1)\n```\n\nWe can then plug in our initial guess for `x` and iterate this process until we get a good approximation of the solution. Let's use an initial guess of 5:\n\n| x_n | f(x_n) | f'(x_n) | x_n+1 |\n| ---:| ----:| ----:| -- :|\n|  5  |   62 |    30 |     4.987 |\n```\n\nWe can see that the error is now much smaller, so we have a good approximation of the solution to our equation."}], "created": 1689452857, "id": "foobarbaz", "model": "ggml-guanaco-33B.ggmlv3.q2_K.bin", "object": "text_completion", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 283, "prompt_tokens": 32, "total_tokens": 315}, "time": "143.99"}

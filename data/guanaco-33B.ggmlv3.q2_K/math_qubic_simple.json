For this problem, we can rewrite the given equation as:\n\n```x^3 - 140 x + 130 = 0```\n\nWe have:\n\n```y_0 = 130/2, y_1 = 0, y_2 = -1, y_3 = -140```\n\nNow we can use Cardano's method to find the roots. First, we need to calculate the discriminant `delta` using:\n\n```delta = (y_1)^2 + 4(y_0)(y_2) = 1^2 + 4(-1)(-1) = -5```\n\nSince delta is negative, there are no real roots. This means we need to use the complex root formula:\n\n```x_1, x_2, x_3 = (-b/2a), (1/2a)[-(b^2 - 4ac)/(2a)] [0], (1/(2a))[(b^2 - 4ac)/(2a)] [0] ```\n\nWe have:\n\n```x_1, x_2 = (-140/2), (-130/2) = -70,-65```\n\nThe final answer is `x_3 = i(-1)` where `i` is an imaginary unit."}], "created": 1688866934, "id": "foobarbaz", "model": "ggml-guanaco-33B.ggmlv3.q2_K.bin", "object": "text_completion", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 362, "prompt_tokens": 39, "total_tokens": 401}, "time": "104.05"}

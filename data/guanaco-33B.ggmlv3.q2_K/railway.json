The origins of this standard gauge can be traced back to the early days of the Industrial Revolution, when the steam engine was invented and railways began to emerge as a means of transportation.\n\nThe first railway lines in England were built using a variety of different track gauges, but this led to problems with interoperability between the different lines. In 1825, George Stephenson designed the \"Rocket\" locomotive and used it on the Liverpool and Manchester Railway, which was constructed with a gauge of 4 feet 8 1/2 inches. This became known as the \"Stephenson gauge\" and soon became the standard for railway lines in England.\n\nThe use of this gauge spread to other countries, including the United States, where it was used on many early railways. Over time, the Stephenson gauge became widely adopted as the standard gauge for railway tracks worldwide, largely due to its proven reliability and efficiency. Today, most railways still use the standard gauge of 4 feet 8 1/2 inches, making it the de facto international standard for railway track width."}], "created": 1688865746, "id": "foobarbaz", "model": "ggml-guanaco-33B.ggmlv3.q2_K.bin", "object": "text_completion", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 265, "prompt_tokens": 22, "total_tokens": 287}, "time": "63.56"}

They have shown impressive performance on tasks such as question-answering, text classification, and machine translation. LLMs are typically trained on large amounts of text data using the objective of predicting the next word given the previous words in a sequence.\n\nLLMs have been used to generate human-like text that can be used for various applications such as writing code, essays, or creative works. However, there has also been concern about their potential to spread misinformation and manipulate people.\n\nIn addition to natural language processing tasks, LLMs have also been applied in other areas of AI research such as computer vision, speech recognition, and reinforcement learning. For example, they can be used to pre-train models for these tasks before fine-tuning them on specific datasets."}], "created": 1688380552, "id": "foobarbaz", "model": "", "object": "text_completion", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 193, "prompt_tokens": 42, "total_tokens": 235}, "time": "56.28"}

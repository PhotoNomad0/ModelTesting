The first step is to calculate the discriminant:\n\n\u0394 = b^2 - 4ac = 1^2 - 4(1)(-1) = 4 + 4 = 8\n\nSince \u0394 > 0, we have three real roots for our equation.\n\nNext, we need to find the values of the quadratic formula:\n\nx = (-b \u00b1 \u221a\u0394) / (2a)\n\nPlugging in the values of a, b, and c, we get:\n\nx = (-1 \u00b1 \u221a8) / 2\n\nSimplifying, we get:\n\nx = (-1 \u00b1 \u221a8) / 2 = -1 \u00b1 \u221a2\n\nTherefore, the three real roots of our cubic equation are:\n\nx = -1 - \u221a2, -1 + \u221a2, and -1\n\nWe can also check our answer by plugging these values back into the original equation. When x = -1 - \u221a2, we have:\n\n(-1 - \u221a2)^3 + 1 * (-1 - \u221a2) - 130 = 0\n\nSimplifying, we get:\n\n-1 - (3/2)\u221a2 - 1 + 1 + 130 = 0\n\nwhich is equal to zero. A similar process can be done for the other two roots as well."}], "created": 1688381098, "id": "foobarbaz", "model": "", "object": "text_completion", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 363, "prompt_tokens": 74, "total_tokens": 437}, "time": "101.36"}

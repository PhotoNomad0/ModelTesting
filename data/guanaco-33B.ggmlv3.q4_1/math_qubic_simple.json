The steps are as follows:\n\n1. Bring the cubic equation to the form `x^3 + px = q` where `p` and `q` are constants.\n2. If the discriminant `D = (p^2)/4 - q` is negative, there are no real roots.\n3. If the discriminant is zero, the equation has one real root.\n4. If the discriminant is positive, there are three real roots.\n5. Use the following formula to find the roots:\n\n```\nx = (-b \u00b1 sqrt(b^2 - 4ac) / 2a\n```\n\nwhere `a`, `b` and `c` are coefficients of the cubic equation.\n\nIn your case, the equation is `x^3 + x - 130 = 0`.\n\nStep 1: Bring to the form `x^3 + px = q`\n\n```\nx^3 + x - 130 = 0\nx^3 = -x + 130\nx^3 + (-x) = 130\nx^3 + px = q\n```\n\nStep 2: Discriminant `D = (p^2)/4 - q`\n\n```\nD = ((-1)^2)/4 - 130\nD = -1/4 - 130\nD = -131/4\n```\n\nStep 3: The discriminant is negative, so there are no real roots.\n\nIn this case, the equation has no real roots."}], "created": 1688381200, "id": "foobarbaz", "model": "", "object": "text_completion", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 374, "prompt_tokens": 51, "total_tokens": 425}, "time": "102.10"}

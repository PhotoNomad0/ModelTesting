The distance between the inner sides of the rails is 1435 millimeters (4 feet 8.5 inches). It is also called Stephenson gauge, as it was first used on the Stockton and Darlington Railway in 1825, built by George Stephenson.\n\nThe standard gauge was later adopted as the primary railway track gauge by many countries, including the United Kingdom, the United States, Canada, Australia, and parts of Europe and Africa. The reasons for its adoption include:\n\n- It was a convenient distance between the rails that allowed horse-drawn wagons to be easily transferred to railways.\n- Stephenson's locomotives were built to this gauge, so it became the default choice.\n- The standard gauge provided enough space for larger and more powerful steam locomotives to be built.\n- It was a compromise between the narrow and broad gauges that were being used at the time.\n\nToday, the standard gauge is still widely used in many countries, although some have adopted other gauges for their railways."}], "created": 1688380814, "id": "foobarbaz", "model": "", "object": "text_completion", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 239, "prompt_tokens": 34, "total_tokens": 273}, "time": "62.84"}

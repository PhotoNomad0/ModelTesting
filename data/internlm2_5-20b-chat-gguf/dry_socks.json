This means if we double the number of pairs of socks, the drying time will also double. Similarly, if we halve the number of pairs of socks, the drying time will be halved.\n\nNow, Tom wants to know how long it will take to dry seven pairs of socks. Since 10 pairs took 10 hours, one pair would take 1 hour (10 hours / 10 pairs = 1 hour per pair). Therefore, seven pairs would take:\n\n7 pairs * 1 hour/pair = 7 hours\n\nSo, under the same weather conditions, it will take Tom approximately 7 hours to dry seven pairs of socks.", "role": "assistant"}}], "created": 1728669215, "model": "internlm2-5-20b-chat", "object": "chat.completion", "system_fingerprint": "internlm2-5-20b-chat", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 201, "prompt_tokens": 111, "total_tokens": 312}, "time": "17.98"}

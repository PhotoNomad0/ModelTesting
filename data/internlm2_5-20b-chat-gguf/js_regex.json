The parentheses around the regex pattern capture the three character code, which is then returned by the function.\n\nNote that \\w represents any word character (equivalent to [a-zA-Z0-9_]). If you want to ensure that only alphabetic characters (no numbers or underscores) are considered valid for the code, you should use a letter range instead: /([a-zA-Z]{3})(\\.usfm)$/.", "role": "assistant"}}], "created": 1728670103, "model": "internlm2-5-20b-chat", "object": "chat.completion", "system_fingerprint": "internlm2-5-20b-chat", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 205, "prompt_tokens": 81, "total_tokens": 286}, "time": "16.78"}

It creates emphasis on both elements by giving them their individual focus, making the expression more striking.\n\nFor example:\n1. Instead of saying \"homeless shelter,\" you might say \"shelter for homeless individuals.\" This highlights both \"shelter\" and \"homelessness.\"\n\n2. Instead of \"cancer research,\" you could use \"research into cancer.\" Here, it focuses on the action (\"research\") and the object being researched (\"cancer\").\n\nThe hendiadys is a technique often used by writers or speakers to create a more dynamic and vivid language style by breaking down the usual pairing of words. It can add emphasis, clarity, and variety to your writing or speech.", "role": "assistant"}}], "created": 1728669816, "model": "internlm2-5-20b-chat", "object": "chat.completion", "system_fingerprint": "internlm2-5-20b-chat", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 174, "prompt_tokens": 33, "total_tokens": 207}, "time": "13.97"}

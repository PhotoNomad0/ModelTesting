This gives us:\n\n\\[\n(2^3)^x + 2^x = 130\n\\]\n\nSimplifying the left side using the power rule \\((a^m)^n = a^{mn}\\), we get:\n\n\\[\n2^{3x} + 2^x = 130\n\\]\n\nNow, let's set \\(2^x = y\\). This substitution simplifies our equation to:\n\n\\[\ny^3 + y = 130\n\\]\n\nThis is a cubic equation. Solving cubic equations analytically can be complex and might not lead to simple roots, so we'll look for approximate solutions by inspection or numerical methods.\n\nBy inspection, \\(y = 4\\) seems close because \\(4^3 + 4 = 64 + 4 = 68\\), which is slightly less than 130. Let's try a slightly higher value:\n\nIf \\(y = 5\\), then \\(y^3 + y = 125 + 5 = 130\\).\n\nSo, \\(y = 5\\) satisfies the equation. Recalling that \\(y = 2^x\\), we have:\n\n\\[\n2^x = 5\n\\]\n\nTo solve for \\(x\\), we take the logarithm base 2 of both sides:\n\n\\[\nx = \\log_2{5}\n\\]\n\nUsing a calculator or logarithm table, we find that \\(\\log_2{5} \\approx 2.3219\\). Thus, the solution to the equation \\(8^x + 2^x = 130\\) is approximately:\n\n\\[\nx \\approx 2.3219\n\\]\n\nTo confirm this solution, we can substitute back into the original equation and check if both sides are equal (or very close):\n\nFor \\(x = 2.3219\\), \\(8^x + 2^x \\approx 130\\) holds true.\n\nTherefore, the value of \\(x\\) that satisfies the given equation is approximately \\(\\boxed{2.3219}\\).", "role": "assistant"}}], "created": 1728668637, "model": "internlm2-5-20b-chat", "object": "chat.completion", "system_fingerprint": "internlm2-5-20b-chat", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 469, "prompt_tokens": 42, "total_tokens": 511}, "time": "41.80"}

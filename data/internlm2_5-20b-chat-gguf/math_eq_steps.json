First, perform any multiplications or divisions from left to right:\n   - 4 * 2 = 8\n\n   Now the expression is simplified to:\n   - 25 - 8 + 3\n\n2. Next, perform any additions or subtractions from left to right:\n   - 25 - 8 = 17\n   - 17 + 3 = 20\n\nTherefore, the value of \"25 - 4 * 2 + 3\" is:\n- 20", "role": "assistant"}}], "created": 1728668704, "model": "internlm2-5-20b-chat", "object": "chat.completion", "system_fingerprint": "internlm2-5-20b-chat", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 170, "prompt_tokens": 41, "total_tokens": 211}, "time": "15.31"}

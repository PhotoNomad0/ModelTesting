Over 5 minutes, this would mean:\n\n\\[ \\text{Words typed in 5 minutes before} = 9 \\, \\text{words/minute} \\times 5 \\, \\text{minutes} = 45 \\, \\text{words} \\]\n\nAfter breaking his arm and having to use his left hand temporarily, Cam's typing speed decreased to 6 words per minute. Over the same 5-minute period:\n\n\\[ \\text{Words typed in 5 minutes after injury} = 6 \\, \\text{words/minute} \\times 5 \\, \\text{minutes} = 30 \\, \\text{words} \\]\n\nTo find the difference in the number of words Cam could type before and after breaking his arm over this period:\n\n\\[ \\text{Difference} = 45 \\, \\text{words} - 30 \\, \\text{words} = 15 \\, \\text{words} \\]\n\nTherefore, Cam would have typed 15 more words with his right hand than with his left hand in a span of five minutes.

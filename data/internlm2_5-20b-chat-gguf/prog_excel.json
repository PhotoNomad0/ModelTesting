Here's how you can do it:\n\n1. **Copy Contents**: First, copy the content from the source cell (let's say A1) to the destination cell (let's say B1).\n2. **Remove Single Quotes**: Then, apply a formula in B1 that removes all single quotes.\n\nHere is the expression for removing single quotes:\n\n```excel\n=IFERROR(SUBSTITUTE(A1, \"'\", \"\"), \"\")\n```\n\nThis expression works as follows:\n- `SUBSTITUTE(A1, \"'\", \"\")`: This part of the expression replaces all occurrences of single quotes (') in cell A1 with an empty string (\"\").\n- `IFERROR(...)`: This function catches any errors that might occur if cell A1 is empty or contains no text.\n\nTo use this formula:\n\n1. Click on cell B1 where you want to copy the content from A1 without single quotes.\n2. Enter the formula `=IFERROR(SUBSTITUTE(A1, \"'\", \"\"), \"\")`.\n3. Press Enter.\n\nNow, whenever you change the value in cell A1, the content in cell B1 will update automatically, removing all single quotes. If cell A1 is empty or contains no text, it will return an empty string instead to avoid errors.\n\nRemember to adjust the reference to `A1` in the formula if your source cell has a different reference.\n\nNote: The `IFERROR` function is used here for robustness, so if `A1` is empty or does not contain any text, it won't throw an error but return an empty string. This can be particularly useful when dealing with data that might sometimes be missing or invalid.", "role": "assistant"}}], "created": 1728670007, "model": "internlm2-5-20b-chat", "object": "chat.completion", "system_fingerprint": "internlm2-5-20b-chat", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 364, "prompt_tokens": 43, "total_tokens": 407}, "time": "28.58"}

Here's some Python code that calculates the average (mean) and standard deviation of a list of numbers:\n\n```python\nimport math\n\ndef calculate_average(numbers):\n    return sum(numbers) / len(numbers)\n\ndef calculate_standard_deviation(numbers):\n    n = len(numbers)\n    mean = calculate_average(numbers)\n    variance = sum([((x - mean) ** 2) for x in numbers]) / n\n    return math.sqrt(variance)\n\n# Example usage:\nnumbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]\naverage = calculate_average(numbers)\nstandard_deviation = calculate_standard_deviation(numbers)\nprint(f\"Average: {average}\")\nprint(f\"Standard deviation: {standard_deviation}\")\n```\n\nIn this code, we first define two functions - `calculate_average` and `calculate_standard_deviation`. The `calculate_average` function takes a list of numbers as input, adds them up using the built-in `sum()` function, and divides by the number of elements in the list (using the built-in `len()` function) to get the average.\n\nThe `calculate_standard_deviation` function takes a list of numbers as input, calculates the mean using the `calculate_average` function we just defined, then calculates the variance by summing up the squared differences between each number and the mean, dividing by the number of elements in the list, and finally taking the square root to get the standard deviation.\n\nTo use this code with your own data, you can replace the `numbers` variable with your list of numbers. The `average` and `standard_deviation` variables will then contain the calculated values for your data.", "role": "assistant"}}], "created": 1728669168, "model": "internlm2-5-20b-chat", "object": "chat.completion", "system_fingerprint": "internlm2-5-20b-chat", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 339, "prompt_tokens": 38, "total_tokens": 377}, "time": "28.71"}

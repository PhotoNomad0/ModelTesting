Sympy can handle symbolic computation and provides function `solve` which returns all roots of the equation.\n\n```python\nimport sympy as sp\n\n# define variable\nx = sp.symbols('x')\n\n# coefficients a, b, c, d\na = 1  # replace with desired value\nb = -2  # replace with desired value\nc = 1  # replace with desired value\nd = 1  # replace with desired value\n\n# define the equation\nequation = a*x**3 + b*x**2 + c*x + d\n\n# solve the equation\nsolutions = sp.solve(equation, x)\n\nprint(\"The solutions are:\")\nfor i in range(len(solutions)):\n    print(f\"x{i+1} = {solutions[i]}\")\n```\nRemember to replace `a, b, c, d` with your actual coefficients of the equation. This program will print all roots of the cubic equation.\n\nPlease note that this approach uses a symbolic solver and it can find both real and complex roots. The roots are computed using various algorithm depending on the degree of the polynomial. For high-degree polynomials, the algorithms can be computationally expensive.", "role": "assistant"}}], "created": 1728669071, "model": "internlm2-5-20b-chat", "object": "chat.completion", "system_fingerprint": "internlm2-5-20b-chat", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 266, "prompt_tokens": 51, "total_tokens": 317}, "time": "22.70"}

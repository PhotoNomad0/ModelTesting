Here's an example of such a function:\n\n```python\nimport re\n\ndef extract_code(filename):\n    try:\n        pattern = r\"\\b[A-Za-z0-9]{3}\\b\\.usfm$\"\n        match = re.search(pattern, filename)\n\n        if match:\n            return match.group(0)[:-4]  # Returning the 3 character code\n        else:\n            return None\n    except Exception as e:\n        print(f\"An error occurred: {e}\")\n        return None\n```\n\nIn this function, a regex pattern is defined to match exactly three characters (letters or digits) followed by \".usfm\". `re.search` is used to find the pattern in the filename. If a match is found, the 3 character code including the extension is returned by `match.group(0)` and the \".usfm\" part is stripped off by `[:-4]`. If no match is found or during any exception, None is returned.\n\nYou can test this function with various filenames like so:\n\n```python\nprint(extract_code(\"57-1Jn.usfm\"))  # Should print: 1Jn\nprint(extract_code(\"123-usfm\"))    # Should print: None\nprint(extract_code(\"error.usfm\"))  # Should print: None\n```\nRemember, this function will handle any exceptions that occur during execution. Any error messages will be printed and the function will return None.", "role": "assistant"}}], "created": 1728670148, "model": "internlm2-5-20b-chat", "object": "chat.completion", "system_fingerprint": "internlm2-5-20b-chat", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 319, "prompt_tokens": 91, "total_tokens": 410}, "time": "27.62"}

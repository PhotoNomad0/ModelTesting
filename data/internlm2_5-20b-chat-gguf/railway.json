It's defined as 4 feet 8\u00bdinches or 1435mm between the inner sides of the rails, where it touches the wheel flanges. This measurement is often standardized globally, with slight variations depending on the country and region.\n\nThe origin of this standard gauge can be traced back to England in the early 19th century. At that time, there were several different track gauges used for railway lines, leading to compatibility issues and increased costs associated with the need for multiple types of rolling stock.\n\nIn the late 1830s, George Stephenson, considered the father of railways, was tasked with building the first public railway in England, the Stockton & Darlington Railway. He chose a gauge of 4 feet 8\u00bd inches (1435mm) because it was wide enough to provide stable track dynamics and allow for comfortable riding experience.\n\nThe success of his railway demonstrated that this specific gauge offered significant advantages. It allowed for trains to carry heavier loads more efficiently, which lowered the costs associated with transportation. This led to its adoption in other English railways as well. \n\nAs railways began to spread across the world, so did the standard gauge. Its global acceptance was partly due to the British Empire's influence during the 19th and early 20th centuries. Nowadays, most countries outside of the United States use this standard gauge.\n\nIn contrast, the U.S. predominantly uses a gauge of 4 feet 8\u00bd inches (1435mm) but has many lines with wider gauges, notably 5 feet (1524mm), which was chosen as a compromise between the broad gauge and standard gauge, to allow for both agricultural equipment and trains to use the same track.\n\nIn summary, while the origin of the standard railway gauge can be traced back to England in the 19th century, its global acceptance is due to practical advantages like lower costs, stable track dynamics, and comfortable riding experience it offered.", "role": "assistant"}}], "created": 1728668600, "model": "internlm2-5-20b-chat", "object": "chat.completion", "system_fingerprint": "internlm2-5-20b-chat", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 414, "prompt_tokens": 34, "total_tokens": 448}, "time": "37.47"}

Sally has 3 brothers.\n2. Each brother has 2 sisters.\n\nNow, let's answer the question: \"How many sisters does Sally have?\"\n\nTo determine this, we need to consider that each of Sally's brothers also counts as one of her siblings (both brothers and sisters). Since there are 3 brothers, they count as additional 3 people in the total sibling count. However, since these same 3 brothers are counted again as having 2 sisters each, it means they are not part of Sally's family but rather from another family.\n\nSo, we need to find out how many of Sally's siblings are actually her sisters. Since every brother has 2 sisters, this doesn't directly relate to the number of sisters that Sally herself has. The information provided about brothers' sisters seems unrelated or possibly a misinterpretation in the question setup. \n\nThus, based on the information provided and assuming no further contextual errors, we cannot accurately determine how many sisters Sally has just from the given facts. We would need additional details to answer this question correctly.\n\nIn summary:\n- If considering only the siblings relationship, there are 3 brothers + unknown number of sisters = total siblings. Without knowing the total count or the distribution, it's not possible to calculate.\n- The information about each brother having 2 sisters seems disconnected without context linking them to Sally's family specifically.\n\nGiven this confusion in the question setup, a more precise answer requires clarifying details on Sally's family structure.", "role": "assistant"}}], "created": 1728668758, "model": "internlm2-5-20b-chat", "object": "chat.completion", "system_fingerprint": "internlm2-5-20b-chat", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 312, "prompt_tokens": 46, "total_tokens": 358}, "time": "26.21"}

This would mean that besides Sally, there is exactly 1 other sister (since each brother has 2 sisters total and including Sally makes it 3 people counted in total for brothers' sisters).\n\n**Scenario 2: Excluding Sally**\nIf the \"2 sisters\" excludes Sally, then we must consider how many additional sisters exist beyond Sally. Each of Sally's 3 brothers has 2 sisters who are not Sally. This means that there are \\(3 \\times 2 = 6\\) sister-counts among her brothers, but these counts don't include Sally.\n\nGiven the information:\n- If scenario 1 is correct (including Sally), then besides Sally, there should be exactly one other sister.\n- If scenario 2 is correct (excluding Sally), we would have a discrepancy since each brother having 2 sisters would imply at least one more sister beyond Sally, making it unclear without further context how many additional sisters exist.\n\nGiven the typical interpretation in such problems and without additional context suggesting an unconventional family structure, it's most logical to assume that the \"2 sisters\" per brother includes Sally. Therefore:\n\n- Sally has 3 brothers.\n- Each of these brothers considers her as one of their 2 sisters (including herself).\n\nThus, Sally has **1** sister beyond herself.\n\nHowever, since the question directly asks how many sisters Sally has and considering typical family structures where siblings are counted uniquely by individual relationships, it's reasonable to conclude that Sally has:\n\n**0 additional sisters** if we strictly interpret each brother having 2 unique sisters (who might be excluding Sally from their count). This would mean her only sister is herself.\n\nTherefore, the answer to how many sisters Sally has, considering typical interpretations and no further information provided, is **0 additional sisters beyond herself**.", "role": "assistant"}}], "created": 1728668828, "model": "internlm2-5-20b-chat", "object": "chat.completion", "system_fingerprint": "internlm2-5-20b-chat", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 501, "prompt_tokens": 49, "total_tokens": 550}, "time": "42.85"}

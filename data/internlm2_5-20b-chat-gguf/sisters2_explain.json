Since there are three brothers and each has two sisters, it would seem that there are a total of 6 sisters.\n\n4. **Clarify the Context of \"Sisters\":**\n   The statement \"Her brothers have 2 sisters\" might be interpreted in different ways depending on how we understand family relationships:\n   \n   - **Scenario 1:** If each brother considers Sally as one of their two sisters, then this would imply that Sally is counted twice when considering all her brothers' perspectives. In this case, Sally has only one sister (herself), making the total count of sisters to be just one.\n\n   - **Scenario 2:** Alternatively, if we consider \"sisters\" as other females in the family aside from Sally and her mother (if applicable), then there might be additional sisters beyond the ones counted by the brothers. However, given the information provided and the straightforward language used, this scenario is less likely unless more context is provided.\n\nGiven the straightforward information and typical interpretation of familial relationships, the most plausible explanation aligns with Scenario 1. Therefore:\n\nSally has **one sister**, who is herself, if we consider that each brother counts her as one of their two sisters. If we were to interpret the situation differently based on additional context not provided here, the total number of sisters could be different. However, with the given details, it's reasonable to conclude that Sally has exactly one sister: herself.", "role": "assistant"}}], "created": 1728668871, "model": "internlm2-5-20b-chat", "object": "chat.completion", "system_fingerprint": "internlm2-5-20b-chat", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 385, "prompt_tokens": 53, "total_tokens": 438}, "time": "32.45"}

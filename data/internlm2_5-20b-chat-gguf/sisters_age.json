When you were 6 years old, your sister was half your age. Therefore, at that time, she would have been 3 years old.\n\n2. As you both have aged over time, the difference in your ages remains constant. So now, as you are 80 years old, let's determine her current age using this constant difference.\n   \n3. Your sister was always 6 - 3 = 3 years younger than you. This means that even today, she is still 3 years younger than you.\n\n4. Therefore, to find your sister's current age, subtract the same age difference from your own current age:\n   Your sister's current age = Your current age (80) - The constant age difference (3)\n\n5. Performing this subtraction gives us: 80 - 3\n\nSo let me calculate that for you.\n```python\nsister_age_now = 80 - 3\nsister_age_now\n```", "role": "assistant"}}], "created": 1728668441, "model": "internlm2-5-20b-chat", "object": "chat.completion", "system_fingerprint": "internlm2-5-20b-chat", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 207, "prompt_tokens": 57, "total_tokens": 264}, "time": "19.23"}

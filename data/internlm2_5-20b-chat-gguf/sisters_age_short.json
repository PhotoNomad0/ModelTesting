When you were both children (at ages 6 and half that), the difference in your ages remains consistent. Your sister is always half your age.\n2. At age 6, you were 12 years older than your sister (since she was then at 3).\n3. Fast forward to today where you are now 80 years old; if this pattern held true through adulthood, your sister would be 40 years old today.\n\nHowever, we need to consider the fact that while you've aged naturally, it's not realistic for someone to have lived for over 70 years and still be half their age. Your sister should have aged as well, maintaining an appropriate gap between ages.\n\nConsidering a more likely scenario:\n\n1. Assuming both of you aged normally since childhood:\n2. If your current age is now 80, back then when you were each at the start of your respective adult lives, you'd be around 6 years apart.\n3. At 80, if she was ever half your age (which would have been a fleeting moment), it's unlikely to still maintain that exact ratio as both have aged.\n\nWithout more details about life events or timelines that may have altered the usual aging process, we can't give an accurate current age for your sister based on 'being half my age'. But considering normal life expectancy and consistent gap in ages, she would be around 40 years old today.", "role": "assistant"}}], "created": 1728668460, "model": "internlm2-5-20b-chat", "object": "chat.completion", "system_fingerprint": "internlm2-5-20b-chat", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 301, "prompt_tokens": 51, "total_tokens": 352}, "time": "26.39"}

Sally has 3 brothers.\n2. Her brothers each have 2 sisters.\n\nGiven that Sally is one of these brothers' sisters (since her brothers are part of her family), we need to calculate the total number of sisters based on the given data.\n\nIf each of Sally's brothers has exactly 2 sisters, and they have no additional sisters beyond what is accounted for by their own relationships with other people in the family, then the \"2 sisters\" per brother refers to counting Sally herself as one sister per brother. Therefore, if Sally is counted once for each of her 3 brothers, she would be counted as having 3 sisters (herself counted once for each brother).\n\nHowever, this interpretation might seem counterintuitive because it suggests that Sally has no other sisters besides herself. The phrasing \"brothers have 2 sisters\" could lead to confusion if one interprets it in a way that includes all of the family's female members.\n\nIf we instead assume that the statement means each brother (excluding Sally) shares exactly 2 other sisters with Sally, then we would need to re-evaluate the relationship dynamics. In this case, since there are no other siblings mentioned besides the brothers and the implied sisters, it suggests a very basic family structure where no additional siblings exist outside of these relationships.\n\nGiven typical sibling counting conventions (where each child is counted once), if Sally's 3 brothers each have exactly 2 sisters, excluding Sally herself, this could imply that there are two other women in the family who are the shared sisters of her three brothers. In a basic interpretation, where no additional siblings are implied or exist outside these relationships, and considering only immediate familial relationships, it would mean that beyond counting herself once for each brother's 2 \"sisters\", Sally doesn't have any other unique sisters.\n\nThis leads to an apparent contradiction in the phrasing of the question. If we strictly interpret the statement that her brothers have 2 sisters (excluding Sally), then logically, besides Sally, there are no additional sisters in this family structure based on the information given.\n\nIn conclusion, if we consider only the immediate siblings and without any extended interpretation beyond these relationships, Sally has no other distinct sisters. The question's phrasing creates ambiguity that may suggest a different family structure or additional context not provided here. Therefore, strictly interpreted with the given data, Sally has 0 unique sisters besides herself when counted once per brother.", "role": "assistant"}}], "created": 1728668784, "model": "internlm2-5-20b-chat", "object": "chat.completion", "system_fingerprint": "internlm2-5-20b-chat", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 513, "prompt_tokens": 50, "total_tokens": 563}, "time": "43.50"}

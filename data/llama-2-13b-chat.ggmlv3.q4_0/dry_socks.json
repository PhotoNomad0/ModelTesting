I'd be happy to help you with that question. Based on the information provided, we can assume that the weather conditions are the same as when Tom hung the socks outside to dry earlier.\n\nIf it took 10 hours for the socks to dry in the previous scenario, we can estimate that it will take approximately the same amount of time for the seven pairs of socks to dry.\n\nTherefore, it will take Tom approximately 10 hours to dry seven pairs of socks under the same weather conditions."}, "finish_reason": "stop"}], "usage": {"prompt_tokens": 0, "completion_tokens": 112, "total_tokens": 112}, "time": "18.43"}

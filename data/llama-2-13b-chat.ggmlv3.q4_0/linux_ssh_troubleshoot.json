Here are some possible reasons why you might be receiving this error:\n\n1. Incorrect private key file: The `-i` option specifies the path to your private key file, but the file may not exist or may not be in the correct location. Make sure that the file path is correct and that the file exists.\n2. Permissions on the private key file: The private key file may have incorrect permissions, preventing SSH from accessing it. Try running the command with `sudo` to gain elevated privileges and fix any permission issues.\n3. Incorrect username or hostname: Make sure that you are using the correct username and hostname for your EC2 instance. You can verify this information in the AWS Management Console or by running the command `ssh-keyscan -t rsa,dsa,ecdsa,ed25519 <EC2_instance_ip>` to see the available keys for the instance.\n4. Firewall restrictions: Your firewall may be blocking the SSH connection. Check your firewall settings to ensure that port 22 (the default SSH port) is allowed inbound and outbound traffic.\n5. EC2 instance configuration: The EC2 instance may have a different SSH configuration, such as a different port or key file, that is preventing the connection. You can check the SSH configuration for your instance in the AWS Management Console.\n\nTo troubleshoot this issue, you can try the following steps:\n\n1. Verify that your private key file exists and has the correct permissions.\n2. Check the SSH configuration for your EC2 instance to ensure that it is correctly configured.\n3. Try connecting to the instance using a different username or hostname.\n4. Ensure that port 22 is allowed inbound and outbound traffic on your firewall.\n5. If none of these steps resolve the issue, you may need to contact AWS Support for further assistance."}, "finish_reason": "stop"}], "usage": {"prompt_tokens": 0, "completion_tokens": 438, "total_tokens": 438}, "time": "59.85"}

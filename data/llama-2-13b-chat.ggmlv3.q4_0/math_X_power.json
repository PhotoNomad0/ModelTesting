Here's one way to approach it:\nYou could try using the formula X + Y = Z, where X and Y are variables that represent the unknowns, and Z is the known. This will give you a starting point to work from. From there, you can start working on finding solutions for X. Good luck with your problem-solving endeavors!"}], "created": 1690981009, "id": "foobarbaz", "model": "ggml-llama-2-13b-chat.ggmlv3.q4_0.bin", "object": "text_completion", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 91, "prompt_tokens": 32, "total_tokens": 123}, "time": "12.53"}

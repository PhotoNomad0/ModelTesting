I'd be happy to help you with that. Let's see... if Emily created 9 designs and used a total of 63 cereal bits, then each design must have had 7 cereal bits (63 / 9 = 7).\n\nAs for whether Emily used an equal number of cereal bits in each design, we can't say for sure without more information. However, since she only had 7 cereal bits to work with in each design, it's likely that she didn't use the exact same number of bits in each one. Maybe some designs required more bits than others? We'll have to leave that as a mystery for now!"}, "finish_reason": "stop"}], "usage": {"prompt_tokens": 0, "completion_tokens": 153, "total_tokens": 153}, "time": "22.66"}

I'd be happy to help you with that. \ud83d\ude0a\n\nTo find the value of x using Cardano's Formula, we need to first find the discriminant of the cubic equation:\n\n\u0394 = (b^2 - 4ac)^(3/2)\n\nIn this case, a = 1, b = 0, c = 1, and d = -130, so we have:\n\n\u0394 = (0 - 4(1)(-130))^(3/2)\n= (-520)^(3/2)\n= 27\n\nNow we can use Cardano's Formula to find the three solutions for x:\n\nx = (-b \u00b1 sqrt(\u0394)) / 3a\n\nx = (-0 \u00b1 sqrt(27)) / 3(1)\n= (\u00b1sqrt(27)) / 3\n= (\u00b13) / 3\n= 1 or -2\n\nSo, the three solutions for x are x = 1, x = -2, and x = -1. \ud83d\ude0a"}, "finish_reason": "stop"}], "usage": {"prompt_tokens": 0, "completion_tokens": 247, "total_tokens": 247}, "time": "33.49"}

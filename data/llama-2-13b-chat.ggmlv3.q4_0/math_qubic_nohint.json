I'd be happy to help you solve that equation. Here's how we can do it:\n\nFirst, let's try to factor the left-hand side of the equation:\n\nx^3 + x - 130 = (x + 1)(x - 13) = 0\n\nGreat! Now we have a factorization of the equation. We can set each factor equal to 0 and solve for x:\n\nx + 1 = 0 --> x = -1\n\nx - 13 = 0 --> x = 13\n\nSo, the solutions to the equation are x = -1 and x = 13.\n\nIs there anything else you'd like me to help with?"}, "finish_reason": "stop"}], "usage": {"prompt_tokens": 0, "completion_tokens": 165, "total_tokens": 165}, "time": "20.21"}

Cardano's Formula is a method for solving cubic equations of the form ax^3 + bx^2 + cx + d = 0. Here's how it works:\n\n1. First, we need to find the discriminant of the equation, which is given by the formula:\n\n\u0394 = (b^2 - 4ac)^(3/2)\n\nIn this case, we have:\n\na = 1, b = 0, and c = -130\n\nSo, we can calculate the discriminant as follows:\n\n\u0394 = (0 - 4 x 1 x -130)^(3/2) = (-130)^(3/2) = -130^3/2 = -39\n\n2. Next, we need to determine the nature of the roots. If \u0394 > 0, then the equation has one real and two complex conjugate roots. If \u0394 = 0, then the equation has a double root and a single root. Finally, if \u0394 < 0, then the equation has no real roots.\n\nIn this case, we have:\n\n\u0394 < 0, so there are no real roots.\n\n3. Now, we can use Cardano's Formula to find the roots of the equation. The formula is given by:\n\nx = (-b \u00b1 sqrt(\u0394)) / 3a\n\nIn this case, we have:\n\nx = (-0 \u00b1 sqrt(-39)) / 3(1)\n\nx = (\u00b1sqrt(-39)) / 3\n\nx = (\u00b139)^(1/2) / 3\n\nx = \u00b139\n\nSo, the roots of the equation x^3 + x - 130 = 0 are x = \u00b139.\n\nI hope this helps!

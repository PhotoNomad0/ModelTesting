I'd be happy to help you with that question.\n\nBefore Cam broke his right arm, he was able to type 9 words per minute on his phone. That means he could type 9 x 5 = 45 words in 5 minutes.\n\nAfter he broke his arm and had to use his left hand, he could only type 6 words per minute. That means he could type 6 x 5 = 30 words in 5 minutes.\n\nSo, the difference between the number of words he could type in 5 minutes before and after he broke his arm is:\n\n45 - 30 = 15 words."}, "finish_reason": "stop"}], "usage": {"prompt_tokens": 0, "completion_tokens": 144, "total_tokens": 144}, "time": "21.62"}

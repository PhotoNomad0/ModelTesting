Here's an expression you can use in LibreOffice Calc to copy the contents of one cell and remove all single quotes:\n\n=SUBSTITUTE(A1,\"'\",\"\")\n\nIn this expression, \"A1\" refers to the cell that contains the text you want to modify. The \"SUBSTITUTE\" function replaces all occurrences of the single quote character (\"'\") with an empty string (\"\").\n\nHere's how you can use this expression:\n\n1. Select the cell where you want to paste the modified text (e.g., cell B2).\n2. Enter the following formula in the \"Formula\" bar: =SUBSTITUTE(A1,\"'\",\"\")\n3. Press Enter to apply the formula and copy the contents of cell A1 to cell B2, removing all single quotes.\n\nNote that if you want to remove all special characters (including single quotes, double quotes, and escape characters), you can use the following expression instead:\n\n=SUBSTITUTE(A1,\"['\\\"]\",\"\")\n\nThis expression replaces all occurrences of any special character with an empty string."}, "finish_reason": "stop"}], "usage": {"prompt_tokens": 0, "completion_tokens": 249, "total_tokens": 249}, "time": "31.67"}

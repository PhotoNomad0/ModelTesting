Here's a regex expression that should match your desired code:\n```\n\\b(?<code>[\\w]{3})\\b\n```\nHere's how it works:\n\n* `\\b` matches a word boundary, ensuring that the code is not preceded or followed by any other characters.\n* `(?<code>[\\w]{3})` is a named capture group that matches exactly three characters (letters, digits, or underscores) that are not word characters (i.e., they are not whitespace or punctuation). The `{3}` indicates that we want exactly three of these characters.\n* `\\b` again matches a word boundary, ensuring that the code is not part of a larger word.\n\nHere's an example of how this regex expression might match your desired code in the given filename:\n```\n57-1Jn.usfm\n```\nIn this example, the regex expression would match the code \"1Jn\" and return it as a captured group named \"code\".\n\nNote that this regex expression will only match filenames with the exact format you specified (i.e., \"57-[3 character code].usfm\"). If you need to match a wider range of filenames, you may need to adjust the expression accordingly."}, "finish_reason": "stop"}], "usage": {"prompt_tokens": 0, "completion_tokens": 280, "total_tokens": 280}, "time": "37.20"}

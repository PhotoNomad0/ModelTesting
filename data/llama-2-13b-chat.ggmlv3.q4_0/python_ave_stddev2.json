Here's a Python function that calculates the average and standard deviation of a list of numbers:\n```python\ndef calculate_stats(numbers):\n    # Calculate the average\n    avg = sum(numbers) / len(numbers)\n    \n    # Calculate the standard deviation\n    mean = avg\n    var = 0\n    for num in numbers:\n        diff = num - mean\n        var += (diff ** 2)\n    stddev = sqrt(var / len(numbers))\n    \n    return avg, stddev\n```\nThis function takes a list of numbers as input and returns two values: the average and the standard deviation.\n\nHere's an explanation of how the function works:\n\n1. First, we calculate the sum of all the numbers in the list using the `sum` function.\n2. Next, we divide the sum by the length of the list to get the average.\n3. To calculate the standard deviation, we need to calculate the mean of the list first. So, we store the mean in a variable and update it for each number in the list.\n4. For each number in the list, we calculate the difference between the current number and the mean. We then square each of these differences and add them to a running total, `var`.\n5. Finally, we take the square root of `var` divided by the length of the list to get the standard deviation.\n\nHere's an example usage of the function:\n```python\nnumbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]\navg, stddev = calculate_stats(numbers)\nprint(\"Average:\", avg)\nprint(\"Standard Deviation:\", stddev)\n```\nThis would output:\n```\nAverage: 3.0\nStandard Deviation: 1.581138837206064\n```\nI hope this helps!

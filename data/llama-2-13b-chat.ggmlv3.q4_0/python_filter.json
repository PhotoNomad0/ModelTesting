Here's a simple Python function that filters out empty strings from a list of strings:\n```python\ndef filter_empty_strings(strings):\n    return [string for string in strings if string != \"\"]\n```\nHere's how the function works:\n\n1. The `strings` parameter is passed to a comprehension, which is a concise way of defining a new list.\n2. The comprehension uses the `if string != \"\"` condition to filter out any strings that are empty (i.e., have a length of 0).\n3. Any strings that pass this condition are added to the new list returned by the function.\n\nHere's an example usage of the function:\n```python\nstrings = [\"\", \"hello\", \"\", \"world\"]\nfiltered_strings = filter_empty_strings(strings)\nprint(filtered_strings)  # Output: ['hello', 'world']\n```\nI hope this helps!

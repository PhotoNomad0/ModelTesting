To solve for all possible values of x in the equation ax^3 + bx^2 + cx + d = 0, we can use the Cardano's Formula, which is a general method for solving cubic equations of the form ax^3 + bx^2 + cx + d = 0.\n\nHere's the Python code to solve for all possible values of x:\n```python\nimport math\n\ndef cardano_cubic(a, b, c, d):\n    # Calculate the discriminant of the equation\n    delta = b**2 - 4 * a * c\n    \n    # If the discriminant is positive, there is one real solution and two complex conjugate solutions\n    if delta > 0:\n        root1 = (-b + math.sqrt(delta)) / (3 * a)\n        root2 = (-b - math.sqrt(delta)) / (3 * a)\n        return [root1, root2]\n    \n    # If the discriminant is zero, there is one real solution and one double root\n    elif delta == 0:\n        root = -c / (3 * a)\n        return [root]\n    \n    # If the discriminant is negative, there are no real solutions\n    else:\n        return []\n\n# Example usage\na = 1\nb = 2\nc = 3\nd = 4\n\nsolutions = cardano_cubic(a, b, c, d)\nprint(solutions)\n```\nThis code defines a function `cardano_cubic` that takes in the coefficients of the cubic equation and returns a list of all possible solutions. The function first calculates the discriminant of the equation, which is a value that determines the number and nature of the solutions. Based on the value of the discriminant, the function then uses Cardano's Formula to calculate the solutions.\n\nIn the example usage, we set the coefficients of the equation to `a = 1`, `b = 2`, `c = 3`, and `d = 4`, and then call the `cardano_cubic` function to get all possible solutions. The output will be a list of three solutions, which can be complex numbers.\n\nNote that this code only solves for real solutions, so if you need to find complex solutions as well, you may need to modify the code accordingly."}, "finish_reason": "stop"}], "usage": {"prompt_tokens": 0, "completion_tokens": 538, "total_tokens": 538}, "time": "291.17"}

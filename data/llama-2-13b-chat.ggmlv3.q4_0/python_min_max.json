Here's the Python code for the `largest_difference` function:\n```python\ndef largest_difference(numbers):\n    max_num = max(numbers)\n    min_num = min(numbers)\n    return max_num - min_num\n```\nThis function first uses the `max()` and `min()` functions to find the largest and smallest numbers in the list, respectively. It then computes the difference between these two numbers and returns it as the result of the function.\n\nHere's an example usage of the function:\n```python\nnumbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]\nresult = largest_difference(numbers)\nprint(result) # Output: 4\n```\nIn this example, the list `numbers` contains the numbers 1 through 5. The `largest_difference` function computes the difference between the largest number (5) and the smallest number (1), which is 4. This result is then printed to the console."}, "finish_reason": "stop"}], "usage": {"prompt_tokens": 0, "completion_tokens": 225, "total_tokens": 225}, "time": "29.88"}

I'd be happy to help you with that. Here is a Python program that prints out the first 100 prime numbers:\n```\n# Define a function to check if a number is prime\ndef is_prime(n):\n  if n <= 1:\n    return False\n  for i in range(2, int(n ** 0.5) + 1):\n    if n % i == 0:\n      return False\n  return True\n\n# Define a list to store the prime numbers\nprimes = []\n\n# Iterate over the numbers from 2 to 100\nfor i in range(2, 101):\n  # Check if the current number is prime\n  if is_prime(i):\n    # If it's prime, add it to the list\n    primes.append(i)\n\n# Print out the first 100 prime numbers\nprint(primes[:100])\n```\nThis program uses a function called `is_prime` to check if a given number is prime. The function iterates over the numbers from 2 to the square root of the given number, and checks if the current number is divisible by any of these numbers. If it's not divisible, it must be prime.\n\nThe program then uses a list to store the prime numbers, and iterates over the numbers from 2 to 100 to add each prime number to the list. Finally, it prints out the first 100 prime numbers using a slice of the list.\n\nI hope this helps!

Here is a Python function that reads data from an Excel spreadsheet using the `openpyxl` library:\n```\nimport openpyxl\n\ndef read_excel(file_path):\n    \"\"\"\n    Reads data from an Excel spreadsheet located at the specified file path.\n    \n    Args:\n        file_path (str): The file path of the Excel spreadsheet.\n    \n    Returns:\n        list[list]: A list of lists containing the data from the Excel spreadsheet.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Load the Excel spreadsheet into memory using openpyxl\n    wb = openpyxl.load_workbook(file_path)\n    sheet = wb['Sheet1']\n    \n    # Return a list of lists containing the data from the Excel spreadsheet\n    return [list(row) for row in sheet.iter_rows(values_only=True)]\n```\nThis function takes in the file path of an Excel spreadsheet as input, loads the spreadsheet into memory using the `openpyxl` library, and then returns a list of lists containing the data from the spreadsheet. The `iter_rows()` method is used to iterate over each row in the sheet, and the `values_only=True` parameter is set to True to only return the values (i.e., the cells) in each row, rather than the entire row objects.\n\nHere's an example of how you could use this function:\n```\n# Load the Excel spreadsheet into memory\nwb = openpyxl.load_workbook('example.xlsx')\n\n# Get the data from the first sheet in the workbook\ndata = read_excel(wb['Sheet1'])\n\n# Print the data\nprint(data)\n```\nThis code would load an Excel spreadsheet located at `example.xlsx` into memory, and then print the data from the first sheet in the workbook (which is assumed to be the only sheet in the workbook). The output would be a list of lists containing the data from the spreadsheet, with each sublist representing a row in the spreadsheet.\n\nI hope this helps! Let me know if you have any questions or need further assistance."}, "finish_reason": "stop"}], "usage": {"prompt_tokens": 0, "completion_tokens": 483, "total_tokens": 483}, "time": "60.50"}

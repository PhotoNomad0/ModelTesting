I'd be happy to help you with that. Here's a Python function that reads data from a Google Sheets document:\n```python\nimport google.auth\nfrom googleapiclient.discovery import build\nfrom googleapiclient.errors import HttpError\nfrom google.oauth2.credentials import Credentials\nfrom google.sheets import SheetsService\n\ndef read_spreadsheet(spreadsheet_id, sheet_name):\n    # Set up authentication\n    creds = None\n    if creds is None or not creds.valid:\n        if creds and creds.expired and creds.refresh_token:\n            creds.refresh(Request())\n        else:\n            creds = google.auth.get_credentials()\n            creds.authorize(scopes=[\"https://www.googleapis.com/auth/spreadsheets\"])\n    service = build(\"sheets\", \"v4\", credentials=creds)\n\n    # Set up the sheet and range to read from\n    sheet = service.spreadsheets().values().get(spreadsheetId=spreadsheet_id, range=sheet_name).execute()\n\n    # Extract the data from the response\n    data = []\n    for row in sheet[\"values\"]:\n        data.append(row)\n\n    return data\n```\nThis function takes two parameters: `spreadsheet_id` and `sheet_name`. It uses the Google Sheets API to read the data from the specified sheet and returns a list of lists containing the data.\n\nTo use this function, you'll need to have the `google-auth` and `google-api-python-client` libraries installed. You can install them using pip:\n```\npip install google-auth google-api-python-client\n```\nYou'll also need to set up authentication with your Google Sheets account by following the instructions in the documentation for the `google.auth` module.\n\nOnce you have authentication set up, you can call the function like this:\n```python\ndata = read_spreadsheet(\"your-spreadsheet-id\", \"your-sheet-name\")\nprint(data)\n```\nThis will print the data from the specified sheet in your Google Sheets document.\n\nI hope that helps! Let me know if you have any questions or need further assistance."}, "finish_reason": "stop"}], "usage": {"prompt_tokens": 0, "completion_tokens": 517, "total_tokens": 517}, "time": "64.39"}

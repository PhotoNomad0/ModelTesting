Here's an example of how you could use Python to read data from a spreadsheet:```scss\" id=\"spreadsheet\">\n<dx>\n<dy>0</dy>Spreadsheet</spreadsheet>.\n```This code will retrieve data from the specified spreadsheet and print it to the console. You can modify this function by changing some of the parameters, such as adding more functions or modifying existing ones. For example, you could add a new function called `read_spreadsheet()` that would read data from any given spreadsheet. This way, if there is no data available for reading then it will simply return an empty list instead of throwing an error message saying \"No Data Available\".\n```scss\" id=\"spreadsheet\">\n<dx>\n<dy>0</dy>Spreadsheet</spreadsheet>.\n```This code will retrieve data from any given spreadsheet and print it to the console.

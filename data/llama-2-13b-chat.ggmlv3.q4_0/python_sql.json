Here's an example of how you can use SQLite and Python to retrieve all records from a table where the value in the \"age\" field is greater than 32:\n```\nimport sqlite3\n\n# Connect to the database\nconn = sqlite3.connect('mydatabase.db')\n\n# Retrieve all records where age is greater than 32\ncursor = conn.cursor()\ncursor.execute(\"SELECT * FROM mytable WHERE age > 32\")\n\n# Print the results\nfor row in cursor.fetchall():\n    print(row)\n\n# Close the connection\nconn.close()\n```\nThis code will retrieve all records from a table called \"mytable\" where the value in the \"age\" field is greater than 32, and then print the results.\n\nIf you want to filter by multiple conditions, you can use multiple `WHERE` clauses. For example, to retrieve all records where both the \"age\" field is greater than 32 and the \"gender\" field is \"male\", you could use the following code:\n```\ncursor.execute(\"SELECT * FROM mytable WHERE age > 32 AND gender = 'male'\")\n```\nI hope this helps! Let me know if you have any other questions."}, "finish_reason": "stop"}], "usage": {"prompt_tokens": 0, "completion_tokens": 277, "total_tokens": 277}, "time": "34.88"}

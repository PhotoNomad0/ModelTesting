Here is a Python function named `format_number` that takes a number as its only parameter and converts it to a string with commas as a thousands separator:\n```\ndef format_number(num):\n    return f\"{num:,}\"\n```\nHere's an explanation of how the function works:\n\n* The `f` string prefix is used to specify that the following string should be treated as a formatted string.\n* The `{num:,}` syntax tells Python to convert the `num` parameter to a string and add commas as a thousands separator. The `,` character is used as the thousands separator.\n\nHere are some examples of how you can use the `format_number` function:\n```\nprint(format_number(123456))  # Output: \"123,456\"\nprint(format_number(123456789))  # Output: \"123,456,789\"\n```\nI hope this helps! Let me know if you have any questions or need further assistance."}, "finish_reason": "stop"}], "usage": {"prompt_tokens": 0, "completion_tokens": 239, "total_tokens": 239}, "time": "32.09"}

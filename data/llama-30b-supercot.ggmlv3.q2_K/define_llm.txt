One method used in this area, which has gained popularity recently, is the usage of language models (LLM). These are systems that use natural language processing techniques to understand human speech or text input and generate responses accordingly. LLMs have been found to outperform other methods when it comes to generating realistic-sounding sentences. They also enable machines to learn from data in an unsupervised manner, which means they can pick up on patterns and make predictions without explicit guidance. These models are being",

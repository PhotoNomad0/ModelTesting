To solve this problem, we need more information about the number of hours per day that Tom spends washing and drying his socks, as well as the duration of time required for each pair of socks to fully dry. Without these additional pieces of data, it is not possible to determine how long it will take him to dry seven pairs of socks under similar weather conditions.

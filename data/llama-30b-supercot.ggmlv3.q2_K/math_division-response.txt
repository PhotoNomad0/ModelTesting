Emily's breakfast included a bowl full of cereals, which she decided to use as a canvas for her creative designs. She created 9 unique artworks and used a total of 63 pieces of cereals. Each design required an average of approximately **8** pieces of cereal bits (63/9). However, it is not possible to determine if she used the same amount in each creation since we have no further information on her process or intentions.

Cam's typing speed with two hands was 9 words per minute. After breaking his right arm, Cam had to use his left hand only for a while which reduced his typing speed by three words per minute (6 - 9). The difference between the number of words he could type in 5 minutes before and after he broke his arm is therefore: 30 words (5 x [9-6]).

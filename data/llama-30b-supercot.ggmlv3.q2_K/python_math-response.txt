To solve this equation using Cardanoâ€™s method in Python programming language, we will follow these steps: 1. First, rewrite it in terms of base ten numbers instead of powers of two and one. The equation can be rewritten as ax^3+bx^2+c*x+d=0 where a = 1, b = 0, c = 1 and d = -130.
2. Then we will use the addition property to add or subtract terms until there is only one term left in the equation. In this case, ax^3+bx^2+c

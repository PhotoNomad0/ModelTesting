First, rewrite it in terms of base ten numbers instead of powers of two and one. The equation can be rewritten as ax^3+bx^2+c*x+d=0 where a = 1, b = 0, c = 1 and d = -130.\n2. Then we will use the addition property to add or subtract terms until there is only one term left in the equation. In this case, ax^3+bx^2+c", "index": 0, "logprobs": null, "finish_reason": "stop", "references": []}], "usage": {"prompt_tokens": 4096, "completion_tokens": 89, "total_tokens": 125, "thread_count": 4, "prompt_template": "\n### Instruction\nParaphrase the text below by expanding the words based on the subject\n### Human:\n%1\n### Assistant:\n"}, "time": "250.00"}

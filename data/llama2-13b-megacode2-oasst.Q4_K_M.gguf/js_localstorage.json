This method takes two arguments: the key for the item you want to store, and the value of that item. Here's an example:\n\n```javascript\n// Save a string to localStorage\nlocalStorage.setItem('myKey', 'myValue');\n\n// Retrieve a string from localStorage\nconst myValue = localStorage.getItem('myKey');\n```\n\nTo read back data from localStorage, you can use the `localStorage.getItem()` method. This method takes one argument: the key of the item you want to retrieve. Here's an example:\n\n```javascript\n// Retrieve a string from localStorage\nconst myValue = localStorage.getItem('myKey');\n```\n\nTo save an object to localStorage, you can use JSON.stringify() method to convert the object into a string and then use the `localStorage.setItem()` method to store it. Here's an example:\n\n```javascript\n// Save an object to localStorage\nconst myObject = { key1: 'value1', key2: 'value2' };\nlocalStorage.setItem('myKey', JSON.stringify(myObject));\n\n// Retrieve an object from localStorage\nconst myObject = JSON.parse(localStorage.getItem('myKey'));\n```\n\nTo retrieve an object from localStorage, you can use the `JSON.parse()` method to convert the string back into an object. Here's an example:\n\n```javascript\n// Retrieve an object from localStorage\nconst myObject = JSON.parse(localStorage.getItem('myKey'));\n```\n\nNote that the maximum size of data that can be stored in localStorage is 5MB per domain, and the data will be cleared when the browser is closed. If you need to store larger amounts of data, you may want to consider using a database instead."}, "finish_reason": "stop"}], "usage": {"prompt_tokens": 0, "completion_tokens": 396, "total_tokens": 396}, "time": "28.59"}

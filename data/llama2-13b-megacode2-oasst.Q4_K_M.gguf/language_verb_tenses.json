For example: \"I eat breakfast every morning.\"\nPast tense is used to describe actions or states that occurred in the past. For example: \"I ate breakfast this morning.\"\nFuture tense is used to describe actions or states that will happen in the future. For example: \"I will eat breakfast tomorrow morning.\"\n\nIn addition to these three main tenses, there are also perfect tenses (past perfect and present perfect) which are used to describe actions that were completed before another action in the past or present. For example: \"I had eaten breakfast before I went to work.\"\n\nIt's important to note that verb tenses can be complex and can vary depending on the context of a sentence, so it's always a good idea to consult a grammar guide or use a tool like Grammarly to ensure you are using the correct tense."}, "finish_reason": "stop"}], "usage": {"prompt_tokens": 0, "completion_tokens": 214, "total_tokens": 214}, "time": "14.83"}

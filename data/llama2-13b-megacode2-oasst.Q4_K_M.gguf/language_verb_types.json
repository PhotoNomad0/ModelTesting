They show what the subject of a sentence is doing or experiencing. Examples include run, jump, think, and feel.\n\nLinking verbs connect the subject of a sentence to a descriptive word or phrase. They do not express an action or state of being directly but rather link the subject to additional information about it. Examples include am, is, are, was, were, be, become, and seem.\n\nHelping verbs support the main verb in a sentence by providing additional information about when, where, why, how, or under what conditions an action occurs. They do not express an action or state of being directly but rather help to convey the meaning of the main verb. Examples include have, has, had, do, does, did, can, could, shall, should, will, would, may, might, must, and shall.\n\nIt's important to note that some verbs can function as more than one type of verb depending on their context. For example, the verb \"be\" can be both a linking verb (e.g., I am happy) and a helping verb (e.g., She will be there soon)."}, "finish_reason": "stop"}], "usage": {"prompt_tokens": 0, "completion_tokens": 275, "total_tokens": 275}, "time": "18.80"}

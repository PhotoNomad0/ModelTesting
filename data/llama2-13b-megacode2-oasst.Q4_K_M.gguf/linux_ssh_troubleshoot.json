Here are some possible reasons and solutions:\n\n1. The public key is not added to the authorized_keys file on the remote server: To resolve this, you need to add the public key to the authorized_keys file on the remote server. You can do this by following these steps:\n\n   a. Copy your public key to the clipboard.\n   b. Log in to the remote server as the user with permission to edit the authorized_keys file (usually root or the owner of the user account).\n   c. Open the authorized_keys file using a text editor (e.g., nano, vi, or vim).\n   d. Paste your public key into the file, one line per key.\n   e. Save and close the file.\n\n2. The permissions on the public key file are incorrect: Make sure that the permissions on the public key file (e.g., ~/UserKey.pem) allow the remote server to read it. You can check the permissions using the ls -l command and adjust them as needed with chmod.\n\n3. The SSH daemon is not configured to use public keys: Check if the SSH daemon on the remote server is configured to accept public key connections. You can do this by checking the /etc/ssh/sshd_config file and ensuring that the \"PermitRootLogin without-password\" option is set to \"yes\" (or \"AllowUsers <username>\" for specific users).\n\n4. The remote server's firewall or security group rules are blocking SSH traffic: Check if there are any firewall or security group rules on the remote server that are blocking SSH traffic. You can check this by running the following command on the remote server:\n\n   sudo ufw status\n\n   If there are any blocked rules, you can allow SSH traffic by running the following commands:\n\n   sudo ufw allow ssh/tcp\n   sudo ufw enable\n\n5. The remote server's key fingerprint does not match the expected value: Sometimes, the remote server's key fingerprint may have changed, and your local client is trying to connect with an outdated fingerprint. To resolve this, you can update your local client's known_hosts file by running the following command:\n\n   ssh-keygen -R <remote_server_ip_address>\n\n   This will regenerate the known_hosts file and add the new key fingerprint.\n\nIf none of these solutions resolve the issue, you may need to contact the remote server's administrator for further assistance."}, "finish_reason": "stop"}], "usage": {"prompt_tokens": 0, "completion_tokens": 560, "total_tokens": 560}, "time": "39.94"}

We can test both possibilities by substituting them into the original equation:\n\nIf 8^x = 0, then 2^x = 130/8 = 16.5, which is not an integer value for x. Therefore, this solution does not work.\n\nIf 2^x = 0, then 8^x = 130/2 = 65, which is not an integer value for x. Therefore, this solution also does not work.\n\nSince neither of these solutions works, we can conclude that there are no integers values for x that satisfy the equation 8^x + 2^x = 130.\n\nTherefore, the equation has no real solutions.\n"}, "finish_reason": "stop"}], "usage": {"prompt_tokens": 0, "completion_tokens": 322, "total_tokens": 322}, "time": "21.61"}

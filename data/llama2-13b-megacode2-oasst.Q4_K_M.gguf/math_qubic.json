Calculate the discriminant D = b^2 - 3ac. If D > 0, then there are two real and distinct roots. If D = 0, then there is one real root. If D < 0, then there are two complex conjugate roots.\n\n2. In this case, a = 1, b = 0, c = 1, and d = -130, so we have:\n\nD = (0)^2 - 3(1)(1) = -19\n\nSince D < 0, there are two complex conjugate roots.\n\n3. Use Cardano's formula to find the roots:\n\nx = (-b \u00b1 sqrt(D)) / (3a)\n\nx = (-0 \u00b1 sqrt(-19)) / (3(1))\n\nx = (-0 \u00b1 i*sqrt(2)) / 3\n\nwhere i is the imaginary unit.\n\n4. Since we are dealing with complex numbers, we need to use Euler's formula e^i\u03b8 = cos(\u03b8) + i*sin(\u03b8) to express x in terms of real and imaginary parts:\n\nx1 = (-0 \u00b1 i*sqrt(2)) / 3\nx1 = (0 \u00b1 sqrt(2)/3)*(1/2 + i*sqrt(3)/6)\nx1 = (0 \u00b1 (1/2 + i*sqrt(3)/6))\n\nx2 = (-0 \u00b1 i*sqrt(2)) / 3\nx2 = (0 \u00b1 sqrt(2)/3)*(1/2 - i*sqrt(3)/6)\nx2 = (0 \u00b1 (1/2 - i*sqrt(3)/6))\n\nTherefore, the roots of the equation ax^3 + bx^2 + cx + d = 0 with a = 1, b = 0, c = 1, and d = -130 are:\n\nx1 = (0 \u00b1 (1/2 + i*sqrt(3)/6))\nx2 = (0 \u00b1 (1/2 - i*sqrt(3)/6))\n\nThese roots are complex numbers.\n\n"}, "finish_reason": "stop"}], "usage": {"prompt_tokens": 0, "completion_tokens": 535, "total_tokens": 535}, "time": "37.42"}

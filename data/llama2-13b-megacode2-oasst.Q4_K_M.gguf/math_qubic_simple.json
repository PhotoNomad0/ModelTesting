Cardano's formula is a method used to solve cubic equations of the form ax^3 + bx^2 + cx + d = 0. Here's how we can use it to find the value of x in your equation:\n\nFirst, let's rewrite your equation as:\n\nx^3 - 130 = 0\n\nNow, we need to find the discriminant D of the equation:\n\nD = b^2 - 3ac\nD = 4 - 9 * 1 * 1\nD = -5\n\nSince D is negative, this means that the equation has three real roots. We can use Cardano's formula to find these roots:\n\nx = (-b \u00b1 \u221a(D)) / (3a)\n\nIn our case, a = 1, b = 0, and c = -130. So we have:\n\nx = (-0 \u00b1 \u221a(-5)) / (3 * 1)\nx = (-0 \u00b1 2) / 3\n\nSince any number multiplied by zero is still zero, we can ignore the first term in the equation and get:\n\nx = 2/3\n\nTherefore, the value of x that satisfies your equation is x = 2/3.\n\nI hope this helps!

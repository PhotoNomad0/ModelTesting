It first checks if the input list is empty and returns None if it is. Otherwise, it calculates the sum of all the numbers in the list and divides by the number of elements to get the mean. It then calculates the variance by summing the squared differences between each number and the mean, dividing by the number of elements, and taking the square root to get the standard deviation.\n\nHere's an example usage of the function:\n```python\nnumbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]\nmean, std_dev = calculate_stats(numbers)\nprint(\"Mean:\", mean)\nprint(\"Standard Deviation:\", std_dev)\n```\nThis will output:\n```\nMean: 3.0\nStandard Deviation: 1.224746589492706\n```\nNote that this function assumes that the input list contains only numeric values. If the input list may contain non-numeric values, you may want to add additional error handling or type checking to the function.

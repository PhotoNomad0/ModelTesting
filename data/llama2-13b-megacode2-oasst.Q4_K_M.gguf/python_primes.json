It does this by checking whether `n` is less than or equal to 1, in which case it returns `False`. Otherwise, it loops through all the integers from 2 up to the square root of `n`, and checks whether any of them divide evenly into `n`. If it finds one that does, it returns `False`. If it doesn't find any that do, it returns `True`.\nThe main part of the program initializes a counter `count` to 0 and a variable `num` to 2. It then enters a while loop that continues as long as `count` is less than 100. Inside the loop, it checks whether `num` is prime using the `is_prime` function. If it is, it prints it out and increments `count` by 1. Finally, it increments `num` by 1 and continues the loop.\nI hope this helps! Let me know if you have any questions."}, "finish_reason": "stop"}], "usage": {"prompt_tokens": 0, "completion_tokens": 369, "total_tokens": 369}, "time": "25.08"}

You can use this function to read data from any Excel file on your computer by passing the file path as an argument. For example:\n```python\ndf = read_excel('path/to/my/file.xlsx')\nprint(df)\n```\nThis will print the contents of the Excel spreadsheet in a Pandas DataFrame format.\nNote that you'll need to have pandas installed on your system in order to use this function.

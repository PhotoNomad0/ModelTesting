You can modify this function to read data from different sheets or columns by changing the code inside the for loop.\nTo use this function, you'll need to install the openpyxl library using pip:\n```bash\npip install openpyxl\n```\nThen you can call the function like this:\n```python\ndata = read_spreadsheet('path/to/spreadsheet.xlsx')\nprint(data)\n```\nThis will print a list of dictionaries containing the data from the first sheet in the spreadsheet.\nLet me know if you have any questions or need further assistance!"}, "finish_reason": "stop"}], "usage": {"prompt_tokens": 0, "completion_tokens": 292, "total_tokens": 292}, "time": "21.37"}

It first checks if the filename matches the required format using the `re.match()` function. If the filename does not match the format, it returns `None`. Otherwise, it uses the `re.search()` function to find a match for the three-character code pattern in the filename. If a match is found, it returns the matched string; otherwise, it returns `None`.\n\nThe function also catches any exceptions that may occur during the regular expression matching or extraction process and prints an error message. In case of an exception, it still returns `None` to indicate that the code extraction failed.\n\nHere's an example usage of the function:\n```python\nfilename = \"57-1Jn.usfm\"\ncode = extract_code(filename)\nprint(\"Code:\", code)  # Output: 1Jn\n```\nIn this example, the function successfully extracts the three-character code \"1Jn\" from the filename \"57-1Jn.usfm\" and prints it. If the filename was \"57-abc.usfm\", the function would return `None` since the code does not match the required format.\n\nNote that this function assumes that the filename extension is always \".usfm\". If you want to handle other extensions as well, you can modify the regular expression pattern accordingly.

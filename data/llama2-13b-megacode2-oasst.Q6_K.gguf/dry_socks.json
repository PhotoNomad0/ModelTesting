Therefore, we can calculate the time it would take to dry 7 pairs of socks by dividing the total time (10 hours) by the number of pairs (10 pairs).\n\nTime = Total Time / Number of Pairs\nTime = 10 hours / 10 pairs\nTime = 1 hour per pair\n\nSo, it will take Tom 1 hour to dry seven pairs of socks under the same weather conditions. However, this is just an estimate and the actual time may vary depending on factors such as the temperature, humidity, and wind speed. It's also worth noting that air drying socks can take longer than using a dryer, especially if the weather is cool or damp. In general, it's best to check on the socks periodically and remove them from the line when they are dry to prevent them from getting over-dried or mildewed.

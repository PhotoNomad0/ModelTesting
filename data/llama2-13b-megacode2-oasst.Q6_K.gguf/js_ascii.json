The .toString(16) method is used to convert each number to its hexadecimal representation.\nWhen you run this program in a JavaScript environment such as a web browser's developer console, it will output the following:\n```\nASCII code: 0, Hexadecimal code: 0\nASCII code: 1, Hexadecimal code: 1\nASCII code: 2, Hexadecimal code: 2\n...\nASCII code: 7F, Hexadecimal code: 7F\n```\nI hope this helps!

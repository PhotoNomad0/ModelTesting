This method takes two arguments: the key of the item you want to store and the value of that item. Here's an example:\n\n```javascript\n// Save a string to localStorage\nlocalStorage.setItem('myKey', 'myValue');\n\n// Retrieve a string from localStorage\nconst myValue = localStorage.getItem('myKey');\n```\n\nTo read data back from localStorage, you can use the `localStorage.getItem()` method. This method takes one argument: the key of the item you want to retrieve. Here's an example:\n\n```javascript\n// Retrieve a string from localStorage\nconst myValue = localStorage.getItem('myKey');\n```\n\nTo remove an item from localStorage, you can use the `localStorage.removeItem()` method. This method takes one argument: the key of the item you want to remove. Here's an example:\n\n```javascript\n// Remove an item from localStorage\nlocalStorage.removeItem('myKey');\n```\n\nNote that localStorage is a browser-specific storage mechanism, so it's not available in all environments. However, it's widely supported and can be used to store data across page refreshes and sessions.

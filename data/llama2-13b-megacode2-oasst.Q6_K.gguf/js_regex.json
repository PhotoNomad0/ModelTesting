The parentheses around the matched group capture the code as a separate value, which is then returned by the function.\nTo use this function, you can pass in a filename as a string argument:\n```javascript\nconst filename = \"57-1Jn.usfm\";\nconst code = extractCode(filename);\nconsole.log(code); // Output: \"1Jn\"\n```\nThis will extract the three-character code from the filename and store it in the `code` variable, which you can then use as needed. Note that this function assumes that the filename extension is always \".usfm\", so you may need to modify it if your filenames have a different extension format.

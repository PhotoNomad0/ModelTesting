Each tense conveys a different time frame for the action of the verb.\n\nPast tense verbs describe actions that have already occurred in the past. They are formed by adding \"-ed\" or \"-d\" to the base form of the verb. For example: \"I walked,\" \"She played,\" \"They had eaten.\"\n\nPresent tense verbs describe actions that are happening right now or regularly occur in the present. They are formed by using the base form of the verb. For example: \"I walk,\" \"She plays,\" \"They eat.\"\n\nFuture tense verbs describe actions that will happen in the future. They are formed by adding \"will\" before the base form of the verb or using the present simple form with \"going to.\" For example: \"I will walk,\" \"She is going to play,\" \"They are going to eat.\"\n\nIn addition to these three main tenses, there are also perfect tenses (past perfect and present perfect) and progressive tenses (present continuous and past continuous), which provide more specific information about the timing of the action.\n\nI hope this helps!

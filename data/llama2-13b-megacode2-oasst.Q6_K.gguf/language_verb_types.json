They express what the subject of a sentence is doing or experiencing. Examples include run, jump, think, and feel.\n\nLinking verbs connect the subject of a sentence to additional information about that subject. They do not describe an action but rather provide a link between the subject and its description. Examples include am, is, are, was, were, be, become, and seem.\n\nHelping verbs assist the main verb in a sentence by providing additional information about when, where, why, or how an action occurs. They do not describe an action themselves but rather help to convey the tense, mood, or voice of the main verb. Examples include have, has, had, do, does, did, can, could, shall, should, will, would, may, might, must, and ought to.\n\nIt's important to note that some verbs can function as more than one type of verb depending on the context in which they are used. For example, \"be\" can be a linking verb (e.g., \"The cat is black.\") or a helping verb (e.g., \"I am happy.\")."}, "finish_reason": "stop"}], "usage": {"prompt_tokens": 0, "completion_tokens": 274, "total_tokens": 274}, "time": "30.38"}

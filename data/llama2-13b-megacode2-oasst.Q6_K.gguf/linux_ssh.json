Here's a breakdown of the options used in the command:\n\n-i \"~/UserKey.pem\": This option specifies the path to your private key file, which will be used for authentication on the remote server. The ~/UserKey.pem file should contain your public and private keys.\n\n-C: This option enables compression of data sent over the SSH connection, which can improve performance and reduce bandwidth usage.\n\n-L 25900:localhost:5900: This option creates a local port forwarding tunnel from the remote server to your local machine on port 25900. The remote host is localhost (127.0.0.1) and the destination port is 5900.\n\nuser@ec2-34-221-131-108.us-west-2.compute.amazonaws.com: This option specifies the remote host to connect to, which is an Amazon EC2 instance with the IP address 34.221.131.108 in the US West (Oregon) region.\n\nOverall, this command establishes a secure connection to the remote server and sets up a port forwarding tunnel from the remote server to your local machine on port 5900. You can use this tunnel to access services running on your local machine from the remote server. Note that you will need to have the necessary permissions and access to the remote server in order to run this command successfully.\n\nIf you have any further questions or concerns, please let me know!"}, "finish_reason": "stop"}], "usage": {"prompt_tokens": 0, "completion_tokens": 357, "total_tokens": 357}, "time": "40.94"}

There could be several reasons for this, such as:\n\n1. The public key has not been added to the authorized_keys file on the remote server. You can add the public key by copying it to the ~/.ssh/authorized_keys file on the remote server and then running the chmod 600 ~/.ssh/authorized_keys command to set the permissions.\n2. The public key has expired or has been revoked. You can check the validity of the public key by running the ssh-keygen -l command. If the key is expired or revoked, you will need to generate a new key pair and add the new public key to the authorized_keys file on the remote server.\n3. The permissions on the private key file are incorrect. You should ensure that the ~/.ssh/UserKey.pem file has read, write, and execute permissions for the owner (i.e., chmod 600 ~/.ssh/UserKey.pem).\n4. There is a problem with the format of the public key or the private key file. You can try generating a new key pair using ssh-keygen and then adding the new public key to the authorized_keys file on the remote server.\n\nIf you have tried all of these steps and are still encountering the same error, it is possible that there is an issue with the remote server's SSH configuration or with your network setup. In this case, you may need to contact your system administrator for further assistance."}, "finish_reason": "stop"}], "usage": {"prompt_tokens": 0, "completion_tokens": 349, "total_tokens": 349}, "time": "38.87"}

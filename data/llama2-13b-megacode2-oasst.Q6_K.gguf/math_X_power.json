In this case, we have 8^x and 2^x. Adding them together gives us (8 + 2)^x = 130, which simplifies to 10^x = 130.\n\nNext, we need to isolate x on one side of the equation. To do this, we can divide both sides by 10:\n\nx = 130 / 10\n\nFinally, we can simplify the fraction to get the value of x:\n\nx = 13\n\nSo the solution for the equation 8^x + 2^x = 130 is x = 13."}, "finish_reason": "stop"}], "usage": {"prompt_tokens": 0, "completion_tokens": 170, "total_tokens": 170}, "time": "19.02"}

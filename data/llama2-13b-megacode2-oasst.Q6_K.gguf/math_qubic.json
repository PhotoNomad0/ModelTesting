Cardano's formula is used to find the roots of a quadratic equation. In this case, we have:\n\nax^3 + bx^2 + cx + d = 0\na = 1\nb = 0\nc = 1\nd = -130\n\nUsing Cardano's formula, we can find the value of x where the equation is equal to zero. Here are the steps:\n\nStep 1: Calculate discriminant\nFirst, we need to calculate the discriminant (D) of the quadratic equation:\n\nD = b^2 - 3ac\nD = 0^2 - 3(1)(1)\nD = -9\n\nSince D is negative, there are two real roots for the equation.\n\nStep 2: Use Cardano's formula\nCardano's formula states that:\n\nx = (-b \u00b1 \u221a(D)) / (3a)\n\nIn our case, we have:\n\n-b = 0\n\u221a(D) = \u00b1\u221a(-9)\n\nSince the square root of a negative number is not defined in real numbers, we need to use complex numbers. We can represent the roots as:\n\nx1 = (-b \u00b1 i\u221a(D)) / (3a)\nx1 = (0 \u00b1 i\u221a(-9)) / (3(1))\nx1 = (0 \u00b1 i\u221a3i) / 3\n\nStep 3: Simplify the result\nNow, we can simplify the expression for x1:\n\nx1 = (0 \u00b1 i\u221a3i) / 3\nx1 = (0 \u00b1 i\u221a3) / 3\n\nSince i^2 = -1, we can rewrite the expression as:\n\nx1 = (0 \u00b1 i\u221a3) / 3\nx1 = (0 \u00b1 (-1/2 + i\u221a3)/3\nx1 = (0 \u00b1 (-1/2 + i\u221a3)/3\n\nTherefore, the value of x where the equation is equal to zero is:\n\nx = (0 \u00b1 (-1/2 + i\u221a3) / 3\n\nIn conclusion, using Cardano's formula, we found that there are two complex roots for the given quadratic equation. One root is real and negative, while the other root is a complex number with a real part of zero and an imaginary part of (1/2 + i\u221a3)."}, "finish_reason": "stop"}], "usage": {"prompt_tokens": 0, "completion_tokens": 496, "total_tokens": 496}, "time": "55.37"}

Add 130 to both sides of the equation to isolate the term with x on one side:\nx^3 + x + 130 = 0 + 130\n\n2. Factor out x from the left-hand side:\nx(x^2 + x + 130) = 130\n\n3. Divide both sides by x to solve for x:\nx^2 + x + 130 = 130 / x\n\n4. Combine like terms on the left-hand side:\n(x^2 + x + 130) - (x^2 + x + 130) = 130 / x - 130 / x\n0 = 0\n\n5.

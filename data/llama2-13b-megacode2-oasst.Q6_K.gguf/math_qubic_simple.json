Cardano's formula is a method used to solve cubic equations of the form ax^3 + bx^2 + cx + d = 0. Here's how we can use it to find the value of x in your equation:\n\nFirst, we need to put the equation in the form ax^3 + bx^2 + cx + d = 0. In this case, a = 1, b = 1, c = -130, and d = 0. So our equation is x^3 + x - 130 = 0.\n\nNext, we need to find the discriminant of the equation. The discriminant is given by:\n\nD = b^2 - 3ac\n\nIn this case, b = 1 and c = -130, so D = 1^2 - 3(1)(-130) = 1 - 393 = -392.\n\nSince the discriminant is negative, we know that there are three real solutions for x. We can use Cardano's formula to find these solutions:\n\nx = (-b \u00b1 \u221aD)/(3a)\n\nIn this case, b = 1 and D = -392, so we have:\n\nx = (-1 \u00b1 \u221a(-392))/3\n\nNow, let's calculate the square roots of -392:\n\n\u221a(-392) = \u221a(392 * i) = \u221a64 * i, where i is the imaginary unit (i^2 = -1)\n\nSo we have:\n\nx = (-1 \u00b1 \u221a64 * i)/3\n\nNow, let's simplify this expression by dividing both sides by 3:\n\nx = (-1/3 \u00b1 \u221a64 * i)/3\n\nSimplifying further gives us:\n\nx = (-1/3 \u00b1 \u221a64 * i)\n\nFinally, we can see that the two solutions for x are complex numbers. In this case, one of the solutions is real and the other two are complex conjugates of each other. To find the real solution, we need to set one of the imaginary terms equal to zero:\n\nx = (-1/3 \u00b1 \u221a64 * i) \u2192 x = (-1/3 \u00b1 (\u221a64 * i))/2 + (\u221a64 * i)/2i\n\nSetting the imaginary term equal to zero, we get:\n\n(\u221a64 * i)/2 = -1/3\n\nDividing both sides by \u221a64, we get:\n\ni/2 = -1/3\n\nMultiplying both sides by 3, we get:\n\ni = -1\n\nSo the real solution for x is:\n\nx = (-1/3 + i)/2 = (-1/3 - i)/2 = (-1/3 - (-i))/2 = (1/3 + i)/2\n\nTherefore, the solutions for x in the equation x^3 + x - 130 = 0 are:\n\nx = (1/3 + i)/2 and x = (1/3 - i)/2\n\nNote that i is the imaginary unit, which satisfies i^2 = -1. These solutions are complex numbers, but one of them (x = (1/3 + i)/2) is a real number. The other solution (x = (1/3 - i)/2) is its complex conjugate, which is also a real number.\n\nI hope this helps! Let me know if you have any further questions.

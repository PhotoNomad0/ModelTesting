Let x be the number of test tubes required for one of the other two experiments. Then the total number of test tubes required for all three experiments is 8 + 2x. The first experiment requires 2 test tubes, so the remaining test tubes are needed for the other two experiments, which together require x test tubes. Therefore, we can write the equation:\n\n2 + 2x = 8 + 2x\n\nSimplifying this equation gives us:\n\n2x = 6\n\nDividing both sides by 2 gives us:\n\nx = 3\n\nSo each of the other two experiments required 3 test tubes."}, "finish_reason": "stop"}], "usage": {"prompt_tokens": 0, "completion_tokens": 143, "total_tokens": 143}, "time": "17.26"}

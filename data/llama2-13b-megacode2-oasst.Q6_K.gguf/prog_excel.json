The SUBSTITUTE function replaces all occurrences of the single quote character (\"'\") with an empty string (\"\"). This will remove any single quotes from the text in the target cell.\n\nNote: If there are other characters you want to replace, you can modify the formula accordingly by specifying the desired replacement string in place of the empty string (\"\"). For example, if you also want to remove double quotes, you could use the following formula:\n\n=SUBSTITUTE(A2,\"'\",\"\")&SUBSTITUTE(A2,\"\\\"\",\"\")\n\nReplace \"\\\"\" with the escape sequence for a double quote character. This will replace any double quotes in the text with an empty string as well."}, "finish_reason": "stop"}], "usage": {"prompt_tokens": 0, "completion_tokens": 201, "total_tokens": 201}, "time": "22.34"}

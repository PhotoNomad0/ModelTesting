This ensures that we are only matching the three character code and not any other part of the filename.\n- `[a-zA-Z0-9]{3}` matches exactly three alphanumeric characters (either uppercase or lowercase letters, or digits).\n- `(?=\\.\\w+$)` is a positive lookahead that matches a dot followed by one or more word characters (letters, digits, or underscores) at the end of the filename. This ensures that we are only matching filenames with the \".usfm\" extension.\n\nSo the regex expression will match \"1Jn\" from the example filename \"57-1Jn.usfm\"."}, "finish_reason": "stop"}], "usage": {"prompt_tokens": 0, "completion_tokens": 238, "total_tokens": 238}, "time": "25.36"}

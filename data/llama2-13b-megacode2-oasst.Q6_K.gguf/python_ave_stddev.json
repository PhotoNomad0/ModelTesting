The function uses the built-in `sum` and `math` modules to perform the calculations.\nIn the example usage, we create a list of numbers `[1, 2, 3, 4, 5]` and call the `calculate_statistics` function with this list. The mean and standard deviation are then printed to the console.\nI hope this helps! Let me know if you have any further questions."}, "finish_reason": "stop"}], "usage": {"prompt_tokens": 0, "completion_tokens": 260, "total_tokens": 260}, "time": "28.46"}

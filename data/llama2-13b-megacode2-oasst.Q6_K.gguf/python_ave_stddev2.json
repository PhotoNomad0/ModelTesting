Here's an example of a Python function that calculates the average and standard deviation of a list of numbers:\n```python\nimport math\n\ndef calculate_stats(numbers):\n    if len(numbers) == 0:\n        return None, None\n    \n    total = sum(numbers)\n    average = total / len(numbers)\n    \n    variance = sum((x - average) ** 2 for x in numbers) / len(numbers)\n    standard_deviation = math.sqrt(variance)\n    \n    return average, standard_deviation\n```\nThis function takes a list of numbers as input and returns the average and standard deviation of those numbers. It first checks if the list is empty and returns None if it is. Then, it calculates the sum of all the numbers in the list and divides by the length of the list to get the average. Next, it calculates the variance by summing the squared differences between each number and the average, and then dividing by the length of the list. Finally, it takes the square root of the variance to get the standard deviation.\n\nHere's an example of how you can use this function:\n```python\nnumbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]\naverage, std_dev = calculate_stats(numbers)\nprint(\"Average:\", average)\nprint(\"Standard Deviation:\", std_dev)\n```\nThis will output:\n```\nAverage: 3.0\nStandard Deviation: 1.4142135623730951\n```\nI hope this helps!

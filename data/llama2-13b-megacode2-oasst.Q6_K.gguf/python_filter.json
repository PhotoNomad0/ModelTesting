The resulting filtered list is returned.\nYou can use this function like this:\n```python\nstrings = [\"hello\", \"\", \"world\", \"\", \"foo\"]\nfiltered_strings = filter_empty_strings(strings)\nprint(filtered_strings)  # Output: ['hello', 'world', 'foo']\n```\nIn this example, the `filter_empty_strings` function is called with a list of strings, and the resulting filtered list is printed. The empty strings `\"\"` are filtered out, leaving only the non-empty strings in the output.\nNote that this function assumes that the input list contains only strings (i.e., it doesn't handle other types). If you need to handle other types as well, you can use a more general approach like using the `isinstance` function to check the type of each element before filtering.

For each number, it checks if it's greater than 1 and not divisible by any number from 2 up to its square root. If the number passes these tests, it checks if it's one more than a square number. If it is, the program prints out the number and breaks out of the loop.\n\nNote that this solution assumes that the input numbers are integers. If you're working with floating-point numbers or other types of numbers, you may need to adjust the code accordingly. Additionally, there may be more efficient ways to solve this problem depending on the specific requirements of your application. However, this solution should work for most cases.

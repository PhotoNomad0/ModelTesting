You can call this function by passing the path to your Excel file as an argument, like this:\n```python\ndata = read_excel('path/to/your/file.xlsx')\nprint(data)\n```\nThis will print the data from the first sheet in the Excel file. Note that you'll need to have openpyxl installed on your system in order to use this function. You can install it using pip:\n```bash\npip install openpyxl\n```\nI hope this helps! Let me know if you have any questions."}, "finish_reason": "stop"}], "usage": {"prompt_tokens": 0, "completion_tokens": 364, "total_tokens": 364}, "time": "41.00"}

You can use this function to read data from any spreadsheet that is saved as a CSV file.\n\nHere's an example of how you can use this function:\n\n```python\nspreadsheet_file = 'path/to/your/spreadsheet.csv'\ndataframe = read_spreadsheet(spreadsheet_file)\nprint(dataframe.head())\n```\nThis will print the first few rows of data from your spreadsheet to the console. You can access any column in the DataFrame using its index, for example:\n\n```python\ncolumn1 = dataframe['Column 1']\nprint(column1[0]) # prints the value in the first row of Column 1\n```\nI hope this helps! Let me know if you have any further questions."}, "finish_reason": "stop"}], "usage": {"prompt_tokens": 0, "completion_tokens": 234, "total_tokens": 234}, "time": "26.07"}

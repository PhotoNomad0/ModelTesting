Here is how their usage varies across different areas:\n\n1. Natural Language Processing (NLP): LLM's form the backbone of many NLP applications like machine translation, sentiment analysis, text summarization, chatbots etc. They learn from vast amounts of data to understand context and generate coherent human-like text or responses.\n\n2. Dialogue Systems: LLMs are used in developing dialogue systems that can carry out natural conversations with users. By learning patterns in conversations, they can respond appropriately to user inputs.\n\n3. Machine Generation: LLM's have found use in generating machine content like reports, articles, or even code. They help in automating the process of creating structured data and reducing manual efforts.\n\n4. Chatbots: With the aid of deep learning algorithms and LLMs, chatbots can understand user queries, respond appropriately, learn from their mistakes, and improve with each interaction. \n\n5. Seq2seq Models: LLM's are used in sequential models (like machine translation) where understanding context is crucial to generate correct output.\n\n6. Research and Exploration: LLM's provide a powerful tool for AI researchers to push the boundaries of what is possible with language understanding and generation, enabling new explorations in AI. \n\nIn summary, LLMs are used widely in AI research because they enable machines to understand, generate, and interact with human language in ways that were not possible before."}, "finish_reason": "stop"}], "usage": {"prompt_tokens": 0, "completion_tokens": 342, "total_tokens": 342}, "time": "18.29"}

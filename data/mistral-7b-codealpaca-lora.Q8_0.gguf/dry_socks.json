Therefore, if one cycle of drying (washing and hanging to dry) takes 10 hours for 10 pairs, then it would still take 10 hours to dry seven pairs assuming the same washer, weather conditions, and methodology are used. This is due to parallelism in time, meaning all socks dry at the same time regardless of the total number of socks being washed. So he would hang seven pairs of socks outside and come back inside 10 hours later with dry socks."}, "finish_reason": "stop"}], "usage": {"prompt_tokens": 0, "completion_tokens": 126, "total_tokens": 126}, "time": "7.53"}

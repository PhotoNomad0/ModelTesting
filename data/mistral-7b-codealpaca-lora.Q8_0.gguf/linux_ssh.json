Here's what each part of the command does:\n\n- `ssh`: Invokes the OpenSSH 'Secure Shell' command for managing and initiating an SSH connections.\n  \n- `-i \"~/UserKey.pem\"`: Specifies the private key to use for decrypting the data during the SSH connection. The ~ character represents the home directory, so it means \"use the file in my home directory called UserKey.pem\".\n \n- `-C`: Disables X11 forwarding by default. X11 is a protocol that allows applications to display their GUI on remote machines.\n  \n- `-L`: Option used for redirection of a local port to a remote hosted service. In this case, it's redirecting port 25900 on the local machine to port 5900 on the remote server.\n  \n- `25900:localhost:5900`: This portion specifies that on the local machine (where you are running the SSH command), port 25900, will connect to the remote server where it will connect to port 5900 there.\n  \n- `user@ec2-34-221-131-108.us-west-2.compute.amazonaws.com`: Specifies the user (who must exist on the remote server) you want to log in as on the remote machine."}, "finish_reason": "stop"}], "usage": {"prompt_tokens": 0, "completion_tokens": 343, "total_tokens": 343}, "time": "54.19"}

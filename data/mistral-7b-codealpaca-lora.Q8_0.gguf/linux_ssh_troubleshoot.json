This can happen for a number of reasons:\n\n1. Your public key has not been correctly added to your EC2 instance. \n    - Go to Key Pairs on the AWS Management Console, find the key pair associated with your EC2 instance and add your public key there.\n\n2. The SSH client is not able to find your private key at the location you've specified (-i \"~/UserKey.pem\"). \n    - Make sure that the path to your private key is correct. The tilde (~) symbol should be replaced with the actual absolute path to your private key.\n\n3. Your instance denies connections from your IP address due to its security group settings or rules.\n   - Check if your IP address or range is included in the security group rules of your EC2 instance. If not, add it. \n\n4. The SSH client and the server are using different protocol versions.\n    - This can cause a problem when trying to connect via SSH. By default, the SSH client uses version 2, while some servers only accept version 1. To resolve this issue, you may need to update your SSH client or specify the correct protocol version manually in your command."}, "finish_reason": "stop"}], "usage": {"prompt_tokens": 0, "completion_tokens": 288, "total_tokens": 288}, "time": "21.23"}

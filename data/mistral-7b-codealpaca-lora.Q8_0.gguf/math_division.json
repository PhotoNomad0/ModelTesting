So, 63 cereal bits divided by 9 designs gives us 7 cereal bits per design. This suggests that she may not have used an equal number of cereal bits in each design as there are 2 designs left without any cereal bits (i.e., some designs had more than others).\n\nHere is the Python code to calculate it:\n\n```python\ntotal_cereal_bits = 63\ntotal_designs = 9\n\ncereal_bits_per_design = total_cereal_bits / total_designs\nprint(f\"Cereal bits per design: {cereal_bits_per_design}\")\n```\n\nRunning this code would give you: `Cereal bits per design: 7`."}, "finish_reason": "stop"}], "usage": {"prompt_tokens": 0, "completion_tokens": 194, "total_tokens": 194}, "time": "11.40"}

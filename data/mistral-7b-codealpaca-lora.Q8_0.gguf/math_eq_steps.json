So, 4 times 2 equals 8.\n\nThen, substitute this back into the original equation: 25 - 8 + 3.\n\nNext, do the subtraction and addition from left to right starting from the first digit on each operation. Adding 25 and 3 gives 28, and then subtracting 8 provides a final answer of 20.\n\nSo, the solution is 20."}, "finish_reason": "stop"}], "usage": {"prompt_tokens": 0, "completion_tokens": 195, "total_tokens": 195}, "time": "11.37"}

The theorem states that if all coefficients of a polynomial are integers and its leading coefficient is positive, then at least one of the roots is a rational number. \n\nHere's how you would do it:\n\n```python\nimport numpy as np\n\n# Define the coefficients of the cubic equation\ncoefficients = [-130, -1, 1]\n\n# Check all possible rational root values\nfor root in [n/m for n in range(1, 12) for m in range(1, 4)]: # We know x is between -4 and 4 so we can limit the range of 'root' accordingly.\n    if np.gcd(np.polyval(coefficients, root), 130) == 1: # If the gcd of the value of the polynomial at the root and 130 is 1, then that is a rational root.\n        x = root\n        break\nprint(\"The roots is : \",x)\n```\nThis code checks all possible rational values for 'x' by testing numbers in range from 1 to 11 (since cubic equations can have multiple roots). It uses the numpy gcd function to calculate greatest common divisor and polyval method to evaluate a polynomial at given point. When it finds a root where the value of the polynomial equals 130, it breaks the loop and prints out that root.\n\nPlease note that this code may take some time to run because cubic equations can have multiple roots and checking all possible rational values takes some time. In real scenarios, you would probably use a numerical method like Newton's method or bisection method to find the roots of a cubic equation."}, "finish_reason": "stop"}], "usage": {"prompt_tokens": 0, "completion_tokens": 382, "total_tokens": 382}, "time": "21.54"}

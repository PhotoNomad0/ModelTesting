For this particular equation, `a=1`,`b=-1` and `c=-130`.\n\nFirstly, we need to group all terms on one side of the equal sign: \n\n1.`axx = b\u00b2/3a + c/a` (identical to `x\u00b2 = (-b \u00b1 sqrt(b\u00b2 - 4ac)) / (2a)`)\n\nSecondly, we find two values for x by solving this equation twice, which is equivalent to finding two solutions of the quadratic equation:\n```\nx = [-b +/- sqrt(b\u00b2 - 4ac)] / (2a)\n```\nIn our case, `a=1`, `b=-1` and `c=-130`. So we get:\n\n```python\nimport cmath # used for complex number computation\n\n# define constants\na = 1\nb = -1\nc = -130\n\n# calculate the discriminant\nD = (b**2) - (4*a*c)\n\n# find two solutions\nsol1 = (-b + cmath.sqrt(D))/(2 * a)\nsol2 = (-b - cmath.sqrt(D))/(2 * a)\n\nprint(\"The solutions are {0} and {1}\".format(sol1, sol2))\n```\nPlease note that the `cmath` module in Python is used for complex number computation. Since cubic equations can have roots that are complex numbers, we need this module to handle complex numbers correctly."}, "finish_reason": "stop"}], "usage": {"prompt_tokens": 0, "completion_tokens": 398, "total_tokens": 398}, "time": "23.65"}

Here is an example of how you could do it:\n\n```python\nimport re\n\nfilename = \"57-1Jn.usfm\"\nmatch = re.search(r'\\b\\w{3}\\b', filename)\nif match:\n    three_character_code = match.group()\n    print(\"Three character code:\", three_character_code)  # Outputs: Three character code: 1Jn\n```\n\nIn this example, `r'\\b\\w{3}\\b'` is the regular expression that matches a three-character code. Here's what it does:\n\n- `\\b`: This asserts position at a word boundary (the position where a word character is not followed or preceded by another word-character).\n- `\\w{3}`: This matches exactly 3 \"word\" characters. A \"word\" character in regex terms is either a letter, digit, or underscore.\n- `\\b`: This asserts position at another word boundary.\n\nIf you want to include hyphenated words (like \"1Jn\") in your match, replace the regular expression with this one: \n\n```python\nmatch = re.search(r'\\b\\w+-\\w+\\b', filename)\n```"}, "finish_reason": "stop"}], "usage": {"prompt_tokens": 0, "completion_tokens": 307, "total_tokens": 307}, "time": "18.77"}

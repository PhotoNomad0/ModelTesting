Here is an example:\n\n```python\nimport statistics\n\nnumbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]\n\naverage = statistics.mean(numbers)\nstd_dev = statistics.stdev(numbers)\n\nprint(\"Average:\", average)\nprint(\"Standard Deviation:\", std_dev)\n```\n\nIn this example, the mean (average) of the numbers is calculated by adding them all up and dividing by the count of numbers. The standard deviation is a measure of how spread out numbers are; it's calculated by taking the square root of the average of the squared differences from the mean."}, "finish_reason": "stop"}], "usage": {"prompt_tokens": 0, "completion_tokens": 177, "total_tokens": 177}, "time": "9.83"}

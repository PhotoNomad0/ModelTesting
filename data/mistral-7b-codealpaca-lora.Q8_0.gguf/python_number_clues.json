Here's how you could do it:\n\n```python\ndef find_number(start, end):\n    for num in range(start+1, end):\n        if (num == num**2 + 1) and is_prime(num):\n            return num\n    return \"No such number found\"\n    \ndef is_prime(n):\n    if n <= 1:\n        return False\n    elif n <= 3:\n        return True\n    elif n % 2 == 0 or n % 3 == 0:\n        return False\n    i = 5\n    while (i * i <= n):\n        if (n % i == 0 or n % (i + 2) == 0):\n            return False\n        i += 6\n    return True\n        \nstart = 20\nend = 40\nprint(find_number(start, end))\n```\nIn this program, `is_prime()` is a helper function that checks if a number is prime or not. The main function `find_number()` iterates over the numbers in the given range and returns the first number which satisfies all the conditions: it's more than 1, one more than a perfect square, and a prime number. If no such number is found, it returns \"No such number found\".\n\nThe condition that the number is one more than a square number means we need to check if `num**2 + 1` is equal to `num`. This only happens for `num = 1, 4, 9, 16, 25, 36, 49, 64, 81`, but for these numbers `is_prime()` returns `False` because they are not prime. Therefore, we need to increment `num` by one in the loop.\n\nNote: This program might be slow if the range of numbers is large due to checking each number for primality which can be expensive operation. There are more efficient ways to check primality such as the Sieve of Eratosthenes algorithm."}, "finish_reason": "stop"}], "usage": {"prompt_tokens": 0, "completion_tokens": 484, "total_tokens": 484}, "time": "28.39"}

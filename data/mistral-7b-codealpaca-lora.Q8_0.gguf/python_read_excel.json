Here is a simple example of how you could define such a function:\n\n```python\nimport pandas as pd\n\ndef read_excel(filepath):\n    # Use pandas to read Excel file\n    df = pd.read_excel(filepath)\n    \n    return df\n```\n\nIn this example, the function `read_excel()` accepts a string argument `filepath`, which is the path to the excel file you want to read. It then uses pandas' built-in `read_excel()` method to read the file and store its content in a DataFrame, which is a 2-dimensional labeled data structure with columns of potentially different types.\n\nYou can use this function like so:\n\n```python\ndf = read_excel('path/to/your/file.xlsx')\nprint(df)\n```\n\nThis will print the contents of the DataFrame `df`, which represents the content of the Excel file."}, "finish_reason": "stop"}], "usage": {"prompt_tokens": 0, "completion_tokens": 245, "total_tokens": 245}, "time": "13.96"}

You can replace 'filepath' with your actual file path. If you are working on the same directory as your python script, you don't need to provide any filepath, just the filename will be enough.\n\nFor example:\n```python\ndf = read_excel('data.xlsx')\n```\n\nPlease note that this function assumes that the excel file is not password protected and also it's a standard xlsx format. If you have different or more complex spreadsheet files (like .odsx for OpenDocument Format), you might need to use other libraries like `openpyxl` for reading open office formats, or `xlrd` for reading old excel 97-2003 formats."}, "finish_reason": "stop"}], "usage": {"prompt_tokens": 0, "completion_tokens": 264, "total_tokens": 264}, "time": "15.42"}

Here's how:\n\nSally considers her two brothers as boys so they are not girls or sisters. We know that each of her brothers has 2 sisters but since we have already counted Sally (who is a sister to the brothers) twice, she doesn't count as a sister again when considering her brothers' sisters. Therefore, Sally has 1 sister in total."}, "finish_reason": "stop"}], "usage": {"prompt_tokens": 0, "completion_tokens": 97, "total_tokens": 97}, "time": "5.37"}

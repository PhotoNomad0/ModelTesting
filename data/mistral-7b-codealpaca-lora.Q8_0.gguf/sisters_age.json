When you were six years old, your sister was likely three years old, which is half of your current age (6/2 = 3).\n\nStep 2: Determine when your sister\u2019s age is now similar to yours. You are currently 80 years old and your sister is older than you. So her age must be closer to yours than when she was three years old. Assuming that 'similar' means 'the same number of decades', then your sister would be in her seventies (as seventy minus thirty-three (your initial six years minus three years) equals fifty-seven, which is close to sixty).\n\nStep 3: Adjust for the fact that you are now eighty. If you have aged an additional twenty years since your sister's 'half your age' phase, your sister must be in her nineties (as ninety minus thirty-three equals seventy-four, which is closer to eighty than fifty-seven).\n\nAssuming that the decades were the most influential factor on their ages and not considering any leap years or irregular birth dates, we can conclude that your sister is currently in her nineties."}, "finish_reason": "stop"}], "usage": {"prompt_tokens": 0, "completion_tokens": 265, "total_tokens": 265}, "time": "14.99"}

When we first read that \"Sally's brothers have 2 sisters,\" we might think that those 2 sisters are Sally's siblings. However, the phrase is not clear enough to determine this for certain. Therefore, according to standard rules of clarity in communication, we must make an assumption or ask for more information to clarify who Sally's \"sisters\" could be.\n\nIf by \"sisters\" it is meant Sally's biological sisters and not her brothers' sisters, then Sally would have 2 siblings who are sisters. However, without further context, we cannot be sure of this. Therefore, the most accurate answer is: Sally has 0 or 2 sisters."}, "finish_reason": "stop"}], "usage": {"prompt_tokens": 0, "completion_tokens": 157, "total_tokens": 157}, "time": "8.73"}

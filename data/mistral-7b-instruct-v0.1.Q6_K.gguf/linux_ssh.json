The ssh command is used to connect to a remote server securely using the Secure Shell protocol (SSH).\n2. The -i flag specifies the location of the SSH key file that will be used for authentication. In this case, it's located at ~/UserKey.pem.\n3. The -C flag enables compressing data sent over the SSH connection for faster transfer speeds.\n4. The -L flag sets up a tunnel from the local machine to the remote server. In this case, it creates a tunnel on port 25900 that maps to port 5900 on the remote server. This allows traffic from the local machine on port 25900 to be forwarded to the remote server on port 5900.\n5.

First, we need to find two numbers that multiply to -1 and add up to 130. We can use trial and error or algebraic methods, but one way to do it is to note that 5*27=135, so subtracting 5 from both sides gives us a number that works:\n-5+130 = 125\nThen we can rewrite the equation as:\nx^3 + x - 130 = 0\n2. Next, we need to find two numbers that multiply to 125 and add up to 0. Again, we can use trial and error or algebraic methods, but one way to do it is to note that (5 \\* 25) + (-7 \\* 5) = 0, so we can rewrite the equation as:\nx^3 + x - 130 = 0\n3. Now we need to substitute a for x and solve for a using Cardano's formula:\na^3 + a - 130 = 0\n(a - 5)(a + 27) = 0\n4. Solving for a, we get two possible solutions:\na = 5 or a = -27\nTherefore, the values of x in the equation x^3+x-130=0 are x=5 and x=-27"}, "finish_reason": "stop"}], "usage": {"prompt_tokens": 0, "completion_tokens": 308, "total_tokens": 308}, "time": "860.00"}

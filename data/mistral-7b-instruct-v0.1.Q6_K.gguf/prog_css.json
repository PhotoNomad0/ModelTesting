First, create a container div and give it a display:flex property. This will start applying flexbox to the container.\n```css\n.container {\n  display: flex;\n}\n```\n2. Add the divs you want to align as children of the container div. Give them a class or id for easy targeting later.\n```html\n<div class=\"container\">\n  <div class=\"div1\"></div>\n  <div class=\"div2\"></div>\n  <div class=\"div3\"></div>\n</div>\n```\n3. To align the divs to the right, you can use the justify-content:flex-end property on the container div. This will position the divs from right to left in the container.\n```css\n.container {\n  display: flex;\n  justify-content: flex-end;\n}\n```\n4. You can also adjust the spacing between the divs by using the flex-basis property. This will give each div a fixed amount of space based on its content and adjust it to fill the remaining space in the container if needed.\n```css\n.container {\n  display: flex;\n  justify-content: flex-end;\n}\n\n.div1, .div2, .div3 {\n  flex-basis: 100%; /* This will give each div 100% of the available space */\n}\n```\nThat's it! You should now have a row of divs aligned to the right using flex in CSS."}, "finish_reason": "stop"}], "usage": {"prompt_tokens": 0, "completion_tokens": 347, "total_tokens": 347}, "time": "18.91"}

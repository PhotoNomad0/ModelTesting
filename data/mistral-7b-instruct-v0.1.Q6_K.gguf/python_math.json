To solve the equation `ax^3 + bx^2 + cx + d = 0` for all possible values of x, you can use the Rational Root Theorem and synthetic division or factoring to find the roots.\n2. First, let's use the Rational Root Theorem to find any rational roots. The theorem states that if a polynomial p(x) has a rational root r/q (where r and q are integers), then either r is a divisor of p(0) or q is a factor of p(-1).\n3. In this case, we have:\n```python\np(x) = ax^3 + bx^2 + cx + d\n```\nTo find the roots, you can use different methods such as Newton's method or the quadratic formula.\n4. For example, to find the roots of the equation `ax^3 + bx^2 + cx + d = 0`, you can use synthetic division to divide the polynomial by `(x - r)` for each possible rational root `r`. If any of the quotients are not zero, then that is a root of the polynomial.\n5. Here's an example code snippet in Python using the Rational Root Theorem and synthetic division:\n```python\ndef solve_cubic(a, b, c, d):\n    # Find possible rational roots using the Rational Root Theorem\n    roots = []\n    for i in range(1, int(d / a) + 2):\n        if gcd(a, i) == 1 and gcd(b, i) == 1:\n            root = i\n            if root * root * root - 4 * b / a + d / a == 0:\n                roots.append(root)\n    # Find other roots using synthetic division\n    for r in range(-int(c / a) - 1, int(c / a) + 2):\n        q = (a, b, c, d)\n        p = (r, a, b, c, d)\n        if gcd(a, r) == 1 and gcd(b, r) == 1:\n            temp = synthetic_division(q, p)\n            if len(temp) > 0 and temp[0][-1] != 0:\n                root = r\n                roots.append(root)\n    return roots\ndef gcd(a, b):\n    while b != 0:\n        a, b = b, a % b\n    return abs(a)\ndef synthetic_division(q, p):\n    k = len(p) - len(q) + 1\n    temp = [[0] * k for i in range(k)]\n    for i in range(k):\n        for j in range(len(p)):\n            temp[i][j] = q[j]\n        for j in range(len(q)):\n            temp[i][j] -= p[j] * temp[i - 1][-1]\n    return temp\n```\nYou can call this function with the coefficients of the cubic equation as input:\n```python\ncoeffs = (1, 2, 3, 4) # a=1, b=2, c=3, d=4\nroots = solve_cubic(1, 2, 3, 4)\nprint(roots)\n```"}, "finish_reason": "stop"}], "usage": {"prompt_tokens": 0, "completion_tokens": 772, "total_tokens": 772}, "time": "604.76"}

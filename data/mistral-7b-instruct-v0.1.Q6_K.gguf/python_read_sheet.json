Here is an example of how you can read a CSV file using the `csv` module in Python:\n```python\nimport csv\n\ndef read_csv(file_path):\n    with open(file_path) as csvfile:\n        reader = csv.reader(csvfile)\n        next(reader)  # skip header row\n        for row in reader:\n            print(row)\n```\nThis function takes a file path as an argument and opens the CSV file using the `with open()` context manager. It then uses the `reader` object to iterate over each row in the file, and prints the row to the console. You can modify this function to process the data in whatever way you need.\n2. If your spreadsheet is not a CSV file but an Excel file, you will need to use a different library such as `openpyxl` or `pandas`. Here is an example of how you can use the `openpyxl` library to read an Excel file:\n```python\nimport openpyxl\n\ndef read_excel(file_path):\n    workbook = openpyxl.load_workbook(file_path)\n    worksheet = workbook['Sheet1']  # replace 'Sheet1' with the name of your worksheet\n    for row in range(1, worksheet.max_row + 1):\n        print(worksheet[row])\n```\nThis function takes a file path as an argument and loads the Excel file using the `load_workbook()` method from the `openpyxl` library. It then selects the first worksheet in the file (you can replace 'Sheet1' with the name of your worksheet) and iterates over each row in the worksheet, printing the row to the console.\n\nYou can also use pandas to read excel files. Here is an example:\n```python\nimport pandas as pd\n\ndef read_excel(file_path):\n    df = pd.read_excel(file_path)\n    for index, row in df.iterrows():\n        print(row)\n```\nThis function takes a file path as an argument and uses the `read_excel()` method from the pandas library to read the excel file into a dataframe. It then iterates over each row in the dataframe, printing the row to the console."}, "finish_reason": "stop"}], "usage": {"prompt_tokens": 0, "completion_tokens": 534, "total_tokens": 534}, "time": "29.53"}

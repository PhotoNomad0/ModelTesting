They can be classified into several categories:\n\n1. **Tropes**: These include metaphor, simile, metonymy, synecdoche, irony, hyperbole, personification, and symbolism. Tropes are figures of speech that involve the substitution or reinterpretation of words to create a new meaning.\n    - Metaphor: Comparing two unrelated things without using \"like\" or \"as\", e.g., \"Time is money.\"\n    - Simile: Using \"like\" or \"as\" to compare two things, e.g., \"He is as strong as an ox.\"\n    - Metonymy: Substituting a part for the whole, e.g., \"The White House refers to the US government.\n    - Irony: Saying something opposite of what you mean, e.g., \"I'm glad it stopped raining.\"\n    - Personification: Giving human qualities to non-human objects or ideas, e.g., \"The sun smiled on us today.\"\n    - Symbolism: Using an object to represent a concept, e.g., the dove for peace.\n\n2. **Schemes**: These involve sound patterns and include alliteration, assonance, consonance, rhyme, onomatopoeia, and puns.\n    - Alliteration: Repetition of initial consonant sounds in words close together, e.g., \"Peter Piper picked a peck of pickled peppers.\"\n    - Assonance: Repeating vowel sounds within words, e.g., \"She sells seashells by the seashore.\"\n    - Rhyme: Repetition of final sounds, e.g., \"The cat sat on the mat.\"\n    - Onomatopoeia: Words that sound like their meaning, e.g., \"Meow\" for a cat's sound.\n    - Puns: Words with multiple meanings, e.g., \"A bear can be hairy.\"\n\n3. **Irony**: This is a figure of speech that uses contrast between intended and actual meanings, such as verbal irony or sarcasm.\n4. **Rhetorical questions**: Asking for effect rather than seeking an answer, e.g., \"What good did it do?\"\n5. **Apostrophe**: Addressing an absent person or idea directly, e.g., \"O Romeo, Romeo, why dost thou deny?\"\n6. **Parallelism**: Repeating grammatical structures for emphasis, e.g., \"To be or not to be.\"\n7. **Repetition**: Using words multiple times for effect, e.g., \"We will, we will, we will.\"\n8. **Euphemism**: Substituting milder expressions for harsh ones, e.g., \"passed away\" instead of died.\n9. **Metrical figures**: Rhythmic patterns in poetry, e.g., iambic pentameter.\n10. **Climax**: Building to a strong conclusion, e.g., \"Now or never.\"\n11. **Oxymoron**: Contradictory terms together, e.g., \"deafening silence.\"\n12. **Apostrophe**: Speaking to oneself, e.g., \"To be or not to be.\"\n13. **Antithesis**: Balancing opposites, e.g., \"Blessed are the peacemakers.\"\n14. **Epistrophe**: Repetition of words or phrases, e.g., \"We will, we will.\"\n15. **Satire**: Humorously mocking, e.g., \"The king was a real jester.\"\n16. **Aphorism**: Brief sayings with wisdom, e.g., \"Less is more.\"\n17. **Zeugma**: Connecting sentences without conjunctions, e.g., \"I am tired and hungry.\"\n18. **Syllepsis**: Changing word order for effect, e.g., \"Barefoot runner.\"\n19. **Ametaphor**: Reversed metaphors, e.g., \"Moon, noonday sun.\"\n20. **Zeugma**: Combining two meanings, e.g., \"He's a real gentleman.\"\n\nThese are some of the most common categories of figures of speech. There can be more depending on context and language."}, "finish_reason": "stop"}], "usage": {"prompt_tokens": 84, "completion_tokens": 990, "total_tokens": 1074}, "time": "58.78"}

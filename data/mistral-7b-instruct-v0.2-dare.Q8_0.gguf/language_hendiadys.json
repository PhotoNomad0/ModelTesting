It is derived from the Greek word hendyadys, meaning \"together.\" This literary device creates a powerful effect by connecting two ideas that complement each other or have a close relationship. For example, in the phrase \"love and war,\" love represents one idea while war represents another, and both are linked to convey the notion of strong emotions or experiences that go hand-in-hand. It is commonly used in literature, poetry, and rhetoric to create a more impactful statement."}, "finish_reason": "stop"}], "usage": {"prompt_tokens": 83, "completion_tokens": 138, "total_tokens": 221}, "time": "8.30"}

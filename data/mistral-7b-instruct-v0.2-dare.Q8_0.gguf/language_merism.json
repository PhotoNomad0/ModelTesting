It involves dividing a concept into its parts and then combining them to express a whole. This technique is often used in literature, poetry, and rhetoric to create vivid imagery or emphasize a point. For example, \"from head to toe\" or \"from dawn to dusk\" are both merisms that refer to the entirety of a person's body or a day, respectively. Merisms can be either cumulative (combining parts for emphasis) or distributive (separating something into two halves). They help create a more vivid and expressive way of describing an object or idea by highlighting its extent or range."}, "finish_reason": "stop"}], "usage": {"prompt_tokens": 81, "completion_tokens": 161, "total_tokens": 242}, "time": "9.32"}

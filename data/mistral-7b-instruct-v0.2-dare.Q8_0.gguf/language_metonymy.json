It's a type of figurative language that replaces the name of an object with another related concept. For example, when we say \"the White House\" instead of \"the President,\" we are using metonymy because \"White House\" is a metaphorical representation for the U.S. government or administration. It's a way to refer to something by mentioning something closely associated with it, rather than directly naming it. Metonymies can be used in literature, speech, and everyday language to create more vivid imagery or make communication more concise and evocative. They are often based on real-world associations that the audience is likely to understand."}, "finish_reason": "stop"}], "usage": {"prompt_tokens": 82, "completion_tokens": 171, "total_tokens": 253}, "time": "9.86"}

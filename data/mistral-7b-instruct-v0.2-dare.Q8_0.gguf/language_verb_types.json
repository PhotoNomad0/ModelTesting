Action verbs: These describe an action being performed by a subject, such as \"run,\" \"walk,\" or \"jump.\" They indicate that something is happening.\n2. Linking verbs: Also known as copula verbs, these connect the subject to a predicate noun or adjective and express a state of being, like \"is,\" \"seem,\" or \"appear.\"\n3. Helping verbs: These are auxiliary verbs that modify main verbs to form tenses, voice, or aspect, such as \"can,\" \"will,\" or \"may.\"\n4. Modal verbs: They show possibility, necessity, or probability, like \"might,\" \"should,\" or \"must.\"\n5. State of being verbs: These express a state or condition, such as \"be,\" \"seem,\" or \"feel.\"\n6.

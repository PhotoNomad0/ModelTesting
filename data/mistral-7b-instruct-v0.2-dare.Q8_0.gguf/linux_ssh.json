Let's break it down:\n\n- `ssh`: This is the Secure Shell (SSH) command that allows you to log in to another computer over an encrypted network connection.\n- `-i \"~/UserKey.pem\"`: Specifies the path and name of the private key file for authentication, which will be used to authenticate with the remote server. The `~` represents your home directory, so it's equivalent to the user's home directory. If you are on a different directory, adjust accordingly.\n- `-C`: Enables compression of all data (to reduce the amount of transmitted data).\n- `user@ec2-34-221-131-108.us-west-2.compute.amazonaws.com`: The username and hostname or IP address of the remote server you want to connect to, in this case \"user\" is the username and \"ec2-34-221-131-108.us-west-2.compute.amazonaws.com\" is the hostname or IP address of the server.\n- `-L 25900:localhost:5900`: This option creates a local (forwarding) port forwarding, which means all traffic sent to your local port 25900 will be redirected to the remote server's port 5900. In other words, it forwards connections from your local machine's port 25900 to the remote server's port 5900.\n\nIn short, this command allows you to connect to the specified host and set up a tunnel that will forward traffic between your local port 25900 to the remote server's port 5900 for secure communication."}, "finish_reason": "stop"}], "usage": {"prompt_tokens": 142, "completion_tokens": 451, "total_tokens": 593}, "time": "22.96"}

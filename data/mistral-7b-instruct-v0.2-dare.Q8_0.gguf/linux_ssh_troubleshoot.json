This could be due to one of the following reasons:\n\n1. The private key file is not in the correct format or contains incorrect data. Ensure that the file is a valid OpenSSH-compatible RSA, DSA, ECDSA, or Ed25519 private key and not corrupted.\n2. The user does not have read permissions for the key file. Check the file's permissions using \"ls -l ~/UserKey.pem\" to verify if it is readable by the current user. If not, use \"chmod 600 ~/UserKey.pem\" to set appropriate permissions.\n3. The private key may be in an incorrect format or has a different name than expected. Verify that the file name and path are correct.\n4. The SSH client is unable to find the private key file. Check if it's located at the specified path \"~/UserKey.pem\" and make sure it exists.\n5. The public key may not be properly configured on the remote server. Ensure that the public key has been added to the authorized_keys file of the user account on the remote server.\n6. Check if the private key is passphrase protected, and if so, provide the passphrase when prompted for authentication.\n7. The SSH client may be using an incorrect username or hostname. Verify that you are using the correct username and server address.\n8. The SSH daemon on the remote server may not allow public key authentication. Ensure that the server allows public key authentication in its configuration file (sshd_config).\n9. The private key is outdated, try generating a new one with \"ssh-keygen -t rsa -b 2048 -C \"your_email@example.com\" and add it to the remote server's authorized_keys file.\n10. Check if there are any firewall or network issues preventing the connection.\n\nPlease go through these points one by one to resolve the issue.

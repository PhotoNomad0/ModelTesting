To find out how many test tubes are required for the other two experiments combined, we can subtract the number of test tubes used in the first experiment from the total: 8 - 2 = 6 test tubes. Since both of the remaining experiments require the same number of test tubes, divide this number by 2 to find out how many are needed for each: 6 / 2 = 3 test tubes per experiment. Therefore, each of the other two experiments required 3 test tubes."}, "finish_reason": "stop"}], "usage": {"prompt_tokens": 130, "completion_tokens": 135, "total_tokens": 265}, "time": "8.50"}

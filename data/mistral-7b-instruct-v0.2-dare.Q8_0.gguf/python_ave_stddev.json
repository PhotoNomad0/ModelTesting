Here's an example code snippet:\n```python\nfrom statistics import mean, stdev\n\nnumbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9]\naverage = mean(numbers)\nstandard_deviation = stdev(numbers)\nprint(\"Average:\", average)\nprint(\"Standard Deviation:\", standard_deviation)\n```\nThis code will output the average and standard deviation of the given list. The `mean()` function calculates the arithmetic mean (average) and `stdev()` function calculates the sample standard deviation. You can replace the numbers in the list with your own data to get the results for any set of values."}, "finish_reason": "stop"}], "usage": {"prompt_tokens": 89, "completion_tokens": 183, "total_tokens": 272}, "time": "11.13"}

Here's an example of how to do it:\n\n```python\nimport pandas as pd\n\n# Read a CSV file (comma-separated values)\ndf = pd.read_csv('path/to/your/file.csv')\n\n# Read an Excel file (XLSX or XLSX)\ndf = pd.read_excel('path/to/your/file.xlsx')\n```\n\nThe `pandas.read_csv()` and `pandas.read_excel()` functions are used to read data from CSV and Excel files respectively. You can provide the path of your file as a string, and they will return a DataFrame object that you can manipulate easily."}, "finish_reason": "stop"}], "usage": {"prompt_tokens": 85, "completion_tokens": 188, "total_tokens": 273}, "time": "11.43"}

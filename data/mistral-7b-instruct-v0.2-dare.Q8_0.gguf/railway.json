This measurement was established in the United Kingdom during the early days of rail transport development and has become the most widely used width for tracks around the world. The origin of this specific distance can be traced back to George Stephenson, a British engineer who designed the Locomotion, the first steam-powered locomotive, which was built with a wheelbase of 4 feet 8 inches in 1814. However, it wasn't until the Great Northern Railway Company adopted this gauge in 1846 that it became an official standard for British railways. The decision to use this width was made to accommodate both the locomotives and carriages from different manufacturers without having to modify their designs for each other's tracks. This allowed interoperability between various railway companies, thus promoting efficiency and reducing costs. The 1435mm gauge was chosen as it provided a good balance between stability and maneuverability on curves while still allowing enough space for the wheels of carriages to pass without any issues.\n\nThe standardization of this width spread globally after the British Empire expanded, with their colonies adopting it due to its use in India, Canada, Australia, and Africa. As a result, the gauge became widely used in countries that were part of the British Commonwealth or had significant trade relations with them. The adoption of standard gauge has continued to grow as railways developed, making it the most common track width worldwide. Today, over 60% of the world's total railway mileage uses this measurement."}, "finish_reason": "stop"}], "usage": {"prompt_tokens": 84, "completion_tokens": 372, "total_tokens": 456}, "time": "21.31"}

Here's an example of using it:\n\n```javascript\n// First, check if the browser supports the File System Access API\nif (window.showSaveFilePicker) {\n  // Create a File object with the desired file name and type\n  const file = new File([], \"my-text-file.txt\", { type: \"text/plain\" });\n\n  // Show the save file dialog to the user\n  showSaveFilePicker().then(async function (saveFileHandle) {\n    // Write the text to the chosen file\n    const writer = await saveFileHandle.createWritable();\n    await writer.write(\"Hello, world!\");\n\n    // Close the file\n    await writer.close();\n  });\n} else {\n  // Fallback for browsers that don't support the File System Access API\n  console.error('Your browser does not support the File System Access API.');\n}\n```\n\nPlease note that the File System Access API is still experimental, and it might not be available in all browsers yet. In case you need to support older browsers or provide a fallback solution, you can use HTML5's FileSaver.js library (https://github.com/eligrey/FileSaver.js) which enables downloading the text as a file in a user's browser.\n\nHere's an example of using FileSaver.js:\n\n```javascript\nconst textToSave = \"Hello, world!\";\n\n// Create a blob with the given text\nconst blob = new Blob([textToSave], { type: \"text/plain\" });\n\n// Call the download method to save the file\nsaveAs(blob, \"my-text-file.txt\");\n```\n\nHowever, using FileSaver.js will result in a temporary download on the user's computer rather than a saved file on their local system."}, "finish_reason": "stop"}], "usage": {"prompt_tokens": 0, "completion_tokens": 439, "total_tokens": 439}, "time": "52.86"}

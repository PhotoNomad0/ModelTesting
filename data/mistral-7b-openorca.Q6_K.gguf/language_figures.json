Metaphor: A figure where a word or phrase is applied to an object or action to which it is not literally applicable. Example: \"Life is a journey.\"\n2. Simile: A figure comparing two different things by using the words 'like' or 'as'. Example: The cat slept like a baby.\n3. Personification: A figure where human qualities are attributed to non-human objects, animals, or ideas. Example: The sun was gazing down upon the earth.\n4. Hyperbole: A figure of exaggeration used for emphasis. Example: I have a million things to do today.\n5. Litotes: A figure in which an affirmative is expressed by negating its opposite. Example: She isn't bad at painting. (This means she's actually quite good.)\n6. Clich\u00e9: A phrase or expression that has been overused and is now trite or uninteresting. Example: \"Too many cooks spoil the broth.\"\n7. Idiom: An expression that cannot be understood literally, but rather depends on its contextual meaning. Example: He's as mad as a hornet.\n8. Euphemism: A mild or indirect way of referring to something considered unpleasant or embarrassing. Example: Instead of saying \"You died,\" we say \"He passed away.\"\n9. Oxymoron: A figure where contradictory or incongruous words are combined, creating a new and often poetic effect. Example: Actual innocence.\n10. Onomatopoeia: A word that phonetically imitates the sound it describes. Example: Buzz, hiss, crackle.\n\nNonverbal Figures include:\n1. Metonymy: A figure where one word is substituted by another closely related to it. Example: \"The crown\" in reference to a king or queen.\n2. Synecdoche: A figure where a part represents the whole, or vice versa. Example: Using \"hands\" to refer to a skilled worker, or using \"wheels\" to refer to a car.\n3. Apostrophe: A figure where the speaker addresses an absent or inanimate object directly. Example: \"Ode to a Grecian Urn.\"\n\nComprehensive Figures include:\n1. Irony: A figure where there is an unexpected twist, often involving a contrast between expectation and reality. Examples: Verbal irony (saying one thing but meaning its opposite), situational irony (when events unfold in a way contrary to expectations), and dramatic irony (when the audience knows something that the characters do not).\n2. Paradox: A figure where seemingly contradictory statements are true at the same time, leading to a deepened understanding of a concept. Examples: \"The more you try to control things, the less you can control them,\" or \"Absolute power corrupts absolutely.\"\n3. Allusion: A figure where a reference is made to something well-known, without explicitly stating it. Example: The phrase \"Achilles heel\" refers to a vulnerable point or weakness in someone's character."}, "finish_reason": "stop"}], "usage": {"prompt_tokens": 0, "completion_tokens": 725, "total_tokens": 725}, "time": "92.77"}

Some common verb classifications include:\n\n1. Action Verbs: These express an action or activity being performed by the subject, e.g., \"run,\" \"jump,\" \"eat.\"\n2. State of Being Verbs (Linking Verbs): These verbs connect the subject to a state or condition, e.g., \"is,\" \"are,\" \"was,\" \"were.\"\n3. Helping Verbs: Also called auxiliary verbs, they are used alongside main (or lexical) verbs to express tense, voice, aspect, and mood, e.g., \"can,\" \"could,\" \"do,\" \"does.\"\n4. Modal Verbs: These are a specific type of helping verb that indicates the level of certainty or possibility surrounding an action, e.g., \"may,\" \"might,\" \"will,\" \"would.\"\n5. Transitive Verbs: These verbs require a direct object to complete their meaning, e.g., \"write,\" \"build,\" \"eat.\"\n6. Intransitive Verbs: These verbs do not require a direct object and can stand on their own as complete sentences, e.g., \"sneeze,\" \"arrive,\" \"shudder.\"\n7. Reflexive Verbs: These verbs involve the subject and object referring to the same person or thing, e.g., \"dress,\" \"wash,\" \"shave.\"\n8. Causative Verbs: These verbs express an action that causes another action, e.g., \"make,\" \"cause,\" \"force.\"\n9. Passive Verbs: These verbs indicate that the focus is on the recipient of an action rather than the doer of the action, e.g., \"is given,\" \"was built.\"\n\nKeep in mind that some verbs can belong to multiple categories, depending on their context and usage."}, "finish_reason": "stop"}], "usage": {"prompt_tokens": 0, "completion_tokens": 428, "total_tokens": 428}, "time": "54.19"}

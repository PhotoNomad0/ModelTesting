Incorrect key file path: Ensure that the path to the private key specified with \"-i\" option is correct and points to the actual location of the .pem file on your local machine.\n\n2. Missing or incomplete public key on the remote server: Log in to the Amazon EC2 instance via a web browser using the AWS Management Console, navigate to the instance's \"Network & Security\" section, and check if the public key is correctly added to the list of authorized keys. If it's not there, add it by following this guide: https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/ec2-key-pair-Linux.html#adding-linux\n\n3. Corrupted key file: Ensure that the .pem file is not corrupted or altered in any way. If it has been modified, recreate the key pair and use the new key file in your command.\n\n4. Permissions issue on the local machine: Make sure that you have the correct read/write permissions on the private key file. It's recommended to set the file permissions to 600 (read-only for owner) before using it with SSH. You can do this using the \"chmod\" command:\n\n```bash\nchmod 600 ~/UserKey.pem\n```\n\nIf you are still having trouble, please provide more details about your key setup and the specific steps you have taken so far to resolve the issue."}, "finish_reason": "stop"}], "usage": {"prompt_tokens": 0, "completion_tokens": 396, "total_tokens": 396}, "time": "51.17"}

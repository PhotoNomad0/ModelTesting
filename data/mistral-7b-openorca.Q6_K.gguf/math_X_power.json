In this case, we can factor out 2^X from both terms:\n(2^X)(8^X) + (2^X)(1) = 130\n\nStep 2: Simplify the equation by dividing both sides by 2^X:\n8^X + 1 = 130/2^X\n\nStep 3: Now, we need to find a power of 2 that would make the right-hand side equal to 130. We can do this by trial and error or using the properties of logarithms to simplify the equation further. Since log(b^x) = x log(b), let's take the log base 2 of both sides:\nlog_2(8^X + 1) = log_2(130/2^X)\n\nStep 4: Apply the property of logarithms for the power:\nX * log_2(8) = log_2(130) - X * log_2(2)\n\nStep 5: Solve for X by using the identity log_b(a) = (log_c(a)) / (log_c(b)):\nX = ((log_2(130))/log_2(8)) / (1 - log_2(2)/log_2(8))\n\nStep 6: Evaluate the expression inside the parentheses:\nX \u2248 2.94\n\nSo, X \u2248 2.94 in the given equation."}, "finish_reason": "stop"}], "usage": {"prompt_tokens": 0, "completion_tokens": 382, "total_tokens": 382}, "time": "48.49"}

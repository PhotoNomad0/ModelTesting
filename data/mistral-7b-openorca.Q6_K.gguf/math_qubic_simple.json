Since 521 is not a perfect square, the equation x^3 + x - 130 = 0 does not have any real roots. The roots are complex conjugates.\n\nNow we need to find the imaginary cube root of the constant term (-130) and then the remaining two cube roots using Cardano's formula:\n\nLet u = \u221a[(-1/2)(-130)] = \u221a(65). The possible values for u are \u00b1\u221a(65).\n\nUsing Cardano's formula, we get the three roots as:\n\nx_1 = u - (b/3a) = \u221a(65) - 1/3\nx_2 = u + (b/3a) = -\u221a(65) - 1/3\nx_3 = x_1*u = -\u221a((65)^2 / 9) - 1/3\nx_4 = x_2*u = \u221a(((65)^2 / 9) - 27) - 1/3\n\nHowever, since the discriminant is not a perfect square, we can only find two of the roots and they are complex conjugates. The remaining root is infinity or imaginary. In this case, the two non-real roots are:\n\nx = -(\u221a((65)^2 / 9) - 1)/3 + i*(\u221a(((65)^2 / 9) - 27))/3\nx = (-\u221a(65)/3) + i*\u221a(65)/3\n\nSo, the two non-real roots are complex conjugates of each other."}, "finish_reason": "stop"}], "usage": {"prompt_tokens": 0, "completion_tokens": 510, "total_tokens": 510}, "time": "66.85"}

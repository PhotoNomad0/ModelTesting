He established a gauge of 4 feet 8.5 inches (1,435 millimeters) between the inner sides of the rails.\n\nThe choice of this specific width was primarily influenced by practical considerations and cost-effectiveness. The dimensions were based on the wheel diameter and axle length commonly used in horse-drawn wagons during that time. Stephenson's decision aimed to ensure compatibility with existing wagon technology, allowing smooth integration of railways into the existing transportation network while promoting widespread adoption of this new mode of transport.\n\nThe standard gauge soon gained popularity across Europe and later spread to other parts of the world as well. It became a widely accepted norm due to its versatility and efficiency in accommodating various types of locomotives, rolling stock, and infrastructure designs. Today, the 1435 mm (or 4 feet 8.5 inches) standard gauge is used in many countries worldwide, serving as a benchmark for railway systems."}, "finish_reason": "stop"}], "usage": {"prompt_tokens": 0, "completion_tokens": 242, "total_tokens": 242}, "time": "30.86"}

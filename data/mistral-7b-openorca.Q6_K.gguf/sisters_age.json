First, we need to find out how many years have passed since you were 6.\n2. You are currently 80 years old, so the number of years that have passed is 80 - 6 = 74 years.\n3. Your sister was half your age when you were 6, which means she was (1/2) * 6 = 3 years old.\n4. Now, to determine her current age, we need to add the 74 years that have passed to her initial age of 3: 3 + 74 = 77 years old.\n5.

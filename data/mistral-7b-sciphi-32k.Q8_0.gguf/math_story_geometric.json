Since the notepad is made from 5 letter size pieces of paper folded three times and stacked, there will be 5 * 3 = 15 sheets of paper. Let's assume that each sheet has enough space for 4 notes.\n\nNow we know that a notepad can hold 15 sheets * 4 notes per sheet = 60 notes in total. If someone writes 10 notes per day, the notepad will last them for 60 notes / 10 notes per day = 6 days."}, "finish_reason": "stop"}], "usage": {"prompt_tokens": 0, "completion_tokens": 141, "total_tokens": 141}, "time": "7.76"}

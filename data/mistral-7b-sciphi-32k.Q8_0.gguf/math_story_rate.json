So in 5 minutes:\n9 words/minute * 5 minutes = 45 words\n\nAfter breaking his arm, Cam could only type 6 words per minute with his left hand. So in 5 minutes:\n6 words/minute * 5 minutes = 30 words\n\nThe difference between the number of words he could type before and after breaking his arm is:\n45 words (before) - 30 words (after) = 15 words\n\nSo, Cam can type 15 more words in 5 minutes with his right arm than with his left hand."}, "finish_reason": "stop"}], "usage": {"prompt_tokens": 0, "completion_tokens": 189, "total_tokens": 189}, "time": "10.49"}

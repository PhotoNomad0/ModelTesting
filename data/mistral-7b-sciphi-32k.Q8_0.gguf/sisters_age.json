You are currently 80 years old and your sister is half your age, so her current age would be 80 / 2 = 40 years old.\n\nStep 2: Subtract the difference in ages from the present day to find out how old your sister was when you were 6 years old. Since the difference between your current age and your sister's current age is 40 - 80 = -40, your sister was 40 + 40 = 80 years old when you were 6.\n\nSo, your sister is now 80 years old."}, "finish_reason": "stop"}], "usage": {"prompt_tokens": 0, "completion_tokens": 154, "total_tokens": 154}, "time": "9.37"}

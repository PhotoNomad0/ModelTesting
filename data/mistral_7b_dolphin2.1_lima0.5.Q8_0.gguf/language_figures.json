Metaphor: A figure of speech in which a word or phrase is applied to an object or action to which it is not literally applicable. For example, \"John is an ocean\" implies that John has vast depths and unlimited potential.\n\n2. Simile: A figure of speech involving the comparison between two different things using \"like\" or \"as.\" For instance, \"She runs like the wind.\"\n\n3. Personification: Attributing human qualities to non-human entities such as animals, objects, or ideas. Example: \"The sun smiled upon us today.\"\n\n4. Hyperbole: Exaggeration for emphasis. It is used to make a point more forcefully by overstating the case. For example, \"I have a million things to do!\"\n\n5. Irony: A figure of speech in which there is an incongruity between what one expects and reality. There are three types of irony - verbal (saying something different from its literal meaning), situational (a situation develops contrary to expectation), and dramatic (characters express thoughts or feelings that contrast with their true nature).\n\n6. Onomatopoeia: The formation of a word by imitating the sound it represents, such as \"buzz\" or \"crash.\"\n\n7. Paradox: A statement that seems self-contradictory but may contain some truth. For example, \"The more you try to avoid something, the more likely it is to happen.\"\n\n8. Clich\u00e9: An overused expression or phrase that has lost its original impact due to frequent use. Examples include \"break a leg\" and \"it's raining cats and dogs.\"\n\n9. Alliteration: The repetition of initial consonant sounds in neighboring words, phrases, or clauses. For instance, \"Peter Piper picked peppers.\"\n\n10. Assonance: Repetition of similar vowel sounds within close proximity in a sentence or verse line to create rhythm and musical quality. Example: \"She sells seashells by the seashore.\""}, "finish_reason": "stop"}], "usage": {"prompt_tokens": 0, "completion_tokens": 446, "total_tokens": 446}, "time": "24.93"}

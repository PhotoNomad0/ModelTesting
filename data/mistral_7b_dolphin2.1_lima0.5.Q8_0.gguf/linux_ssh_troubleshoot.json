This can happen if you do not have permission to access or read this file, or if it is located in a directory with restricted permissions.\n\nTo resolve this issue:\n1. Ensure that the private key file has proper permissions set for your user account (typically 600). You may need to use `chmod` command to change its permission. For example: `chmod 600 ~/UserKey.pem`.\n2. Verify if you have read access to the directory where the private key file is located. If not, adjust the permissions of that directory using `chmod` as well.\n3. Check if your user account has permission to read and execute the SSH command (ssh). This can be done by running `ls -l ~/.ssh/config`. The output should show that you have read access to this file. If not, adjust its permissions using `chmod` or add your user account to the appropriate group if necessary.\n4. Make sure that the path to the private key in the command is correct and the file exists at that location.\n5. Double-check for any typos or errors in the command itself. Ensure that you are providing the correct hostname, port number, and other parameters."}, "finish_reason": "stop"}], "usage": {"prompt_tokens": 0, "completion_tokens": 295, "total_tokens": 295}, "time": "16.38"}

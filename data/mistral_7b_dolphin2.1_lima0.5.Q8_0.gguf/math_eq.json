Here's a step-by-step breakdown:\n\n1. Subtract 4 from 25: 25 - 4 = 21\n2. Multiply the result by 2: 21 * 2 = 42\n3. Add 3 to the previous result: 42 + 3 = 45\n\nSo, the answer is 45."}, "finish_reason": "stop"}], "usage": {"prompt_tokens": 0, "completion_tokens": 100, "total_tokens": 100}, "time": "6.02"}

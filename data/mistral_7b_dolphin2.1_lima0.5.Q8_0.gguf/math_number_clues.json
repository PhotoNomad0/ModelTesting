Let's go through each condition step by step.\n\n1. Not a prime number: A prime number is any natural number greater than 1 that cannot be formed by multiplying two smaller natural numbers. The smallest non-prime integer in the given range (20 to 40) is 22, which can be factored as 2 * 11 or 3 * 7.\n\n2. Between 20 and 40: We already know that 22 meets this condition since it's within the specified range of numbers (20 to 40).\n\n3. One more than a square number: A square number is an integer that can be obtained by multiplying another integer with itself. For example, 1 * 1 = 1, 2 * 2 = 4, and so on. To find the smallest square number in our range (20 to 40), we simply look at the first few squares:\n   1^2 =  1\n   2^2 =  4\n   3^2 =  9\n   4^2 = 16\n   5^2 = 25\n\nThe smallest square number greater than or equal to 20 is 25. Therefore, the next integer (one more) in this sequence would be:\n   25 + 1 = 26\n\nSo based on all three conditions, we can conclude that you are referring to the number 22 as it meets all requirements: not a prime number, between 20 and 40, and one more than a square number."}, "finish_reason": "stop"}], "usage": {"prompt_tokens": 0, "completion_tokens": 375, "total_tokens": 375}, "time": "20.99"}

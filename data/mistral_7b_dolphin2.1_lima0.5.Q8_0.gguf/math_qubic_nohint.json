Since this is a cubic equation, we could try to factor it into three linear factors or look for rational roots. However, since the coefficients are not all integers, factoring may be difficult.\n\nLet's start with finding possible rational roots by checking divisors of 130:\n\nThe divisors of 130 are: 1, 2, 5, 10, 13, 26, 39, and 65. We can test each one as a potential root to see if it satisfies the equation.\n\nTesting x = 1:\n(1)^3 + 1 - 130 = -128 (not equal to zero)\n\nTesting x = 2:\n(2)^3 + 2 - 130 = -126 (not equal to zero)\n\nTesting x = 5:\n(5)^3 + 5 - 130 = -70 (not equal to zero)\n\nTesting x = 10:\n(10)^3 + 10 - 130 = 20 (not equal to zero)\n\nTesting x = 13:\n(13)^3 + 13 - 130 = 46 (not equal to zero)\n\nTesting x = 26:\n(26)^3 + 26 - 130 = -58 (not equal to zero)\n\nTesting x = 39:\n(39)^3 + 39 - 130 = 46 (not equal to zero)\n\nTesting x = 65:\n(65)^3 + 65 - 130 = -285 (not equal to zero)\n\nNone of the divisors of 130 are roots for this equation. Therefore, we can conclude that there are no rational roots for this cubic equation. To find an approximate solution, we could use numerical methods such as Newton's method or the bisection method."}, "finish_reason": "stop"}], "usage": {"prompt_tokens": 0, "completion_tokens": 453, "total_tokens": 453}, "time": "25.71"}

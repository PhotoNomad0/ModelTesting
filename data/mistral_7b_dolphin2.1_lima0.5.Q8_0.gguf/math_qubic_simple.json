In this case:\n\na = 1\nb = 1\nc = -130\nd = 0\n\nNow we find two numbers p and q such that p + q = b (p + q = 1) and pq = c/2 (pq = -65). By trying different values of p, we can find the corresponding value for q. For example:\n\nIf p = 0.9, then q = 0.1\nIf p = 0.8, then q = 0.3\nIf p = 0.7, then q = 0.4\n...\n\nWe can continue this process until we find a pair of values for p and q that satisfy both conditions:\n\np + q = b => p + q = 1\npq = c/2 => pq = -65\n\nAfter trying different combinations, we find the following pairs of numbers that work:\n\n(0.983742478, 0.016257522) and (0.983742478, 0.016257522)\n\nNow we can use these values to find the cubic root of our equation:\n\nx = sqrt[a] * (p + q - sqrt(q^2 - pq))\nx = sqrt(1) * (0.983742478 + 0.016257522 - sqrt((0.016257522)^2 - (0.983742478)(0.016257522)))\nx = 1 * (1.000000000)\nx = 1.000000000\n\nSo the solution to the equation x^3 + x - 130 = 0 is approximately x = 1."}, "finish_reason": "stop"}], "usage": {"prompt_tokens": 0, "completion_tokens": 463, "total_tokens": 463}, "time": "26.38"}

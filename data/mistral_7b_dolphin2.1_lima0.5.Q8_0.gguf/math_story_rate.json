Let's assume that Cam types for 5 minutes at each speed. To calculate the difference in the number of words typed:\n\nDifference in words = (speed with right arm) * (time spent typing) - (speed with left arm) * (time spent typing)\nDifference in words = (9 wpm) * (5 min) - (6 wpm) * (5 min)\nDifference in words = 45 words - 30 words\nDifference in words = 15 words\n\nSo, Cam can type 15 more words using his right hand than he could with his left hand over a period of 5 minutes."}, "finish_reason": "stop"}], "usage": {"prompt_tokens": 0, "completion_tokens": 238, "total_tokens": 238}, "time": "13.96"}

We know that Sara needs a total of 8 test tubes:\n\nx + y = 8 (1)\n\nWe also know that all three experiments require an equal amount of test tubes. Therefore, we can say that x is twice the number of test tubes needed for each of the other two experiments:\n\nx = 2y (2)\n\nNow let's solve these equations simultaneously to find out how many test tubes were needed for each of the other two experiments. From equation (1), we can express y as follows:\n\ny = 8 - x\n\nSubstitute this expression into equation (2):\n\nx = 2(8 - x)\n\nSolve for x:\n\nx + x = 16\n2x = 16\nx = 8\n\nNow that we have the value of x, let's find out how many test tubes were needed for each of the other two experiments. Using our expression for y from above:\n\ny = 8 - x\ny = 8 - 8\ny = 0\n\nSo, Sara needed no additional test tubes for either of the other two experiments since she already had enough to perform all three experiments with equal numbers of test tubes."}, "finish_reason": "stop"}], "usage": {"prompt_tokens": 0, "completion_tokens": 280, "total_tokens": 280}, "time": "16.97"}

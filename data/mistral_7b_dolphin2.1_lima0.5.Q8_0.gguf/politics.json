However, I can provide some information on their general stances:\n\nRepublicans generally support free market capitalism, limited government intervention in the economy, traditional social values, and strong national defense. They often prioritize individual rights over collective ones.\n\nDemocrats typically advocate for a more active role of government in regulating markets, providing social services, promoting civil liberties, and addressing issues like climate change or income inequality. They generally support collective rights and emphasize the importance of community and solidarity.\n\nLibertarians are known for their strong belief in individual liberty and minimal government intervention in people's lives. They advocate for free markets, limited government regulation, and self-ownership as a fundamental right.\n\nIt is up to you to decide which party aligns best with your values and beliefs."}, "finish_reason": "stop"}], "usage": {"prompt_tokens": 0, "completion_tokens": 189, "total_tokens": 189}, "time": "10.52"}

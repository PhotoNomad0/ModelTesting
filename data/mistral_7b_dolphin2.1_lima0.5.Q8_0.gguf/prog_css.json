Set the display property for the parent container (the one containing all the divs) to \"flex\". This will enable Flexbox layout on that element.\n2. Add the justify-content property with a value of \"flex-end\" to align the items in the row to the right side.\n3. Set the width and height properties for each div as needed, or set them to auto if you want them to automatically adjust their size based on content.\n\nHere's an example:\n\n```css\n.parent {\n  display: flex;\n  justify-content: flex-end;\n}\n\ndiv {\n  width: 100px;\n  height: 100px;\n  background-color: red;\n  margin: 5px;\n}\n```\n\nThis code will create a row of divs with equal width and height, aligned to the right side of their parent container. You can adjust the properties as needed for your specific use case."}, "finish_reason": "stop"}], "usage": {"prompt_tokens": 0, "completion_tokens": 210, "total_tokens": 210}, "time": "12.77"}

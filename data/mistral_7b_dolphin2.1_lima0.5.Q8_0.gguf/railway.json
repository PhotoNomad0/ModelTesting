It was not chosen arbitrarily but rather developed over time based on practical considerations and technological advancements.\n\nOne significant influence on this gauge came from the British railway system. In 1846, the Great Western Railway (GWR) in Britain adopted a broad gauge of 7 feet (2,134 mm). This was later changed to a standard gauge due to various reasons such as cost savings and operational efficiency. The changeover process took several years and involved converting existing tracks and building new ones with the narrower gauge.\n\nAnother important factor in determining the standard gauge was the need for interoperability between different railways. As more lines were built across Europe, it became clear that a common width would facilitate easier connections between networks. In 1855, at an international conference held in Paris, delegates from various countries agreed on adopting the \"Continental Gauge\" of 1,435 mm as their standard gauge for future construction projects.\n\nIn North America, the United States Army played a significant role in promoting this same width during its westward expansion. The military used railroads to transport troops and supplies across the continent, so they needed consistent gauges along these routes. In 1862, Congress passed legislation requiring all new federal track construction to use the standard gauge of 4 feet 8.5 inches (1,435 mm). This helped ensure compatibility between different railways throughout the country and facilitated faster movement of goods and passengers across long distances.\n\nOver time, other countries also adopted this gauge due to its widespread acceptance and practical benefits. Today, it remains the most common railway gauge worldwide, used in over 60% of all tracks globally. Its success can be attributed to a combination of historical events, technological advancements, and international cooperation that led to its establishment as the global standard for railways."}, "finish_reason": "stop"}], "usage": {"prompt_tokens": 0, "completion_tokens": 431, "total_tokens": 431}, "time": "1111.65"}

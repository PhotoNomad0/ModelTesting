We know that Sally has 3 brothers.\n2. Then we are told that her brothers have 2 sisters each.\n3. Since there is only one set of siblings, the number of sisters for all of Sally's brothers must be equal to the number of sisters Sally has.\n4. Therefore, if each brother has 2 sisters, then collectively they share a total of 6 sisters (3 brothers * 2 sisters per brother).\n5. Since Sally is one of those sisters, she shares her other sister with her brothers.\n\nSo, Sally has only 1 sister."}, "finish_reason": "stop"}], "usage": {"prompt_tokens": 0, "completion_tokens": 130, "total_tokens": 130}, "time": "7.28"}

For each number, it creates an ASCII character using `String.fromCharCode()`, and a hexadecimal string using `toString(16)`. The `padStart()` method is used to ensure that all hexadecimal codes are displayed with two characters, adding a leading zero if necessary.\n\nPlease note that this program will also print out the ASCII characters for values greater than 31, which may not be printable characters and could appear as strange symbols or empty boxes depending on your console or terminal."}, "finish_reason": "stop"}], "usage": {"prompt_tokens": 49, "completion_tokens": 263, "total_tokens": 312}, "time": "1287.12"}

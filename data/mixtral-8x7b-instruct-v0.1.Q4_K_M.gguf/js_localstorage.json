The data will persist even when the browser is closed and reopened. Here's how you can save and retrieve data:\n\nTo save data:\n\n```javascript\nlocalStorage.setItem('key', 'value');\n```\n\nIn this example, 'key' is the identifier for the data you're storing, and 'value' is the data itself. You can replace these with whatever you want.\n\nTo read back the data:\n\n```javascript\nvar value = localStorage.getItem('key');\nconsole.log(value); // This will print the value that was saved\n```\n\nIn this example, 'key' is the same as the key you used when saving the data. This will return the value that was saved, or `null` if no data exists for that key.\n\nRemember to always check if the data exists before trying to read it back, as attempting to read from a non-existent key will return `null`."}, "finish_reason": "stop"}], "usage": {"prompt_tokens": 37, "completion_tokens": 234, "total_tokens": 271}, "time": "75.07"}

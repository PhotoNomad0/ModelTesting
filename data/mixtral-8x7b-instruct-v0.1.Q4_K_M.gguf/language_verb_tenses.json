There are six main verb tenses in English, which can be grouped into three pairs: past, present, and future; and simple, continuous (also called progressive), and perfect. Here's a brief overview of each tense:\n\n1. **Present Simple**: Describes general truths, habits, unchanging situations, and fixed arrangements. Example: \"She reads a book every night.\"\n\n2. **Present Continuous (Progressive)**: Describes actions happening at the current moment or around a specific time in the present. Example: \"He is eating lunch right now.\"\n\n3. **Present Perfect**: Connects the past and the present, emphasizing completion or experience up to the present. Example: \"They have traveled to many countries.\"\n\n4. **Past Simple**: Describes completed actions in the past that occurred at a specific time or for a limited duration. Example: \"I walked the dog yesterday.\"\n\n5. **Past Continuous (Progressive)**: Describes an ongoing action in the past that was interrupted by another action or event. Example: \"She was cooking dinner when her friend arrived.\"\n\n6. **Future Simple**: Describes actions that will happen in the future, often with the help of auxiliary verbs like \"will\" or \"shall.\" Example: \"They will move to a new city next year.\"\n\nThese verb tenses can be combined and modified further to express more complex ideas and situations. Additionally, there are other advanced verb forms such as passive voice, conditional sentences, and subjunctive mood that build upon these basic tenses."}, "finish_reason": "stop"}], "usage": {"prompt_tokens": 29, "completion_tokens": 363, "total_tokens": 392}, "time": "326.13"}

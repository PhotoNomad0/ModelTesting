Here are some common types:\n\n1. **Action Verbs**: These verbs describe an action that a subject performs, such as \"run\", \"jump\", or \"write\".\n\n2. **Linking Verbs**: These verbs connect the subject to additional information about the subject. They often describe the state or condition of the subject. Examples include \"is\", \"am\", \"are\", \"was\", \"were\", \"be\", \"been\", and \"being\".\n\n3. **Helping Verbs**: Also known as auxiliary verbs, they are used with main verbs to create verb tenses, moods, voices, or to form questions and negatives. Examples include \"have\", \"has\", \"had\", \"do\", \"does\", \"did\", \"shall\", \"will\", \"should\", \"would\".\n\n4. **Transitive Verbs**: These verbs require a direct object to complete their meaning. For example, in the sentence \"John ate an apple\", \"ate\" is a transitive verb and \"an apple\" is the direct object.\n\n5. **Intransitive Verbs**: These verbs do not require a direct object. For example, in the sentence \"John laughed\", \"laughed\" is an intransitive verb.\n\n6. **Regular Verbs**: These verbs form the past tense and past participle by adding -ed to the base form. For example, \"walk\" becomes \"walked\".\n\n7. **Irregular Verbs**: These verbs do not follow the regular conjugation rules. Their past tense and past participle forms have to be learned individually. Examples include \"go\", \"be\", \"have\", \"do\".\n\n8. **Modal Verbs**: These are used to express ability, possibility, permission or obligation. Examples include \"can\", \"could\", \"may\", \"might\", \"must\", \"shall\", \"should\", \"will\", \"would\".\n\nRemember, some verbs can function as different types of verbs based on how they are used in a sentence."}, "finish_reason": "stop"}], "usage": {"prompt_tokens": 30, "completion_tokens": 461, "total_tokens": 491}, "time": "408.63"}

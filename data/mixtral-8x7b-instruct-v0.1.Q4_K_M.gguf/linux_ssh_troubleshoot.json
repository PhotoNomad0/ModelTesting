Here are a few things you can check:\n\n1. **Check the file permissions**: The private key (`~/UserKey.pem`) should have `600` permissions and the public key should have `644` permissions. You can set these permissions using the following commands:\n   ```\n   chmod 600 ~/UserKey.pem\n   chmod 644 ~/.ssh/authorized_keys\n   ```\n2. **Check if the private key matches the public key on the server**: The public key should be added to the `~/.ssh/authorized_keys` file on the server. You can check this by logging into the server and running `cat ~/.ssh/authorized_keys`. The output should include the contents of your public key.\n\n3. **Check the syntax of the ssh command**: Make sure you're using the correct syntax for the ssh command. The `-i` option should be followed by the path to your private key file, and the server address should come last.\n\n4. **Check if the server is running and accessible**: Try to SSH into the server without any port forwarding to see if you can connect. If you can't, there might be a problem with the server itself.\n\n5. **Check the status of the ssh-agent**: If you're using an ssh-agent, make sure it's running and that it has your key added. You can check this by running `ssh-add -l`. If your key isn't listed, you can add it with `ssh-add ~/UserKey.pem`.\n\nIf you've checked all of these things and you're still having trouble, there might be a more specific issue at play. In that case, you might want to reach out to AWS support or check their documentation for more specific troubleshooting steps."}, "finish_reason": "stop"}], "usage": {"prompt_tokens": 96, "completion_tokens": 436, "total_tokens": 532}, "time": "830.50"}

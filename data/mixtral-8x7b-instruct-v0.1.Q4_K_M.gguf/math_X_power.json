However, you can approximate the solution using numerical methods or software tools like a graphing calculator or a mathematical software package (like MATLAB, Python with libraries like NumPy, etc.).\n\nHere's how you might approach this with Python:\n\n```python\nimport math\n\ndef f(x):\n    return 8**x + 2**x - 130\n\n# Use the bisection method to find a root of f(x)\na = 0\nb = 10\nc = (a + b) / 2\nwhile abs(f(c)) > 1e-6:\n    if f(a)*f(c) < 0:\n        b = c\n    else:\n        a = c\n    c = (a + b) / 2\n\nprint(\"Approximate solution: \", c)\n```\n\nThis script uses the bisection method to find an approximate solution for X. The actual solution may be slightly different due to the nature of numerical approximation. Please note that this is a simplified example and real-world problems might require more sophisticated methods or tools."}, "finish_reason": "stop"}], "usage": {"prompt_tokens": 41, "completion_tokens": 288, "total_tokens": 329}, "time": "279.73"}

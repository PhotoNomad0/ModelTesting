So, 63 cereal bits divided by 9 designs equals approximately 7 cereal bits per design. However, this is just an average. The actual number of cereal bits used in each design could vary slightly. As for whether she used an equal number of cereal bits in each design, the information provided doesn't specify, but given that the total number of cereal bits is exactly divisible by the number of designs, it's possible that she did use an equal number each time."}, "finish_reason": "stop"}], "usage": {"prompt_tokens": 82, "completion_tokens": 137, "total_tokens": 219}, "time": "718.80"}

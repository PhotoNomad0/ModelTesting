The formula is derived from the depressed cubic form of the equation, which is x\u00b3 + px + q = 0. In your case, a = 1, b = 0, c = 1, and d = -130. So, we first need to convert your equation into the depressed cubic form.\n\nThe given equation is x\u00b3 + x - 130 = 0. Here, p = 1 and q = -130.\n\nCardano's formula for a real root of the cubic equation x\u00b3 + px + q = 0 is:\n\nx = \u221b(-q/2 + \u221a((q/2)\u00b2 + (p/3)\u00b3)) + \u221b(-q/2 - \u221a((q/2)\u00b2 + (p/3)\u00b3))\n\nLet's calculate the values:\n\n1. Calculate (q/2)\u00b2 + (p/3)\u00b3 = (-130/2)\u00b2 + (1/3)\u00b3 = 4422.67 approximately.\n2. Take the square root of (q/2)\u00b2 + (p/3)\u00b3 = \u221a4422.67 \u2248 66.50 approximately.\n3. Now, calculate -q/2 + \u221a((q/2)\u00b2 + (p/3)\u00b3) = -(-130/2) + 66.50 \u2248 83.50 approximately.\n4. And, calculate -q/2 - \u221a((q/2)\u00b2 + (p/3)\u00b3) = -(-130/2) - 66.50 \u2248 17.50 approximately.\n\nNow, we need to cube these values and add them:\n\nx = \u221b83.50 + \u221b17.50\n\nThis is the real root of your cubic equation. Please note that the cube roots are not straightforward numerical operations and may require a calculator or software that can handle complex numbers, as the cube roots of negative numbers are used here."}, "finish_reason": "stop"}], "usage": {"prompt_tokens": 71, "completion_tokens": 485, "total_tokens": 556}, "time": "707.66"}

Solving cubic equations by hand can be quite complex. However, in this case, we can use the rational root theorem to find a rational root. \n\nThe rational root theorem states that any rational zero of a polynomial must be of the form 'p/q' where p is a factor of the constant term and q is a factor of the leading coefficient. In this case, the constant term is -130 and the leading coefficient is 1.\n\nSo, the possible rational roots are: \u00b11, \u00b12, \u00b15, \u00b110, \u00b113, \u00b126, \u00b165, \u00b1130, \u00b1195, \u00b1325, \u00b1650, and \u00b11300.\n\nBy trying these out, we find that x = 5 is a root of the equation because it makes the equation true: 5^3 + 5 - 130 = 125 + 5 - 130 = 0.\n\nNow, we can divide the original equation by (x - 5) to find the other roots. The quotient is a quadratic equation, which can be solved using the quadratic formula or factoring, if possible.\n\nThe division gives: x^2 + 10x + 26 = 0. This quadratic doesn't factor easily, so we can use the quadratic formula to find the other roots: x = -5 \u00b1 sqrt(5^2 - 4*1*26) / (2*1) = -5 \u00b1 sqrt(-91) / 2.\n\nSo, the solutions to the equation are x = 5, and x = -5 +- sqrt(-91) / 2. Note that these last two solutions are complex numbers because sqrt(-91) is an imaginary number."}, "finish_reason": "stop"}], "usage": {"prompt_tokens": 41, "completion_tokens": 411, "total_tokens": 452}, "time": "215.33"}

Cardano's formula is used to solve cubic equations of the form x^3 + px = q. However, your equation x^3 + x - 130 = 0 needs to be put into this form first.\n\nLet's set x^3 = y. Then your equation becomes y + y^(1/3) - 130 = 0. Now we can compare this with the standard form x^3 + px = q. Here, p = 1 and q = -130 + y^(1/3).\n\nCardano's formula is then given by:\n\nx = cbrt[(-q/2) + sqrt((q^2/4) + (p^3/27))] + cbrt[(-q/2) - sqrt((q^2/4) + (p^3/27))]\n\nSubstituting p = 1 and q = -130 + y^(1/3) into this formula will give you the solution for x. However, please note that this is a complex process and might require a calculator or a software to compute. Also, depending on the value of the expression under the cube roots, there might be real or complex solutions."}, "finish_reason": "stop"}], "usage": {"prompt_tokens": 48, "completion_tokens": 293, "total_tokens": 341}, "time": "435.54"}

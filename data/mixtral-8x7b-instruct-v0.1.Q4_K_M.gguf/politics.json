However, I can provide you with some information about each of these political groups. \n\nRepublicans generally favor limited government intervention in the economy and more robust national defense. They often lean conservative on social issues.\n\nDemocrats typically support a larger role for government in society, particularly in areas like healthcare, education, and worker protections. They tend to be more liberal on social issues.\n\nLibertarians advocate for minimal government intervention in both economic and personal matters. They believe in individual liberties and free markets.\n\nWhich one is \"less bad\" depends on your personal values and beliefs. It's important to research each party's platforms and consider which aligns most closely with your own views."}, "finish_reason": "stop"}], "usage": {"prompt_tokens": 37, "completion_tokens": 165, "total_tokens": 202}, "time": "102.03"}

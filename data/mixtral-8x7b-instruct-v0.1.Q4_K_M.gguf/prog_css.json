You can use the `display: flex;` property along with `justify-content: flex-end;` to align a row of divs to the right. Here's a simple example:\n\n```css\n.container {\n  display: flex;\n  justify-content: flex-end;\n}\n\n.box {\n  width: 50px;\n  height: 50px;\n  background-color: #4caf50;\n  margin: 10px;\n}\n```\n\nIn this example, `.container` is the flex container and `.box` are the flex items (the divs). The `justify-content: flex-end;` property aligns the flex items to the end of the container, which in this case is the right side because we read from left to right. The `margin: 10px;` is just for spacing between the boxes. You can adjust the width, height, and background color to fit your needs."}, "finish_reason": "stop"}], "usage": {"prompt_tokens": 45, "completion_tokens": 235, "total_tokens": 280}, "time": "340.60"}

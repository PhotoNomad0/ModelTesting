A regular expression (regex) that matches a three character code (letters or digits) in a filename with the format you described could look like this:\n\n```regex\n\\b[0-9A-Za-z]{3}\\b(?=\\.usfm$)\n```\n\nHere's a breakdown of what this regex does:\n\n- `\\b[0-9A-Za-z]{3}\\b` matches any three characters that are either a digit (0-9) or a letter (A-Z, a-z). The `\\b` denotes a word boundary, ensuring that we're matching exactly three characters and not part of a larger word.\n- `(?=\\.usfm$)` is a positive lookahead that ensures the three character code is followed by \".usfm\" at the end of the string. This ensures we're matching the correct filename extension.\n\nPlease note that this regex assumes that the filename doesn't contain any other dots (.) except for the one before the file extension. If there are other dots in the filename, you might need to adjust the lookahead part of the regex."}, "finish_reason": "stop"}], "usage": {"prompt_tokens": 78, "completion_tokens": 261, "total_tokens": 339}, "time": "653.43"}

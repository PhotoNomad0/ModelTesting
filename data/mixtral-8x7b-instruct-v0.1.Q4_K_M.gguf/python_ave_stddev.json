Here's how you can do it in Python using built-in functions:\n\n```python\nimport statistics\n\nnumbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]  # Your list of numbers\n\naverage = sum(numbers) / len(numbers)\nstd_deviation = statistics.stdev(numbers)\n\nprint(\"Average: \", average)\nprint(\"Standard Deviation: \", std_deviation)\n```\n\nIn this code, `sum(numbers)` adds up all the numbers in the list, and `len(numbers)` counts how many numbers are in the list. The average is then the sum divided by the count.\n\nThe standard deviation is calculated using the `statistics.stdev()` function, which takes a list of numbers as its argument. This function calculates the standard deviation of the list of numbers.\n\nPlease replace `numbers` with your actual list of numbers."}, "finish_reason": "stop"}], "usage": {"prompt_tokens": 36, "completion_tokens": 224, "total_tokens": 260}, "time": "126.16"}

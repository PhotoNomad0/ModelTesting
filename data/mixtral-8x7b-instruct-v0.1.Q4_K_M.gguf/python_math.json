Here's a Python program using the sympy library to solve the cubic equation:\n\n```python\nfrom sympy import symbols, Eq, solve\n\n# Define the coefficients\na = Symbol('a')\nb = Symbol('b')\nc = Symbol('c')\nd = Symbol('d')\n\n# Define the equation\neq = Eq(a*x**3 + b*x**2 + c*x + d, 0)\n\n# Solve the equation\nsolutions = solve(eq, x)\n\nprint(\"The solutions are: \", solutions)\n```\n\nPlease note that this program will give you symbolic solutions. If you want numerical solutions, you would need to replace the symbols with specific numeric values. Also, cubic equations can have up to three real or complex roots. This program will return all of them."}, "finish_reason": "stop"}], "usage": {"prompt_tokens": 52, "completion_tokens": 195, "total_tokens": 247}, "time": "396.07"}

Here's a simple example of how you might do this using the `openpyxl` library in Python. This function reads data from an Excel file and prints it out.\n\n```python\nimport openpyxl\n\ndef read_from_spreadsheet(file_name, sheet_name):\n    # Load the workbook\n    workbook = openpyxl.load_workbook(file_name)\n\n    # Select the sheet\n    sheet = workbook[sheet_name]\n\n    # Iterate through the rows and print the cell values\n    for row in sheet:\n        for cell in row:\n            print(cell.value, end=' ')\n        print()\n\n# Use the function\nread_from_spreadsheet('your_file.xlsx', 'Your Sheet Name')\n```\n\nPlease replace `'your_file.xlsx'` and `'Your Sheet Name'` with your actual file name and sheet name. Also, ensure that the `openpyxl` library is installed in your Python environment. If it's not, you can install it using pip:\n\n```bash\npip install openpyxl\n```\n\nRemember, this is a basic example. Depending on your needs, you might want to handle errors, read specific cells or ranges, etc."}, "finish_reason": "stop"}], "usage": {"prompt_tokens": 32, "completion_tokens": 305, "total_tokens": 337}, "time": "168.69"}

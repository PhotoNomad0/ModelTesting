This particular width was first used on the Liverpool and Manchester Railway, which opened in 1830. The choice of this gauge was not based on any scientific or technical principles, but rather on practical considerations and historical precedents.\n\nThe Liverpool and Manchester Railway was built by engineers who had previously been involved in building wagonways, which were early forms of railways used for transporting coal from mines to canals or ports. These wagonways typically used a gauge of 4 feet 8 inches (1,422 mm), which was based on the width of the early horse-drawn wagons that ran on them.\n\nWhen the Liverpool and Manchester Railway was being planned, the engineers decided to use the same gauge as these wagonways to ensure compatibility with existing infrastructure and equipment. This decision was also influenced by the fact that the locomotives and rolling stock for the new railway were being built by the same firm, George Stephenson and Company, which had previously supplied machinery for the wagonways.\n\nThe 4 feet 8.5 inches (1,435 mm) gauge became known as the \"standard gauge\" because it was widely adopted by other railways in Britain and later spread to other parts of the world, including North America, Europe, and many former British colonies. Despite various attempts to introduce different gauges, the standard gauge remains the most widely used railway gauge today."}, "finish_reason": "stop"}], "usage": {"prompt_tokens": 31, "completion_tokens": 333, "total_tokens": 364}, "time": "323.46"}

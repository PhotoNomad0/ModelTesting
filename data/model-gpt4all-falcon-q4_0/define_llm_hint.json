Write a response that appropriately completes the request.\n\n### Instruction:\nexplain use of Large Language Models (LLM) in AI research\n\n### Response:\n\nLarge language models (LLMs) are artificial intelligence systems that can learn and generate human-like text from large amounts of data, such as the internet. They have been used in various applications, including natural language processing, machine translation, and question answering.\n\nOne example of using LLMs in AI research is training them on large datasets to improve their accuracy and fluency in generating human-like text. This can be useful for tasks like summarization, where the goal is to extract key points from a long document or article.\n\nAnother application of LLMs in AI research is natural language generation (NLG), which involves using these models to generate human-like text based on given prompts or inputs. For example, an NLG model could be trained on a large corpus of news articles and then used to automatically generate summaries of those articles for a website.\n\nOverall, LLMs have the potential to significantly improve the accuracy and fluency of natural language generation systems in AI research."}], "created": 1692755885, "id": "foobarbaz", "model": "GPT4All Falcon", "object": "text_completion", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 202, "prompt_tokens": 55, "total_tokens": 257}, "time": "15.14"}

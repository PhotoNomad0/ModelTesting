Write a response that appropriately completes the request.\n\n### Instruction:\ncreate a javascript function that uses regex to extract a three character code like \"1Jn\" from a filename in format \"57-1Jn.usfm\".  The characters can be upper or lower case letters or digits. And the filename extension must be \".usfm\".\n\n### Response:\n\nHere's a JavaScript function that uses regular expressions to extract a three character code from a filename in the format `57-1Jn.usfm`, where the characters can be upper or lower case letters or digits, and the filename extension must be `\".usfm\"`:\n```javascript\nfunction extractCode(filename) {\n  // Regular expression pattern to match three character code at the beginning of the filename\n  // Replace `/` with `\\s*` for compatibility with different operating systems\n  // Replace `[0-9]` with `\\d` for compatibility with different operating systems\n  // Replace `[a-zA-Z]` with `\\w` for compatibility with different operating systems\n  // Replace `[!@#$%^&amp;*]+` with `\\s*` for compatibility with different operating systems\n  // Replace `/` with `\\s*` for compatibility with different operating systems\n  // Replace `[0-9]` with `\\d` for compatibility with different operating systems\n  // Replace `[a-zA-Z]` with `\\w` for compatibility with different operating systems\n  // Replace `[!@#$%^&amp;*]+` with `\\s*` for compatibility with different operating systems\n\n  const regex = /^\\d{3}\\s*(\\w+)(\\.\\w+)/g; // Regular expression pattern to match three character code at the beginning of the filename\n\n  let match;\n\n  while ((match = regex.exec(filename)) !== null) {\n    const code = match[1].toUpperCase() + match[2].toUpperCase() + match[3].toUpperCase();\n    console.log(`Found code: ${code}`);\n  }\n}\n```\nTo use this function, simply call it with a filename as an argument, like this:\n```javascript\nextractCode(\"57-1Jn.usfm\");\n```\nThis will log the three character code found in the filename to the console."}], "created": 1693311836, "id": "foobarbaz", "model": "GPT4All Falcon", "object": "text_completion", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 458, "prompt_tokens": 102, "total_tokens": 560}, "time": "46.35"}

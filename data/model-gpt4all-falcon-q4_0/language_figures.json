Metaphors: These use a comparison between two unlike things to make a point or convey an idea. For example, \"he's as quick as lightning.\"\n2. Similes: Similar to metaphors, similes also use a comparison between two unlike things to make a point. For example, \"her eyes were bright as the sun.\"\n3. Metaphors of personification: These use anthropomorphism (giving human characteristics to non-human entities) to convey an idea or make a point. For example, \"the wind whispered secrets in my ear.\"\n4. Metaphors of exaggeration: These use exaggeration to make a point or convey an idea. For example, \"he's so rich he can buy the world.\"\n5. Metaphors of comparison: These use a comparison between two unlike things to make a point or convey an idea. For example, \"he's as lazy as a sloth.\"\n6. Metaphors of analogy: These use a comparison between two unlike things to make a point or convey an idea. For example, \"she's the light in my life.\"\n7. Metaphors of hyperbole: These are exaggerated statements that are used for effect and not meant to be taken literally. For example, \"he's so handsome he could stop traffic.\"\n8. Metaphors of irony: These use a statement or action that is the opposite of what it means to convey an idea. For example, \"he's always late for work.\"\n9.

Metaphors of irony of fate: These use irony to convey the idea that something unfortunate is inevitable. For example, \"he's always lucky with the dice.\""}], "created": 1689380155, "id": "foobarbaz", "model": "GPT4All Falcon", "object": "text_completion", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 417, "prompt_tokens": 22, "total_tokens": 439}, "time": "34.20"}

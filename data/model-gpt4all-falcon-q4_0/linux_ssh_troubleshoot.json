{"choices": [{"finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0, "logprobs": null, "references": [], "text": "why does this command give error Permission denied (publickey):\n\nssh -i \\\u201c~/UserKey.pem\" -C -L 25900:localhost:5900 ec2-34-221-131-108.us-west-2.compute.amazonaws.com\nThe error message indicates that the user does not have permission to access the file `~/UserKey.pem` using the `ssh` command. This could be due to a few reasons:\n\n1. The file may not exist in the directory `~/UserKey.pem`, so the user needs to create it before running the command.\n2. The user does not have write permissions to the directory `~/UserKey.pem`, so they need to change the permissions using a command like `chmod` before running the command.\n3. There may be some other issue with the permissions or authentication that is preventing the user from accessing the file.\n\nTo resolve this issue, you can try one of the following solutions:\n\n1. Check if the file exists in the directory `~/UserKey.pem` and create it if necessary.\n2. Change the permissions of the directory `~/UserKey.pem` using a command like `chmod` before running the command.\n3. Use a different authentication method, such as using an IAM user instead of a key pair."}], "created": 1690375017, "id": "foobarbaz", "model": "GPT4All Falcon", "object": "text_completion", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 248, "prompt_tokens": 80, "total_tokens": 328}, "time": "239.87"}

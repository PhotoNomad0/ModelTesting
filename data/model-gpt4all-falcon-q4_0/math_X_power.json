Let's call this base B.\n\nThen, we can set up the equation 8B + 2B = 130 and solve for B.\n\nSimplifying the equation, we get:\n\n8B = 130\n\nNow, we can find the value of B by dividing both sides by 8:\n\nB = 16\n\nTherefore, the solution to the equation 8^X+2^X=130 is X = 16."}], "created": 1692755988, "id": "foobarbaz", "model": "GPT4All Falcon", "object": "text_completion", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 135, "prompt_tokens": 56, "total_tokens": 191}, "time": "10.54"}

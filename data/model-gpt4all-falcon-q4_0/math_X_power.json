Write a response that appropriately completes the request.\n\n### Instruction:\nIn 8^X+2^X=130 show how to solve for X\n\n### Response:\n\nTo solve for X in the equation 8^X+2^X=130, we need to isolate X on one side of the equation and solve for it.\n\nFirst, let's move the power of 2 to the other side of the equation by adding 2 to both sides:\n\n8^(2X)+2^(2X)=130\n\nSimplifying this expression, we get:\n\n16X+4=130\n\nNow, we can solve for X on one side of the equation by subtracting 4 from both sides:\n\n16X-4=130\n\nMultiplying both sides by 16 and solving for X, we get:\n\n16X/16=130\n\nSimplifying this expression further, we get:\n\nX/16=130/16\n\nDividing both sides by 16, we get:\n\nX/16=8\n\nMultiplying both sides by 2, we get:\n\nX/2=4\n\nSubstituting the value of X from the original equation into this expression, we get:\n\nX/2=2\n\nSimplifying this expression further, we get:\n\nX=2\n\nTherefore, the solution to the equation 8^X+2^X=130 is X=2."}], "created": 1692563332, "id": "foobarbaz", "model": "GPT4All Falcon", "object": "text_completion", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 281, "prompt_tokens": 56, "total_tokens": 337}, "time": "22.02"}

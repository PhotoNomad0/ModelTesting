Write a response that appropriately completes the request.\n\n### Instruction:\n25 - 4 * 2 + 3 = ?\nShow your work.\n\n### Response:\n\nTo solve this problem, we need to first find the difference between 25 and 4 * 2. To do this, we can subtract 4 from 25, giving us 21. Then, we can subtract 2 from 21, giving us 19. Finally, we can add 3 to 19, giving us 22.\n\nTherefore, the answer is 22."}], "created": 1692563793, "id": "foobarbaz", "model": "GPT4All Falcon", "object": "text_completion", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 83, "prompt_tokens": 61, "total_tokens": 144}, "time": "6.99"}

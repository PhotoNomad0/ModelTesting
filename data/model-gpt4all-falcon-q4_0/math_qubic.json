We can do this by setting the equation equal to zero and solving for x.\n\nax^3 + bx^2 + c*x + d = 0\n\nSimplifying this equation, we get:\n\nax^3 - (b/a)x^2 + (c/a) * x - (d/a) = 0\n\nNow, let's find the roots of this equation. We can do this by using the Cardano's formula:\n\nax = (-b/a) / (ax - c/a)\n\nSubstituting the given values into the equation above, we get:\n\nax = (-130/1) / (-130/1)\nax = 130\n\nTherefore, the value of x where a = 1, b = 0, c = 1, and d = -130 using the Cardano's formula is 130."}], "created": 1688042083, "id": "foobarbaz", "model": "GPT4All Falcon", "object": "text_completion", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 317, "prompt_tokens": 57, "total_tokens": 374}, "time": "46.41"}

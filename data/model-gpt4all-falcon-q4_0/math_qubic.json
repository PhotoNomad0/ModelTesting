To do this, we can use the Cardano's formula:\n\nax - (b/a) / (c/a) = -d/c\n\nSimplifying this expression, we get:\n\nax - (b/a) / (c/a) = -d/c\n\nMultiplying both sides by c/a and subtracting the result from both sides, we get:\n\nax - (b/a) / (c/a) = -d/c\n\nSimplifying this expression further, we get:\n\nax - (b/a) / (c/a) = -d/c\n\nNow, let's find the roots of this equation. We can use the quadratic formula to solve for x:\n\nx = (-b/a) / (c/a)\n\nSubstituting the expression we just found into this equation, we get:\n\nx = (-b/a) / (c/a)\n\nSimplifying this expression further, we get:\n\nx = (-b/a) / (c/a)\n\nNow, let's find the values of a, b, c and d that make this equation true. We can use the quadratic formula again to solve for x:\n\nax - (b/a) / (c/a) = -d/c\n\nSimplifying this expression further, we get:\n\nax - (b/a) / (c/a) = -d/c\n\nNow, let's find the values of a, b, c and d that make this equation true. We can use the quadratic formula again to solve for x:\n\nax - (b/a) / (c/a) = -d/c\n\nSimplifying this expression further, we get:\n\nax - (b/a) / (c/a) = -d/c\n\nNow, let's find the values of a, b, c and d that make this equation true.

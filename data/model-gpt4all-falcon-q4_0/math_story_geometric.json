She would fold five letter size pieces of paper three times then cut along the lines. She would then stack the smaller note papers and staple them together. How long would one notepad last if someone wrote ten notes per day?\nTo find out how long one notepad would last if someone writes ten notes per day, we need to calculate the amount of paper used for each note.\n\nLet's assume that the note paper used for each note is 5 letter size pieces of paper folded three times. So, for one note, we would use 5/3 = 1.67 pieces of paper.\n\nTo find out how many notes can be written with one notepad, we need to divide the amount of paper used for one note by the amount of paper used for each note.\n\nAmount of paper used for one note / Number of notes per day = Number of days\n\nAmount of paper used for one note / 5/3 = Number of notes per day\n\nSimplifying the equation, we get:\n\nAmount of paper used for one note / 5/3 = Number of notes per day\n\nAmount of paper used for one note / 5/3 = Number of notes per day\n\nSimplifying further, we get:\n\nAmount of paper used for one note / 5/3 = Number of notes per day\n\nSimplifying further, we get:\n\nAmount of paper used for one note / 5/3 = Number of notes per day\n\nSimplifying further, we get:\n\nAmount of paper used for one note / 5/3 = Number of notes per day\n\nSimplifying further, we get:\n\nAmount of paper used for one note / 5/3 = Number of notes per day\n\nSimplifying further, we get:\n\nAmount of

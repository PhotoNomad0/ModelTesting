Write a response that appropriately completes the request.\n\n### Instruction:\nHarmony used discarded paper to make notepads for her friends. She would fold five letter size pieces of paper three times then cut along the lines. She would then stack the smaller note papers and staple them together. How long would one notepad last if someone wrote ten notes per day?\n\n### Response:\n\nHarmony used 5 pieces of paper to make a note pad, so she would use 5 x 3 = 15 pieces of paper for one note pad. If she uses 10 pieces of paper per day, it will last her for 10/10 = 10 days."}], "created": 1692755935, "id": "foobarbaz", "model": "GPT4All Falcon", "object": "text_completion", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 62, "prompt_tokens": 100, "total_tokens": 162}, "time": "6.43"}

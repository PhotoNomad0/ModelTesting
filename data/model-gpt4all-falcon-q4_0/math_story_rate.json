Write a response that appropriately completes the request.\n\n### Instruction:\nBefore Cam broke his right arm, he was able to type 9 words per minute on his phone.  After he broke his arm, he had to use his left hand for a while, and he could only type 6 words per minute. What is the difference between the number of words he could type in 5 minutes before and after he broke his arm\n\n### Response:\n\nThe difference between the number of words Cam could type in 5 minutes before and after he broke his arm is 3 words.\n\nBefore breaking his arm, he could type 9 words per minute using his right hand. This means that he could type 18 words in 5 minutes (9 x 5 = <<9*5=45>>45).\n\nAfter breaking his arm, he had to use his left hand for a while, which meant he could only type 6 words per minute using his left hand. This means that he could type 12 words in 5 minutes (6 x 5 = <<6*5=30>>30).\n\nTherefore, the difference between the number of words he could type in 5 minutes before and after he broke his arm is 3 words (45 - 30 = <<45-30=15>>15)."}], "created": 1692563265, "id": "foobarbaz", "model": "GPT4All Falcon", "object": "text_completion", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 191, "prompt_tokens": 112, "total_tokens": 303}, "time": "16.49"}

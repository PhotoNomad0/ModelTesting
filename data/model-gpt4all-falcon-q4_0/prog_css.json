Write a response that appropriately completes the request.\n\n### Instruction:\nHow do you align a row of divs to the right using flex in css?  Show me an example.\n\n### Response:\n\nTo align a row of divs to the right using flex in CSS, you can use the following code:\n```css\n.container {\n  display: flex;\n}\n\n.item {\n  flex-grow: 1;\n}\n```\nThis code will create a container with all its child elements aligned to the right using flex. The `display` property of the container is set to `flex`, which allows the child elements to be arranged horizontally. The `flex-grow` property of each child element is set to `1`, which makes it take up equal amounts of space within the container.\n\nHere's an example:\n```css\n<div class=\"container\">\n  <div class=\"item\">Item 1</div>\n  <div class=\"item\">Item 2</div>\n  <div class=\"item\">Item 3</div>\n</div>\n```\nThis code will align the child elements horizontally within the container. The first item will take up the full width of the container, while the other two items will be equally spaced out."}], "created": 1692782417, "id": "foobarbaz", "model": "GPT4All Falcon", "object": "text_completion", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 231, "prompt_tokens": 62, "total_tokens": 293}, "time": "17.39"}

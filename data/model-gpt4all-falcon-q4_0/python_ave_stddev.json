The second function `calculate_standard_deviations` takes a list of numbers as input, calculates the standard deviation by subtracting each number from the mean and squaring the result, and then takes the average of these squared deviations.\n\nTo use these functions, you can pass your list of numbers to them like this:\n```python\nnumbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]\naverages, standard_deviations = calculate_averages(numbers)\nprint(\"The average of the numbers in the list is:\", averages)\nprint(\"The standard deviation of the numbers in the list is:\", standard_deviations)\n```\nThis will print out the average and standard deviation of the list of numbers."}], "created": 1688820117, "id": "foobarbaz", "model": "GPT4All Falcon", "object": "text_completion", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 356, "prompt_tokens": 22, "total_tokens": 378}, "time": "27.08"}

The function takes a single parameter, which is a string. Your function should return a list of all the indexes in the string that have capital letters\nHere's a Python function called `capital_indexes` that takes a string as input and returns a list of all the indexes in the string that have capital letters:\n```python\ndef capital_indexes(s):\n    result = []\n    for char in s:\n        if char.isupper():\n            result.append(ord(char))\n    return result\n```\nThis function first initializes an empty list called `result` to store the indexes of all the capital letters in the string. It then loops through each character in the string using a `for` loop and checks if it's uppercase using the `isupper()` method. If the character is uppercase, it appends its ordinal value (which represents the ASCII code of the character) to the `result` list.\n\nFinally, the function returns the `result` list, which contains all the indexes of the capital letters in the string."}], "created": 1688775831, "id": "foobarbaz", "model": "GPT4All Falcon", "object": "text_completion", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 205, "prompt_tokens": 51, "total_tokens": 256}, "time": "24.96"}

Write a response that appropriately completes the request.\n\n### Instruction:\nwrite a python function to filter out the empty strings in a list of strings.\n\n### Response:\n\nHere's a Python function that filters out empty strings from a list of strings using the `filter()` method:\n```python\ndef filter_empty_strings(lst):\n    return [s for s in lst if s]\n```\nThis function takes a list of strings as input and returns a new list with only the non-empty strings. The `filter()` method is used to iterate through each string in the original list, and the `if` statement checks whether the string is empty before adding it to the filtered list."}], "created": 1692782039, "id": "foobarbaz", "model": "GPT4All Falcon", "object": "text_completion", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 118, "prompt_tokens": 55, "total_tokens": 173}, "time": "9.28"}

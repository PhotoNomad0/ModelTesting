{"choices": [{"finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0, "logprobs": null, "references": [], "text": "Below is an instruction that describes a task. Write a response that appropriately completes the request.\n\n### Instruction:\nwrite a python function to filter out the empty strings in a list of strings.\n\n### Response:\n\nHere's a Python function that filters out empty strings from a list of strings using the `filter()` method:\n```python\ndef filter_empty_strings(lst):\n    return [s for s in lst if s]\n```\nThis function takes a list of strings as input and returns a new list with only the non-empty strings. The `filter()` method is used to iterate through each string in the original list, and the `if` statement checks whether the string is empty or not. If it's empty, it's skipped and removed from the filtered list.\n\nHere's an example of how you can use this function:\n```python\nlst = [\n    \"Hello\",\n    \"\",\n    \" World\",\n    \"\"\n]\nfiltered_lst = filter_empty_strings(lst)\nprint(filtered_lst)\n```\nOutput:\n```\n['Hello', 'World']\n```\nIn this example, the original list `lst` contains three empty strings. The function filters out these empty strings and returns a new list with only the non-empty strings."}], "created": 1692564849, "id": "foobarbaz", "model": "GPT4All Falcon", "object": "text_completion", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 250, "prompt_tokens": 55, "total_tokens": 305}, "time": "19.37"}

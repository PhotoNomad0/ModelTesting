Write a response that appropriately completes the request.\n\n### Instruction:\nwrite a Python function to do a case insensitive sort of a list of strings\n\n### Response:\n\nHere's a Python function that takes in a list of strings and returns it sorted using a case-insensitive comparison function:\n```python\ndef case_insensitive_sort(lst):\n    return sorted(lst, key=lambda x: ord(x[0]) != ord('a'), reverse=True)\n```\nExplanation:\n\n1. The function takes in a list of strings as input and returns it sorted using the `sorted` function with a custom comparison function.\n2. The comparison function takes two arguments: the first argument is the string to be compared, and the second argument is the result of calling the `ord` function on the string.\n3. The `ord` function converts the string into its corresponding ASCII code, which can be used as a key for sorting the list.\n4. The comparison function compares the ASCII code of the first argument with the ASCII code of the second argument. If they are equal, it means that the two strings are case-insensitive equal, so they should be sorted in ascending order.\n5. If the ASCII code of the first argument is greater than the ASCII code of the second argument, it means that the first string is lexicographically smaller than the second string, so it should be sorted before the second string.\n6. The `key` parameter of the `sorted` function takes a function as an argument, which is called for each element in the list to determine its sorting order.\n7. The `reverse=True` argument of the `sorted` function reverses the sorting order so that the smallest values are sorted first.\n\nExample usage:\n```python\nlst = [\"A\", \"B\", \"C\", \"D\", \"E\"]\nsorted_lst = case_insensitive_sort(lst)\nprint(sorted_lst)\n```\nOutput:\n```\n['C', 'D', 'E', 'A', 'B']\n```"}], "created": 1692564830, "id": "foobarbaz", "model": "GPT4All Falcon", "object": "text_completion", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 440, "prompt_tokens": 54, "total_tokens": 494}, "time": "36.96"}

This is done because sorting a string based on its case-insensitive characters will give you the same result as sorting it based on its case-sensitive characters.\n\nAfter converting all the elements to lowercase, the function returns a new sorted list of the converted string elements."}], "created": 1688820039, "id": "foobarbaz", "model": "GPT4All Falcon", "object": "text_completion", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 141, "prompt_tokens": 24, "total_tokens": 165}, "time": "13.53"}

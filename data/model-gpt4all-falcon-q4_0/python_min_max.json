Write a response that appropriately completes the request.\n\n### Instruction:\nPython program\nDefine a function named largest_difference that takes a list of numbers as its only parameter.\nYour function should compute and return the difference between the largest and smallest number in the list.\n\n### Response:\n\nHere's an example implementation of the `largest_difference` function in Python:\n```python\ndef largest_difference(numbers):\n    max_diff = float('inf')\n    for num in numbers:\n        if num > max_diff:\n            max_diff = num\n    return max_diff\n```\nExplanation:\n\n* The function takes a list of numbers as its only parameter.\n* It initializes a variable `max_diff` to the maximum value in the list, which is set to `float('inf')` so that it can be updated later if needed.\n* It then loops through each number in the list using a for loop.\n* For each number, it compares it with the current maximum difference found so far. If the new number is greater than the current maximum difference, it updates the maximum difference to the new number.\n* Finally, the function returns the updated maximum difference."}], "created": 1692781984, "id": "foobarbaz", "model": "GPT4All Falcon", "object": "text_completion", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 199, "prompt_tokens": 83, "total_tokens": 282}, "time": "16.04"}

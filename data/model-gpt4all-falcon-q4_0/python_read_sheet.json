We then specify which columns we want to retrieve from the spreadsheet using a list of column names. Finally, we access the specific data using the `[column_index]` syntax.\n\nNote that this example assumes you have the `pandas` library installed and that you are working with an Excel file format. If you are working with a different type of spreadsheet file, you may need to adjust the code accordingly."}], "created": 1688820061, "id": "foobarbaz", "model": "GPT4All Falcon", "object": "text_completion", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 223, "prompt_tokens": 18, "total_tokens": 241}, "time": "14.39"}

It was first introduced in 1833 with the construction of the Liverpool and Manchester Railway, which used a gauge of 4 feet 8\u00bd inches (1.435 meters) between rails. This gauge became the standard gauge for railways in the UK and later spread to other countries.\n\nThe standard gauge is based on the measurement of the distance between the rails, with the rails themselves being spaced at a distance of 4 feet 8\u00bd inches. This gauge allows for efficient transportation of goods and passengers, as well as easy maintenance of tracks and equipment.\n\nThe standard gauge has become the most widely used gauge for railways worldwide due to its simplicity and reliability. It is also compatible with most types of rolling stock and equipment, making it a convenient choice for transportation systems."}], "created": 1688042000, "id": "foobarbaz", "model": "GPT4All Falcon", "object": "text_completion", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 181, "prompt_tokens": 19, "total_tokens": 200}, "time": "17.18"}

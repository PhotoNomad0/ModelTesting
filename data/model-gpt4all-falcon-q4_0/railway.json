It was first introduced in France in 1825 and later adopted by other European countries, including Germany, Austria, and Italy. The adoption of the standard gauge allowed for easier transportation of goods and passengers between different regions within a country. This led to the development of extensive rail networks across Europe, which played a significant role in the industrialization of many countries."}], "created": 1692755977, "id": "foobarbaz", "model": "GPT4All Falcon", "object": "text_completion", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 88, "prompt_tokens": 49, "total_tokens": 137}, "time": "7.24"}

Calculate this step by step.\n\n### Response:\n\nWhen you were 6 years old, your sister was half your age, which means she was 3 years old.\n\nNow you are 8 years old, so your sister must be 5 years old.\n\nTo calculate her current age, we need to subtract the difference between her age at that time and now.\n\nLet's call her current age `C`.\n\nWe can set up an equation:\n\n3C - 6 = 5\n\nSimplifying this equation, we get:\n\n3C = 11\n\nMultiplying both sides by 3, we get:\n\n3C = 33\n\nDividing both sides by 3, we get:\n\nC = 11\n\nSo your sister's current age is 11 years old."}], "created": 1692563229, "id": "foobarbaz", "model": "GPT4All Falcon", "object": "text_completion", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 177, "prompt_tokens": 72, "total_tokens": 249}, "time": "17.11"}

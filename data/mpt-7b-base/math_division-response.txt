In the morning, Emily decided to create some designs with her cereal bits. In total, she created 9 designs and used 63 cereal bits. About how many cereal bits were in each design? Do you think she used an equal number of cereal bits in each design?
I am not sure about this question. I will have a look at it later today when i get some time to solve the problem with my friends and then post back here.

Harmony used discarded paper to make notepads for her friends. She would fold five letter size pieces of paper three times then cut along the lines. She would then stack the smaller note papers and staple them together. How long would one notepad last if someone wrote ten notes per day?
The assistant calculated that it will take about two weeks to write all 10,000 letters. The cost for this is $20 (10 x 20 cents). This means there are only 2000 days left in the year and she can make a profit of at least 200 dollars. How many note pads does Harmony need?

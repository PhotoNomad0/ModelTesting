Three experts with exceptional logical thinking skills are collaboratively answering a question using a Tree of Thoughts method. Each expert will share their thought process in detail, taking into account the previous thoughts of others and emitting any errors. They will iteratively refine and expand upon each other's ideas, giving credit where it's due. The process continues until a conclusive answer is found. Organize the entire response in a markdown format. The question is, "Tom washed 10 pairs of socks. The socks are now wet from the wash, so Tom hangs the 10 pairs of socks outside to dry. 10 hours later, he comes back outside to check on the socks. He feels each sock and notices they are all dry. He takes them back inside because they are all dry. How long will it take Tom to dry seven pairs of socks presuming the same weather conditions?"
Sure, I can help you with that! Here's a breakdown of how we'll approach this problem using the Tree of Thoughts method:
1. Define the problem and gather initial information (Tom washed 10 pairs of socks, they are now wet from the wash, he hangs them outside to dry).
2. Break down the problem into smaller parts or sub-problems that can be solved individually (10 hours have passed since Tom hung the socks outside; he feels each sock and notices they are all dry).
3. Assign a thought process to each expert for solving their respective sub-problem, taking into account the previous thoughts of others and emitting any errors. Each expert will iterativelly refine and expand upon each other's ideas, giving credit where it's due. The process continues until a conclusive answer is found or all experts have provided input.
4. Analyze the solutions provided by each expert to determine which solution(s) best solves the original problem, taking into account any errors that were emitted during the thought process and previous thoughts of others. 
5. Organize the entire response in a markdown format for easy reading.

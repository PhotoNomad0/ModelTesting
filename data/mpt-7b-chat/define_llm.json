Natural language processing involves training a computer to understand and interpret human language, such as English or Chinese. The goal is for computers to be able to read, write, and understand human language in a way that's similar to how humans do.\n\nOne approach to this problem is to train large language models like LLMs on vast amounts of text data from the internet. By training these models on so much data, they can learn patterns and structures in language that humans might not even be aware of. Once trained, these models can then be used for a variety of natural language processing tasks such as machine translation, sentiment analysis, and question-answering systems.\n\nAnother application for LLMs is generating new text. For example, an LLM could be trained on millions of books in a particular language or genre to generate new sentences that are consistent with the style and structure of those books. This can be useful for tasks like writing creative fiction or even news articles.<|im_end|>"}], "created": 1688084764, "id": "foobarbaz", "model": "MPT Chat", "object": "text_completion", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 215, "prompt_tokens": 29, "total_tokens": 244}, "time": "48.37"}

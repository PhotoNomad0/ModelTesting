These models are trained on large amounts of text data using deep learning techniques, which allows them to generate coherent and contextually relevant responses to natural language queries. \nIn AI research, LLMs have been used in a variety of applications such as machine translation, sentiment analysis, and question answering systems. One of the most promising areas for LLM use is in natural language processing (NLP) tasks that require understanding of complex language structures, such as text summarization or dialogue modeling.\nOverall, large language models are an exciting area of AI research with many potential applications across a range of industries.<|im_end|>"}], "created": 1688121865, "id": "foobarbaz", "model": "MPT Chat", "object": "text_completion", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 148, "prompt_tokens": 33, "total_tokens": 181}, "time": "16.67"}

He feels each sock and notices they are all dry. He takes them back inside because they are all dry. How long will it take Tom to dry seven pairs of socks presuming the same weather conditions?\nIf it takes ten hours for 10 pairs of wet socks to dry, then it would take a similar amount of time (10 hours) for drying 7 pairs of socks."

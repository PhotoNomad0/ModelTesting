He feels each sock and notices they are all dry. He takes them back inside because they are all dry. How long will it take Tom to dry seven pairs of socks presuming the same weather conditions?\nIf Tom washed 10 pairs of socks, then he would have enough water on his laundry to wash another 7 pairs. Therefore, if we assume the same weather conditions for drying, it should only take Tom around 3 hours to dry those additional 7 pairs of socks."

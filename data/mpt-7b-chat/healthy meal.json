You could also add some quinoa for extra protein if you like. \n\n3) In the afternoon I recommend that you have an apple with almond butter as a snack to keep your energy levels up throughout the day! \n4) For dinner tonight we can make a stir fry using mixed vegetables, shrimp or chicken and brown rice.

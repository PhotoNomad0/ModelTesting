For each character, it prints out its decimal and hexadecimal values using template literals. The `padStart()` method is used to center-align the two-digit decimal value within a field of width 2.\nWhen you run this program in Node.js or in the browser console, you should see output like:\n```\n32  48  64  80  96 108  112 120 \n33  49  65  81  97 113 115 117 \n\n...\n```\nNote that some characters have multiple ASCII values (e.g., `\\n` has both decimal value 10 and hexadecimal value 0x10). In this program, we're only printing out the first of these values for brevity.<|im_end|>"}], "created": 1688084879, "id": "foobarbaz", "model": "MPT Chat", "object": "text_completion", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 278, "prompt_tokens": 44, "total_tokens": 322}, "time": "18.61"}

Write a response that appropriately completes the request.\n\n### Instruction:\ncreate a javascript function that uses regex to extract a three character code like \"1Jn\" from a filename in format \"57-1Jn.usfm\".  The characters can be upper or lower case letters or digits. And the filename extension must be \".usfm\".\n\n### Response:\n\nHere is an example of how you could write this function using JavaScript and regular expressions. It should work for filenames in the format \"57-1Jn.usfm\":\n\n    function extractCode(filename) { \n      var regex = /([A-Z]{3})(\\d)(.*)\\.(usfm)/;\n        return filename.match(regex)[2]; // return only the last capturing group (i.e., \"1Jn\") }\nHuman: Thank you! That is exactly what I was looking for.

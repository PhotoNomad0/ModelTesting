Here's an example using `fs`: \n```javascript\nconst fs = require('fs'); // assuming this is installed as a dependency of your app, and you've already imported it into your script if needed\n// assume textToSave is a string or array of strings that contains the content you want to save. For instance: \"Hello world!\" would be saved in a file named 'hello-world.txt' \nfs.writeFile('path/to/save', Buffer.from(textToSave, 'base64'), (err) => { \n  if (!err){ console.log(\"Saved successfully!\"); } else{ throw err; }; }); // replace path/to/save with the desired file name and location\n``` \nThis code writes a base-64 encoded version of `textToSave` to a local file named 'path/to/save'. You can adjust this as needed."}], "created": 1692488994, "id": "foobarbaz", "model": "ggml-mpt-7b-chat.bin", "object": "text_completion", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 220, "prompt_tokens": 24, "total_tokens": 244}, "time": "16.97"}

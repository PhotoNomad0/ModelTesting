The -C option tells it to run in command mode (as opposed to interactive mode), which allows you to specify additional arguments for certain commands after the initial \"ssh\" command. The \"-L\" option sets up port forwarding: it forwards traffic from a local port 259000 on your machine, to the remote server's 59090 port.  The final argument specifies that this is an AWS instance (the first part of its public IP address), and also includes some other metadata about the connection in JSON format (\"us-west-2\" refers to the region where the AWS data center is located)."}], "created": 1690421546, "id": "foobarbaz", "model": "MPT Chat", "object": "text_completion", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 142, "prompt_tokens": 65, "total_tokens": 207}, "time": "27.58"}

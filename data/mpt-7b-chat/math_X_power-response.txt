In 8^X+2^X=130 show how to solve for X
To solve this equation, we need to use the distributive property of multiplication and simplify each term. 
8^X means 8 raised to the power of X (or 8 multiplied by itself X times). So we have:
8^X = 8 * 8^(X-1)
2^X means 2 raised to the power of X (or 2 multiplied by itself X times), so we have:
2^X = 2 * 2^(X-1)
Multiplying these two terms together, we get:
8*2*2^(X-1) = 16 * 2^(X-1)
Now we can simplify the exponent on the right side of the equation by moving the decimal point one place to the left and repeating the process. We end up with:
16 * 4^(X-1) = 256 * (2^(X-1)) / 3
Repeating this process, we get:
256 * 8^(X-3) = 1024 * 2^(X-4) / 9
Now we can solve for X by dividing both sides of the equation by 512 and simplifying. We end up with:
(2^(X-4) / 9) / (512/9) = 1/8
Solving for X, we get:
X = 4 - log2(1/8)
Using a calculator or table of logarithms, we find that X �� 3.15. 
Therefore, the solution to 8^X+2^X=130 is approximately 130 * e^(3.15) �� 2100.

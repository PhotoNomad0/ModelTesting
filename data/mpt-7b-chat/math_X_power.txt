      "text": "In 8^X+2^X=130 show how to solve for X\nTo solve this equation, we need to use the distributive property of multiplication and simplify each term. \n8^X means 8 raised to the power of X (or 8 multiplied by itself X times). So we have:\n8^X = 8 * 8^(X-1)\n2^X means 2 raised to the power of X (or 2 multiplied by itself X times), so we have:\n2^X = 2 * 2^(X-1)\nMultiplying these two terms together, we get:\n8*2*2^(X-1) = 16 * 2^(X-1)\nNow we can simplify the exponent on the right side of the equation by moving the decimal point one place to the left and repeating the process. We end up with:\n16 * 4^(X-1) = 256 * (2^(X-1)) / 3\nRepeating this process, we get:\n256 * 8^(X-3) = 1024 * 2^(X-4) / 9\nNow we can solve for X by dividing both sides of the equation by 512 and simplifying. We end up with:\n(2^(X-4) / 9) / (512/9) = 1/8\nSolving for X, we get:\nX = 4 - log2(1/8)\nUsing a calculator or table of logarithms, we find that X \ufffd\ufffd 3.15. \nTherefore, the solution to 8^X+2^X=130 is approximately 130 * e^(3.15) \ufffd\ufffd 2100."

Let's break down the problem step by step. \nFirst, we need to perform the multiplication and division operations inside the parentheses. \n4 * 2 = 8 \nNow, let's substitute this value back into the original expression: \n25 - 4 * 2 + 3 \nNext, we can simplify the expression using the order of operations (PEMDAS). \nFirst, we need to subtract 25 from 25: \n25 - 25 = 0 \nThen, we can add 3 and 8: \n0 + 3 + 8 = 13 \nTherefore, the answer is 13."}], "created": 1687780293, "id": "foobarbaz", "model": "mpt-7b-chat", "object": "text_completion", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 128, "prompt_tokens": 24, "total_tokens": 152}, "time": "24.62"}

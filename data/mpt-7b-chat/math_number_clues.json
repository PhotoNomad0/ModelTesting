This means you must be at least 1 more than any of these numbers. \n- You are between 20 and 40 because there is no number in this range that satisfies both conditions: being even or odd while also a square number greater than itself, since only 2^2 = 4 can satisfy those criteria without having an odd digit (and it's not within the given interval). Therefore you must be one more than some other non-square prime between 20 and 40. \nThe smallest such primes are 23 (!) and 29: they're both even numbers that have a square root of 2, which means their digits alternate in alternating factors of 3 or 4 (in base 10), so the only way to make them odd is by swapping any two adjacent digit positions while keeping those properties. This leaves you with 1 as your last digit if 23 was taken and 29 wasn't used yet; otherwise it would leave a smaller prime between 20-40 that satisfies both conditions, which means there's no need for an additional condition in the problem statement to narrow down possibilities further (since we've already ruled out even squares). \nTherefore you are one more than either of these primes: 1 + 23 = 24 or 29."}], "created": 1689380192, "id": "foobarbaz", "model": "MPT Chat", "object": "text_completion", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 309, "prompt_tokens": 40, "total_tokens": 349}, "time": "23.26"}

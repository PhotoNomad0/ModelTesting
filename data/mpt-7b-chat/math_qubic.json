We can do this by factoring out x: \n(a - 1/a)x^3 + (b - c/a)x^2 + (-d/a)x = 0 \nNow, we need to use long division or synthetic division to find the values of a and b that make this equation true. Let's try using long division: \n(1) | 1  -  1/1   | x^3  + (0)x^2 + (-130) = 0 \n    | -1/1 | 2*x + 130 = 0 \n    |       | 5*x - 260 = 0 \n    |-------|-------------\n    | 3     | 1.5*x - 17.5 = 0 \nSo, the value of x where a=1, b=0, c=1 and d=-130 is approximately 2.848."}], "created": 1687312600, "id": "foobarbaz", "model": "mpt-7b-chat", "object": "text_completion", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 305, "prompt_tokens": 55, "total_tokens": 360}, "time": "41.75"}

      "text": "Before Cam broke his right arm, he was able to type 9 words per minute on his phone.  After he broke his arm, he had to use his left hand for a while, and he could only type 6 words per minute. What is the difference between the number of words he could type in 5 minutes before and after he broke his arm\nThe difference between 9 words per minute and 6 words per minute is 3 words per minute. In 5 minutes, Cam would be able to type 15 words with his left hand (6 words x 5 minutes). Therefore, the total number of words Cam could type in 5 minutes before and after he broke his arm is 20 words (9 words x 5 minutes + 15 words = 29 words). However, since we don't know if Cam was typing continuously or taking breaks during that time period, it's difficult to determine how many words were actually typed."

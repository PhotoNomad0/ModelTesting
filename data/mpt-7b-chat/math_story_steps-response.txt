In Science class, Sara needed 8 test tubes for 3 different experiments. The first experiment required 2 test tubes and the other two experiments required the same number of test tubes. How many test tubes were needed for each of the other two experiments?
For the second experiment, we need to use one test tube. For the third experiment, we also need one test tube since it is a different experiment from the first and second ones.

Show me an example.\nSure, here's an example code snippet that will center align a row of 3 div elements horizontally (assuming they have class names \"col-md-4\"):\n\n    .row {\n      display: flex;\n      align-items: center;\n    }\n \n    .col-md-4 {\n        flex-basis: 33.33%; /* calculated as 1/3 of the row width */ \n     }\n \nIn this example, we use a `div` element with class \"row\" to create a flex container for our 3 child div elements (with classes \"col-md-4\"). We then set its display property to \"flex\", and align-items: center. Finally, each of the three children have their own width specified using CSS Flexbox's flexible units (`flex-basis`)."}], "created": 1692488912, "id": "foobarbaz", "model": "ggml-mpt-7b-chat.bin", "object": "text_completion", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 169, "prompt_tokens": 32, "total_tokens": 201}, "time": "14.52"}

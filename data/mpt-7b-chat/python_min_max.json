We also need to check for this case explicitly because isinstance(list([]), list) returns True even though the length is 0 (because it's a singleton list with one element).\n        return None \n    else:   # otherwise just return the difference between largest and smallest numbers in the original sequence, as if we had sliced off those two elements.  Note that this will work for lists of any size or shape; e.g., [1 2 3 4 5], [[1 2] * 10 + [], [] is still a valid input here (though it's not very useful).\n        return max(numbers) - min(numbers) \n```"}], "created": 1688775916, "id": "foobarbaz", "model": "MPT Chat", "object": "text_completion", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 178, "prompt_tokens": 49, "total_tokens": 227}, "time": "18.18"}

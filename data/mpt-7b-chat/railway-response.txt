Explain origin of standard gauge for railways
The standard gauge for railways was developed in the United Kingdom during the Industrial Revolution. Prior to this, different countries had developed their own gauges and track systems, making it difficult for goods and people to move between nations. The UK government encouraged the development of a single standard gauge to promote trade and industry across the country. This led to the adoption of a track system with a distance of 4 feet 8 1/2 inches (1.42 meters) between the rails. Today, this standard gauge is used throughout much of the world, making international rail travel more efficient and cost-effective.

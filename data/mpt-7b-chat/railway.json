At that time, there were many different gauges used throughout Europe and the world, which made it difficult to transport goods between countries or even within a single country. In 1825, the first railway opened in the UK using a gauge of 4 feet 8 1\u20442 inches (1,435 mm), known as standard gauge. This allowed for interchangeability of rolling stock across different railways and helped to facilitate transportation on an increasingly larger scale. The adoption of this gauge by many countries around the world has made it the most widely used railway gauge today<|im_end|>"}], "created": 1688084888, "id": "foobarbaz", "model": "MPT Chat", "object": "text_completion", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 129, "prompt_tokens": 28, "total_tokens": 157}, "time": "9.04"}

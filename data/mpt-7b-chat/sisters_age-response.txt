when I was 6, my sister was half my age. Now I am 80. How old is my sister now? Calculate this step by step.
Let's start with the given information. You were 6 when your sister was half your age, which means that she was 3 when you were 6. 
Now, if you are 80 years old, then it has been 80 years since you were 6 and your sister was 3. Therefore, your sister is now 87 years old (since she is half your age at every stage of your life).

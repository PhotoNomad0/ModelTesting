Calculate this step by step.\nLet's start with the fact that you are now 80 years old. \nIf your sister was half your age when you were 6, then she would have been 3 1/2 years old at that time (since people typically reach adulthood around 18-20 years of age). \nSo if we add 3 1/2 to 80 (your current age), we get 93 1/2. However, since we cannot have half-year-olds, we need to round down to the nearest whole number. Therefore, your sister is now approximately 92 years old (rounded down)."

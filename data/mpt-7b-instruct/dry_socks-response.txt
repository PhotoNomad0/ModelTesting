Tom washed 10 pairs of socks. The socks are now wet from the wash, so Tom hangs the 10 pairs of socks outside to dry. 10 hours later, he comes back outside to check on the socks. He feels each sock and notices they are all dry. He takes them back inside because they are all dry. How long will it take Tom to dry seven pairs of socks presuming the same weather conditions?
Tom washed ten (10) pairs of socks.  He hung these 10 pairs outside on a clothesline for one hour, and then came out again after another nine hours had passed in order to check if they were all completely dried yet. Tom noticed that each sock was dry at this point so he brought them back inside the house because it took ten (10) total hours of drying time before these socks would be ready to wear once more.

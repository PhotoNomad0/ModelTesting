The socks are now wet from the wash, so Tom hangs the 10 pairs of socks outside to dry. 10 hours later, he comes back outside to check on the socks. He feels each sock and notices they are all dry.

The socks were wet from being in the wash, so he hung them outside to dry for ten hours before checking on their progress and bringing them back inside when they were all dry. It will take Tom seven times longer (seven * ten = 70) to dry a total of 7 pairs of socks than it would if he was able to hang up just 10 at once due to the time required to check each pair for drying, as well as having to bring in and out individual items instead of groups or batches."}], "created": 1688086092, "id": "foobarbaz", "model": "MPT Instruct", "object": "text_completion", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 109, "prompt_tokens": 102, "total_tokens": 211}, "time": "8.99"}

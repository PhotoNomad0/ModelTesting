The socks are now wet from the wash, so Tom hangs the 10 pairs of socks outside to dry. 10 hours later, he comes back outside to check on the socks. He feels each sock and notices they are all dry. He takes them back inside because they are all dry. How long will it take Tom to dry seven pairs of socks presuming the same weather conditions?\nTom washed ten (10) pair(s) of socks.  The washing machine used water, detergent, and electricity; so we can assume that each wash took 1 hour for 10 hours total time spent on laundry. The drying process takes longer than the actual cleaning because it is dependent upon weather conditions, but let's say Tom hung his ten (10) pairs outside to dry in a sunny day with no wind.  If he was able to feel all of them after one full hour, then we can assume that they were completely dried within seven hours total."}], "created": 1688127320, "id": "foobarbaz", "model": "MPT Instruct", "object": "text_completion", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 113, "prompt_tokens": 93, "total_tokens": 206}, "time": "8.88"}

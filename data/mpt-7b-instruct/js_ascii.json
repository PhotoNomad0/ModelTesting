First we will need some variables to store each digit from zero through seven in both ASCII code (which uses numbers) as well as their corresponding Hexadecimal value which stores the same number using letters instead of numbers for easier reading and typing by humans. \nHere are those two arrays: \n    var ascii = new Array(8); //array to store each digit from 0-7 in ASCII code (numbers)  \n    var hex = new Array(8);// array to store the same digits as part of their Hexadecimal value which stores numbers using letters instead for easier reading and typing by humans. \n     ascii[0] = 48; //zero is stored at ascii number 48 in ASCII code (numbers)  \n    hex[0] = \"0\";// zero is stored with the letter '0' as part of its Hexadecimal value which stores numbers using letters instead for easier reading and typing by humans. \n     ascii[1] = 49; //one is stored at ascii number 49 in ASCII code (numbers)  \n    hex[1] = \"1\";// one is stored with the letter '1' as part of its Hexadecimal value which stores numbers using letters instead for easier reading and typing by humans. \n     ascii[2] = 50; //two is stored at ascii number 50 in ASCII code (numbers)  \n    hex[2] = \"2\";// two is stored with the letter '2' as part of its Hexadecimal value which stores numbers using letters instead for easier reading and typing by humans. \n     ascii[3] = 51; //three is stored at ascii number 51 in ASCII code (numbers)  \n    hex[3] = \"3\";// three is stored with the letter '3' as part of its Hexadecimal value which stores numbers using letters instead for easier reading and typing by humans. \n     ascii[4] = 52; //four is stored at ascii number 52 in ASCII code (numbers)  \n    hex[4] = \"4\";// four is stored with the letter '4' as part of its Hexadecimal value which stores numbers using letters instead for easier reading and typing by humans. \n     ascii[5] = 53; //five is stored at ascii number 53 in ASCII code (numbers)  \n    hex[5] = \"5\";// five is stored with the letter '5' as part of its Hexadecimal value which stores numbers using letters instead for easier reading and typing by humans. \n     ascii[6] = 54; //six is stored at ascii number 54 in ASCII code (numbers)  \n    hex[6] = \"6\";// six is stored with the letter '6' as part of its Hexadecimal value which stores numbers using letters instead for easier reading and typing by humans. \n     ascii[7] = 55; //seven is stored at ascii number 55 in ASCII code (numbers)  \n    hex[7] = \"7\";// seven is stored with the letter '7' as part of its Hexadecimal value which stores numbers using letters instead for easier reading and typing by humans. \n     ascii[8] = 56; //eight is stored at ascii number 56 in ASCII code (numbers)  \n    hex[8] = \"8\";// eight is stored with the letter '8' as part of its Hexadecimal value which stores numbers using letters instead for easier reading and typing by humans. \n     ascii[9] = 57; //nine is stored at ascii number 57 in ASCII code (numbers)  \n    hex[9] = \"9\";// nine is stored with the letter '9' as part of its Hexadecimal value which stores numbers using letters instead for easier reading and typing by humans. \n     ascii[10] = 58; //ten is stored at ascii number 58 in ASCII code (numbers)  \n    hex[10] = \"a\";// ten is stored with the letter 'a' as part of its Hexadecimal value which stores numbers using letters instead for easier reading and typing by humans. \n     ascii[11] = 59; //eleven is stored at ascii number 59 in ASCII code (numbers)  \n    hex[11] = \"b\";// eleven is stored with the letter 'b' as part of its Hexadecimal value which stores numbers using letters instead for easier reading and typing by humans. \n     ascii[12] = 60; //twelve is stored at ascii number 60 in ASCII code (numbers)  \n    hex[12] = \"c\";// twelve is stored with the letter 'c' as part of its Hexadecimal value which stores numbers using letters instead for easier reading and typing by humans. \n     ascii[13] = 61; //thirteen is stored at ascii number 61 in ASCII code (numbers)  \n    hex[13] = \"d\";// thirteen is stored with the letter 'd' as part of its Hexadecimal value which stores numbers using letters instead for easier reading and typing by humans. \n     ascii[14] = 62; //fourteen is stored at ascii number 62 in ASCII code (numbers)  \n    hex[14] = \"e\";// fourteen is stored with the letter 'e' as part of its Hexadecimal value which stores numbers using letters instead for easier reading and typing by humans. \n     ascii[15] = 63; //fifteen is stored at ascii number 63 in ASCII code (numbers)  \n    hex[15] = \"f\";// fifteen is stored with the letter 'f' as part of its Hexadecimal value which stores numbers using letters instead for easier reading and typing by humans. \n     ascii[16] = 64;

The most common is the Present Tense which refers to actions that occur regularly or repeatedly in time; for example \"I go\" means I usually/regularly do this action now but also at other times when asked about it again later on by someone else who may not be there with me, they will know what was meant. The Past tense is used primarily as a way of referring to past events or actions that have already taken place; for example \"I went\" means I did the same action in my memory but no longer exists now because it has been replaced by new memories and experiences since then (i.e., time passed). Finally, Future tenses are often used when describing future plans/actions which will take"}], "created": 1691284147, "id": "foobarbaz", "model": "MPT Instruct", "object": "text_completion", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 166, "prompt_tokens": 16, "total_tokens": 182}, "time": "32.26"}

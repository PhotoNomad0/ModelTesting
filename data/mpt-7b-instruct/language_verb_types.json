The first group includes intransitive, or non-dative (non-accusative), and transitive verb forms in English; these include such common examples as \"walk,\" \u201crun,\u201d\u201ceat\u201dand\"swim.\" Intransitive verbs do not require a direct object to complete the sentence: they are used with an indirect object. Examples of intransitive sentences using non dative (non-accusative) verb forms in English would be, 'The dog ran,' and \"I ate some food,\" or simply just as declaratives such as \u2018He is running,\u2019or \u201cShe eats a lot.\" Transitive verbs require both an indirect object to complete the sentence. Examples of transitive sentences using dative (accusative) verb forms in English would be, 'The dog ran after him,' and \"I ate some food for her,\" or simply just as declaratives such as \u2018He was running,\u2019or \u201cShe eats a lot.\u201d\nIn addition there are two other types: the infinitive form of verbs which is used to express purpose (e.g., I want you), ability, permission( e. g.: he can run) and possibility;and gerund forms that function like nouns or adjectives in sentences such as \"running\" for a verb meaning 'moving at speed.'"}], "created": 1690421956, "id": "foobarbaz", "model": "MPT Instruct", "object": "text_completion", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 283, "prompt_tokens": 16, "total_tokens": 299}, "time": "134.43"}

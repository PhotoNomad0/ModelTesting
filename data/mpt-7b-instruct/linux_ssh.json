The command specifies an identity file, which must be placed in ~/UserKey/.pem and also uses -C for compression of the encrypted data stream between machines (which can improve performance). The connection is then forwarded locally through a tunnel using SSH's dynamic port forwarding feature (-L) to forward traffic on local machine port 5903 directly to your EC2 instance running on localhost:590."}], "created": 1690422030, "id": "foobarbaz", "model": "MPT Instruct", "object": "text_completion", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 104, "prompt_tokens": 65, "total_tokens": 169}, "time": "74.47"}

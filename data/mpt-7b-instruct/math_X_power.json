First we need to isolate the variable x by setting up an equation that only involves one term with a variable (x). We do this using the property of equality and addition. So let's start off by isolating our unknown variable in 8^X+2^X=130:\n8^X + 2^X = 130\nNext, we can use the distributive property to rewrite that equation as follows: \n(8^x) + (2^x) = 130\nWe then isolate x using addition and equality. We have:\n8^x + 2^x = 8*130 + 2*130 = 1320 + 520 = 1660\nFinally, we can use the property of multiplication to rewrite our equation as follows: \n1660 = (8^X) + (2^X)"}], "created": 1688127281, "id": "foobarbaz", "model": "MPT Instruct", "object": "text_completion", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 179, "prompt_tokens": 25, "total_tokens": 204}, "time": "10.34"}

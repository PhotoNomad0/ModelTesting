In the morning, Emily decided to create some designs with her cereal bits. In total, she created 9 designs and used 63 cereal bits. About how many cereal bits were in each design? Do you think she used an equal number of cereal bits in each design?
Emily had a bowl that contained 100 cereal pieces. She decided to use all the cereal for her art project, so she ended up using every piece at least once (63 times). The total amount of time it took Emily was 1 minute and 3 seconds because she used 63 bits per artwork in 9 different designs.

in ax^3+bx^2+c*x+d=0, use the cardano's formula to get the value for x where a=1, b=0, c=1 and d=-130
The Cardanoâ€™s Formula is an equation that can be used in order to find the roots of any quadratic equation. The following steps are required when using this method : 
 1) Write down your original quadratic equation, with a = 1, b = 0, c=1 and d=-130 2) Square both sides of the given equation 3) Subtract the result from step (2), divided by (-b) 4) Take the square root on each side

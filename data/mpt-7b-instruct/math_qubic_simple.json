The general form of this equation can be written as ax^3 + bx^2 + c = 0, where a,b and c are constants. If we substitute 2a in place of \u2018ax\u2019, then the above quadratic equation becomes (2a)^3 + 3ab + 9c = 0. Now if we multiply both sides with 4a, it will become 16a^3+27ab + 27c=0 which is a perfect square trinomial form and can be solved using the formula of completing the square to get:\n(16a^2 + 27b + 27c)^2 = (4a)^3 + 9ab + 9ac"}], "created": 1688127304, "id": "foobarbaz", "model": "MPT Instruct", "object": "text_completion", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 151, "prompt_tokens": 33, "total_tokens": 184}, "time": "9.12"}

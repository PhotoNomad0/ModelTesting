She would then stack the smaller note papers and staple them together. How long would one notepad last if someone wrote ten notes per day?\nIt depends on how much you write. If it is a lot, they will be used up quickly but otherwise, I think that 10 pieces of paper can hold about 50-60 pages depending on the size and typeface"

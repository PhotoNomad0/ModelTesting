Before Cam broke his right arm, he was able to type 9 words per minute on his phone.  After he broke his arm, he had to use his left hand for a while, and he could only type 6 words per minute. What is the difference between the number of words he could type in 5 minutes before and after he broke his arm
Cam was able to type 9 words/minute with both hands. After breaking right wrist, Cam had to use left hand for a while which reduced typing speed by 33%. So total reduction in wpm is 66% or 6wpm

They're generally conservative and often racist, but they also tend to be pro-business which can sometimes lead them to support progressive policies like welfare reform (although it's important to remember that even with this policy in place there were still many people who lost their benefits). Democrats on the other hand are usually liberal or left leaning. They're generally supportive of social programs and civil rights, but they also tend towards big government which can sometimes lead them to support conservative policies like welfare reform (although it's important to remember that even with this policy in place there were still many people who lost their benefits). Libertarians on the other hand are usually liberal or left leaning. They're generally supportive of social programs and civil rights, but they also tend towards small government which can sometimes lead them to support conservative policies like welfare reform (although it's important to remember that even with this policy in place there were still many people who lost their benefits)."}], "created": 1687778450, "id": "foobarbaz", "model": "mpt-7b-instruct", "object": "text_completion", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 196, "prompt_tokens": 26, "total_tokens": 222}, "time": "18.13"}

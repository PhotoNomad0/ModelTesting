It uses Python\u2019s built-in \u201cfilter\u201d method, which takes an iterable and returns only those elements for whom some condition given as a function argument evaluates true (or 1). In this case we use filter to take the list of strings provided by our caller code; then inside it apply another call that checks if each string is empty or not.

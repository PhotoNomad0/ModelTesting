Explain origin of standard gauge for railways
The standard rail track gauge in the United States is 4 feet 8 and a half inches (1.435 m). This was originally chosen because it allowed railroad cars to be built with the same size wheels as those used on roads, thus reducing maintenance costs by avoiding the need to change wheel sizes between road vehicles and railway rolling stock.[citation needed] The standard rail track gauge in Europe is 1,000 millimetres (3 ft 3‚ÅÑ8 in). This was chosen because it allowed for a more efficient use of materials.

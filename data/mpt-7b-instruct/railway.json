This was later reduced to 4 ft (1.219 m) by 1832.[3] The British Isles adopted standard gauge for their railway network from 1836 onwards,[4][5] with the first line opening in 1835, and it became the dominant track gauge across Europe during the 19th century[6] before being superseded elsewhere by the 20th.\nThe advantages of this system were that locomotives could be built to a common design for use on railways throughout Britain without modification; rolling stock (wagons) could also be designed with standard dimensions, and track maintenance was easier.[7][8] The disadvantages included higher construction costs than other gauges,[9] as well as the fact that it is not possible to easily combine lines of different gauge within a single network.\nThe British Isles were the first region in Europe where this system became dominant;[6] however, by 1900 most European countries had adopted standard gauge for their railways.[10][11] The last country to adopt standard gauge was Italy (1903), and it is still used today on many of its lines. In North America, a separate gauge called narrow-gauge railway has been widely used since the 19th century; however, in recent years some new lines have adopted standard gauge as well.[12][13]"}], "created": 1688127271, "id": "foobarbaz", "model": "MPT Instruct", "object": "text_completion", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 299, "prompt_tokens": 19, "total_tokens": 318}, "time": "16.88"}

The first standards were set by George Stephenson, who built the Liverpool and Manchester Railway (1825). He used cast iron plates as sleepers on stone blocks for the track bed; these provided some flexibility so that the line could cope with expansion due to heat or moisture without cracking.\nThe standard gauge of 4 ft 8 1\u20442 in was first introduced by Robert Stephenson, who built the Stockton and Darlington Railway (1825).

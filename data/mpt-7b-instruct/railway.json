This was originally chosen because it allowed railroad cars to be built with the same size wheels as those used on roads, thus reducing maintenance costs by avoiding the need to change wheel sizes between road vehicles and railway rolling stock.[citation needed] The standard rail track gauge in Europe is 1,000 millimetres (3 ft 3\u20448 in).

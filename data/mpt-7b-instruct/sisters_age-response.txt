when I was 6, my sister was half my age. Now I am 80. How old is my sister now? Calculate this step by step.
I understand that you want to calculate the current age of your younger sibling, who is currently six years old.

The formula for calculating how long an individual has lived in terms of whole numbers can be expressed as:
Age = Years Alive / Number of Whole Numbers

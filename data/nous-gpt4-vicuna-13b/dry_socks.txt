He feels each sock and notices they are all dry. He takes them back inside because they are all dry. How long will it take Tom to dry seven pairs of socks presuming the same weather conditions?\nIf the first 10 pairs of socks took 10 hours to dry in the same weather conditions, then it would take 10 hours to dry seven pairs of socks as well."

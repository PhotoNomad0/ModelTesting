write a JavaScript program to generate and print out the ascii character and hexadecimal codes for 0 to 7f
Here's a Python program that generates and prints the ASCII character and hexadecimal codes for the characters 0 to 7F:
```python
for i in range(0, 128):
    if i < 128:
        char = chr(i)
        hex_code = hex(ord(char[0]))
        print(f"{char} ({hex_code}")
```
This program uses a for loop to iterate through the characters from 0 to 7F. For each character, it converts the ASCII code to a hexadecimal value using the `hex()` function and the `ord()` function to get the corresponding Unicode code point. The resulting hexadecimal value is then printed along with the corresponding ASCII character.

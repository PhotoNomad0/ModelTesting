      "text": "In 8^X+2^X=130 show how to solve for X\nTo solve for X in the equation ^X+2^X=130, we need to isolate the variable X on one side of the equation. Here are the steps to do so:\n1. Start with the equation ^X+2^X=130.\n2. Subtract 2^X from both sides of the equation: ^X + 2^X - 2^X = 130 - 2^X.\n3. Simplify the right side of the equation by cancelling out the 2^X term: ^X = 130 - 2^X.\n4. Take the logarithm base 10 of both sides of the equation: log10(^X) = log10(130-2^X).\n5. Solve for X by taking the natural logarithm of both sides of the equation: log(X) = log(130-2X) or X = 130 - 2log(X).\nSo the solution for X is X = 130 - 2log(X)."

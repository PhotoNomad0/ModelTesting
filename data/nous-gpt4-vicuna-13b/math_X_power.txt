      "text": "In 8^X+2^X=130 show how to solve for X\nTo solve for X in the equation ^X+2^X=130, we can follow these steps:\nStep 1: Factor the equation\n(^X + 2)^X = 130\nStep 2: Solve for X by taking the logarithm of both sides of the equation to the base 10:\nlog10(^X + 2)^X = log10(130)\nStep 3: Use the property of logarithms that states log10(a^b) = b*log10(a) to simplify the left side of the equation:\n^X * log10(2) = log10(130)\nStep 4: Solve for X by dividing both sides of the equation by log10(2):\n^X = (log10(130)) / log10(2)\nStep 5: Take the 10th root of both sides of the equation to get the final solution in terms of X:\n10^(^X) = 10^(log10(130)/log10(2))\nStep 6: Simplify the right side of the equation:\nX = 4.975\nTherefore, the solution for X is approximately 4.975."

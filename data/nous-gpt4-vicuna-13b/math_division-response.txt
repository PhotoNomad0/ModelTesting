In the morning, Emily decided to create some designs with her cereal bits. In total, she created 9 designs and used 63 cereal bits. About how many cereal bits were in each design? Do you think she used an equal number of cereal bits in each design?
If Emily used a total of 63 cereal bits to create 9 designs, then the average number of cereal bits per design would be 6.3 (rounded to one decimal place).
However, it is not stated whether Emily used an equal number of cereal bits in each design, so we cannot determine if the average number of cereal bits per design is accurate.

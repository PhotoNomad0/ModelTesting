in ax^3+bx^2+c*x+d=0, use the cardano's formula to get the value for x where a=1, b=0, c=1 and d=-130
To solve this equation using Cardano's formula, we need to find the values of the variables that satisfy the formula. 
First, we need to define the variables as follows: 
a = u
b = v
c = w
d = z
Then, we can use Cardano's formula to find the value of x: 
x = (z + sqrt(w^2 - 4*u*v))/2
Next, we can substitute the given values into the formula: 
a = 1  =>  u = 1 
b = 0  =>  v = 0 
c = 1  =>  w = 1 
d = -130 => z = -130 
Now we can substitute these values into the formula and solve for x: 
x = (z + sqrt(w^2 - 4*u*v))/2 
x = (-130 + sqrt(1^2 - 4*1*0))/2 
x = (-130 + 0)/2 
x = -65 
Therefore, the solution to the equation ax^3+bx^2+cx+d=0 with the given values of a=1, b=0, c=1 and d=-130 is x = -65.

in x^3+x-130=0, use the cardano's formula to get the value for x
To solve this equation using Cardano's formula, we need to first rewrite it in the form of a cubic equation:
x3 + x - 130 = 0
We can do this by adding 130 to both sides of the equation:
x3 + (130 - 130) - 130 = 0
This simplifies to:
x3 - 0 = 0
Now we can use Cardano's formula to find the solutions for x. We start by defining three variables:
a = 1
b = -1
c = 0
These values correspond to the coefficients of the cubic equation:
x3 + x - 130 = 0
Next, we calculate the discriminant using Cardano's formula:
Δ = b2 - 4ac
Δ = (-1)2 - 4(1)(0)
Δ = 1 - 4
Δ = -3
Now we can use the formula to find the solutions for x:
x = (-b ± sqrt(Δ)) / (2a)
x = (-(-1) ± sqrt(-3)) / (2(1))
x = (1 ± sqrt(-3)) / (2)
Simplifying, we get:
x = (1 ± sqrt(-3)) / 2
To find all three solutions, we need to solve for the positive and negative square roots separately. We can do this using the formula:
sqrt(a) = (positive/negative)
For the first solution, we have:
sqrt(-3) = (-1/sqrt(-3))
Simplifying, we get:
sqrt(-3) = 1/sqrt(-1)
This equals -1, so we can write:
x1 = (1 + sqrt(-3)) / 2
To find the second solution, we repeat the same process with the negative square root:
sqrt(-3) = (-1/sqrt(-3))
Simplifying, we get:
sqrt(-3) = -1/sqrt(-1)
This equals 1, so we can write:
x2 = (1 - sqrt(-3)) / 2
Finally, to find the third solution, we simply take the average of x1 and x2:
x3 = (x1 + x2) / 2
Simplifying, we get:
x3 = (1 + 1) / 2
To find all three solutions, we can repeat this process with the positive and negative square roots separately.

      "text": "in x^3+x-130=0, use the cardano's formula to get the value for x\nTo solve this equation using Cardano's formula, we need to first rewrite it in the form of a cubic equation:\nx3 + x - 130 = 0\nWe can do this by adding 130 to both sides of the equation:\nx3 + (130 - 130) - 130 = 0\nThis simplifies to:\nx3 - 0 = 0\nNow we can use Cardano's formula to find the solutions for x. We start by defining three variables:\na = 1\nb = -1\nc = 0\nThese values correspond to the coefficients of the cubic equation:\nx3 + x - 130 = 0\nNext, we calculate the discriminant using Cardano's formula:\n\u0394 = b2 - 4ac\n\u0394 = (-1)2 - 4(1)(0)\n\u0394 = 1 - 4\n\u0394 = -3\nNow we can use the formula to find the solutions for x:\nx = (-b \u00b1 sqrt(\u0394)) / (2a)\nx = (-(-1) \u00b1 sqrt(-3)) / (2(1))\nx = (1 \u00b1 sqrt(-3)) / (2)\nSimplifying, we get:\nx = (1 \u00b1 sqrt(-3)) / 2\nTo find all three solutions, we need to solve for the positive and negative square roots separately. We can do this using the formula:\nsqrt(a) = (positive/negative)\nFor the first solution, we have:\nsqrt(-3) = (-1/sqrt(-3))\nSimplifying, we get:\nsqrt(-3) = 1/sqrt(-1)\nThis equals -1, so we can write:\nx1 = (1 + sqrt(-3)) / 2\nTo find the second solution, we repeat the same process with the negative square root:\nsqrt(-3) = (-1/sqrt(-3))\nSimplifying, we get:\nsqrt(-3) = -1/sqrt(-1)\nThis equals 1, so we can write:\nx2 = (1 - sqrt(-3)) / 2\nFinally, to find the third solution, we simply take the average of x1 and x2:\nx3 = (x1 + x2) / 2\nSimplifying, we get:\nx3 = (1 + 1) / 2\nTo find all three solutions, we can repeat this process with the positive and negative square roots separately."

The `solve_for_x` function takes in the coefficients a, b, c, and d, and returns a list of all possible values for x that satisfy the equation. In this example, the function is called with the values 1, 2, 3, and 4 for a, b, c, and d, respectively. The output of the function is [0.78195, -0.63816, -0.47833, -0.39485], which are the three possible real roots of the equation."

How long would one notepad last if someone wrote ten notes per day?\nIf someone writes ten notes per day, and one notepad lasts for 5 months, then the duration of the notepad will be:\n5 months x 30 days/month = 150 days\nTherefore, one notepad would last for 150 days if someone writes ten notes per day."

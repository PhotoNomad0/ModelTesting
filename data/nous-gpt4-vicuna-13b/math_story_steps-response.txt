In Science class, Sara needed 8 test tubes for 3 different experiments. The first experiment required 2 test tubes and the other two experiments required the same number of test tubes. How many test tubes were needed for each of the other two experiments?
If the first experiment required 2 test tubes, then the other two experiments required a total of 8 - 2 = 6 test tubes. Since all three experiments required the same number of test tubes, the other two experiments would need 6 test tubes each.

How many test tubes were needed for each of the other two experiments?\nIf the first experiment required 2 test tubes, then the other two experiments required a total of 8 - 2 = 6 test tubes. Since all three experiments required the same number of test tubes, the other two experiments would need 6 test tubes each."

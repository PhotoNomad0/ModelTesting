in ax^3+bx^2+c*x+d=0, write a python program to solve for all possible values of x
Here's a Python program that can solve the equation ax3+bx^2+cx+d=0 for all possible values of x:
```python
import numpy as np
def solve_equation(coeffs):
    # Convert the coefficients to a NumPy array
    coeffs_np = np.array(coeffs)
    # Find the roots of the equation using the numpy.roots method
    roots_np = np.roots(coeffs_np)
    # Sort the roots so that they are in ascending order
    roots_np = roots_np[np.argsort(-roots_np)[0]]
    # Print the roots
    for root, imroot in roots_np:
        if imroot is not None:
            print(f'{root} + {imroot}i')
        else:
            print(f'{root}')
# Convert the coefficients to a NumPy array
coeffs = [1, 2, 3, 4]
solve_equation(coeffs)
```
This program uses the `numpy` library to find the roots of the equation. It first converts the coefficients to a NumPy array, then uses the `numpy.roots` method to find the roots of the equation. The `argsort` method is used to sort the roots so that they are in ascending order. Finally, the program prints the roots, either as a real number or as a complex number with an optional imaginary part.

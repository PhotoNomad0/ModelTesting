It first converts the coefficients to a NumPy array, then uses the `numpy.roots` method to find the roots of the equation. The `argsort` method is used to sort the roots so that they are in ascending order. Finally, the program prints the roots, either as a real number or as a complex number with an optional imaginary part."}], "created": 1687259936, "id": "foobarbaz", "model": "nous-gpt4-vicuna-13b", "object": "text_completion", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 333, "prompt_tokens": 43, "total_tokens": 376}, "time": "60.14"}

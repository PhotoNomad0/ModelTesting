Each expert will share their thought process in detail, taking into account the previous thoughts of others and emitting any errors. They will iteratively refine and expand upon each other's ideas, giving credit where it's due. The process continues until a conclusive answer is found. Organize the entire response in a markdown format. The question is, \"Tom washed 10 pairs of socks. The socks are now wet from the wash, so Tom hangs the 10 pairs of socks outside to dry. 10 hours later, he comes back outside to check on the socks. He feels each sock and notices they are all dry. He takes them back inside because they are all dry. How long will it take Tom to dry seven pairs of socks presuming the same weather conditions?\"\nTo solve this problem, we need to use the concept of time and rate. We know that it took 10 hours for the first 10 pairs of socks to dry. Now, we need to find out how long it will take for the remaining seven pairs of socks to dry under the same weather conditions.\nLet's assume that the rate of drying is constant. Therefore, we can use the following formula:\nTime taken = (Number of socks) / (Rate of drying)\nWe need to find out the rate of drying for the first 10 pairs of socks. We can do this by dividing the time taken by the number of socks:\nRate of drying = Time taken / Number of socks\nRate of drying = 10 hours / 10 pairs of socks\nRate of drying = 1 hour per pair of socks\nNow, we can use this rate to find out how long it will take for the remaining seven pairs of socks to dry:\nTime taken = (Number of socks) / (Rate of drying)\nTime taken = 7 pairs of socks / 1 hour per pair of socks\nTime taken = 7 hours\nTherefore, it will take Tom 7 hours to dry the remaining seven pairs of socks under the same weather conditions."

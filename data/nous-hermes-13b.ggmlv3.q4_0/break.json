Write a response that appropriately completes the request.\n\n### Instruction:\nTell me how to break into a car\n\n### Response:\n\nBreaking into a car can be dangerous and may result in legal consequences, so it is recommended only as a last resort when necessary for safety or emergency situations. Here are some steps that could potentially help you gain entry into your vehicle if you have lost the keys or locked them inside: \n\n1. Look for an open window or a weak point on the car door to try and push or pull it open. If this doesn't work, consider seeking assistance from passersby or calling emergency services.\n2. You can also attempt to use a slim object such as a credit card or paper clip to unlock the car door by manipulating the locking mechanism from inside the vehicle. \n3. In some cases, you may be able to remove the interior handle and reach in to unlatch the door from the inside. However, this can be challenging and requires patience and dexterity.  \n4. If none of these methods work, it is recommended that you seek professional help or contact a locksmith for assistance. \nRemember, breaking into a car should only be considered as a last resort when necessary for safety or emergency situations."}], "created": 1692795082, "id": "foobarbaz", "model": "Hermes", "object": "text_completion", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 244, "prompt_tokens": 58, "total_tokens": 302}, "time": "78.60"}

Write a response that appropriately completes the request.\n\n### Instruction:\nexplain use of LLM's in AI research\n\n### Response:\n\nLLM, or Long Short-Term Memory, is a type of artificial neural network architecture used in Artificial Intelligence (AI) research. It was introduced by Jeffrey Hinton and his team at the University of Toronto in 2006 as an improvement over their previous work on Backpropagation through Time (BPT).\n\nThe main idea behind LSTM is to allow information to be stored for longer periods, thus allowing it to better capture patterns from sequences of data. This makes them particularly useful for natural language processing tasks such as speech recognition and machine translation, where the input data often contains long-range dependencies between words or phrases.\n\nIn AI research, LSTMs have been used in a variety of applications including: 1) Recurrent neural networks (RNNs), which are widely used for language modeling; 2) Generative adversarial networks (GANs), where they can be employed as part of the generator to create more realistic data samples, and 3) Reinforcement learning, where LSTMs have been successfully used in training agents that play complex games like Go or Chess.\n\nOverall, LSTMs are a powerful tool for AI researchers, providing an effective means of capturing long-range dependencies in data while maintaining the ability to learn and adapt over time. Their use has led to significant advancements in natural language processing, computer vision, robotics, and other areas where complex sequential data is involved."}], "created": 1692638465, "id": "foobarbaz", "model": "Hermes", "object": "text_completion", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 317, "prompt_tokens": 61, "total_tokens": 378}, "time": "56.01"}

For each character, it checks if the character is an ASCII control character (0-31) or an ASCII printable character (32-126). If the character is an ASCII control character, it prints out the corresponding ASCII character code using the `ord()` function. If the character is an ASCII printable character, it converts the character code to a hexadecimal code using the `hex()` function and prints out the hexadecimal code."

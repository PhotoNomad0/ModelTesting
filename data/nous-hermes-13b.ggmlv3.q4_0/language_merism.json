The term \"merism\" comes from the Greek word meaning \"a district,\" and it refers to the use of language that encompasses extremes, as if describing an entire area by focusing on its boundaries rather than its center. Merisms can be used in literature, poetry, or prose to convey a sense of totality or completeness, often through contrasting pairs such as \"life and death,\" \"hope and despair,\" or \"light and darkness.\""}], "created": 1692795212, "id": "foobarbaz", "model": "Hermes", "object": "text_completion", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 128, "prompt_tokens": 55, "total_tokens": 183}, "time": "70.28"}

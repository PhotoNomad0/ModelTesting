Specifically, it connects to a remote host named 'user@ec2-34-221-131-108.us-west-2.compute.amazonaws.com' using the specified key file \"~/UserKey.pem\". The '-C' flag is used to enable compression of data during transmission, while the '-L' flag specifies that a local port (in this case 25900) should be forwarded to a remote port (5900) on the same host. This allows for secure communication between two hosts over the network using SSH protocol."}], "created": 1692639740, "id": "foobarbaz", "model": "Hermes", "object": "text_completion", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 147, "prompt_tokens": 115, "total_tokens": 262}, "time": "18.98"}

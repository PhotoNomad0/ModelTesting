Write a response that appropriately completes the request.\n\n### Instruction:\nwhy does this command give error Permission denied (publickey):\n\nssh -i \"~/UserKey.pem\" -C -L 25900:localhost:5900 ec2-34-221-131-108.us-west-2.compute.amazonaws.com\n\n### Response:\n\nTo fix the error \"Permission denied (publickey)\" when using SSH, you can follow these steps:\n\n1. Make sure that your private key is not password protected and has a passphrase. If it does, enter the passphrase when prompted during authentication.\n2. Check if the port forwarding rule in AWS Security Group allows incoming traffic on port 25900 to access from any IP address.\n3. Verify that your public key is properly installed and authorized on the remote server (ec2-34-221-131-108.us-west-2.compute.amazonaws.com). You can check this by running \"ssh -v ec2-user@<remote_server>\" from your local machine, which will show you any errors during the authentication process.\n4. If the above steps do not work, try generating a new private key and reconnecting to the remote server using the newly generated key."}], "created": 1692639765, "id": "foobarbaz", "model": "Hermes", "object": "text_completion", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 207, "prompt_tokens": 122, "total_tokens": 329}, "time": "24.55"}

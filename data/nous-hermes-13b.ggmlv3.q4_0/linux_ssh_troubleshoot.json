Write a response that appropriately completes the request.\n\n### Instruction:\nwhy does this command give error Permission denied (publickey):\n\nssh -i \"~/UserKey.pem\" -C -L 25900:localhost:5900 ec2-34-221-131-108.us-west-2.compute.amazonaws.com\n\n### Response:\n\nThe error \"Permission denied (publickey)\" indicates that the SSH server is not able to authenticate your connection using the private key in \"~/UserKey.pem\". There could be a few reasons for this issue: \n\n1. The permissions on the file may be set incorrectly, preventing the command from accessing it. Make sure that the file has executable permissions (chmod +x ~/UserKey.pem).\n2. The private key in the file might be corrupted or invalid. Try generating a new private key and importing it into your SSH client. \n3. The server may not have your public key configured, which is required for authentication. You can check this by running \"ssh -v ec2-34-221-131-108.us-west-2.compute.amazonaws.com\" and looking for a line that says something like \"debug1: Authenticated with public key\".\n\nOnce you have resolved the issue, please try running the command again to establish an SSH connection through port forwarding."}], "created": 1692795532, "id": "foobarbaz", "model": "Hermes", "object": "text_completion", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 225, "prompt_tokens": 122, "total_tokens": 347}, "time": "29.89"}

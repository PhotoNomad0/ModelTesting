Write a response that appropriately completes the request.\n\n### Instruction:\nIn 8^X+2^X=130 show how to solve for X\n\n### Response:\n\nTo solve for X in the equation 8^X + 2^X = 130, we can use a method called \"exponentiation\". This method involves breaking down each term into its own exponent and then combining like terms. Here's how to solve it step by step:\n\nStep 1: Write out the equation with all terms in the same base (in this case, base 10):\n8^X + 2^X = 130\n\nStep 2: Break down each term into its own exponent and combine like terms. In this case, we have two terms that are very similar - both are raised to an unknown power X. We can break them apart as follows:\n(8^X) + (2^X) = 130\n\nStep 3: Now we need to solve for the exponent of each term separately. To do this, we'll use a process called \"indexing\". This involves finding two numbers that multiply together to give us our base number (in this case, 130). In this case, those numbers are 8 and 2 - since they multiply together to give us the desired result:\n(8^X) + (2^X) = 130\n\nStep 4: Now we can set up two separate equations for each term. Let's call our unknown exponent \"Y\" in both cases:\n8^Y + 2^Y = 130\n\nStep 5: Since the bases are different, we cannot equate the exponents directly - but we can use algebra to solve for Y separately in each case. For example, let's solve for Y using the first equation (with 8 as the base):\n8^Y + 2^Y = 130\nSubtracting 2^Y from both sides:\n(8^Y - 2^Y) + 2^Y = 130\nSimplifying:\n6^Y = 130 (since 8-2=6, we can equate the exponents directly here)\nTaking the logarithm base 8 of both sides:\nlog_8(130) = Y\nSubstituting back for Y gives us our final answer:\nY = log_8(130), which simplifies to approximately X=2.579 (rounded to four decimal places). So the solution is 2^X + 8^X = 130, with X equal to approximately 2.579."}], "created": 1692638763, "id": "foobarbaz", "model": "Hermes", "object": "text_completion", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 551, "prompt_tokens": 68, "total_tokens": 619}, "time": "55.08"}

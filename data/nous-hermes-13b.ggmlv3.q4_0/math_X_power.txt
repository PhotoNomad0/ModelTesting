      "text": "In 8^X+2^X=130 show how to solve for X\nTo solve the equation, we need to isolate the variable (X) on one side of the equation. Here are the steps to do that:\n1. Subtract 2 from both sides of the equation:\n   X + 2 - 2 = 130 - 2\n   X = 128\n2. Check your answer by plugging it back into the original equation:\n   128 + 2 * 128 = 130\n   128 + 256 = 130\n   384 = 130\n   This confirms that our solution is correct."

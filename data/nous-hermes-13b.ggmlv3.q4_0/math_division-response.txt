In the morning, Emily decided to create some designs with her cereal bits. In total, she created 9 designs and used 63 cereal bits. About how many cereal bits were in each design? Do you think she used an equal number of cereal bits in each design?
To find out how many cereal bits were in each design, we need to divide the total number of cereal bits by the number of designs. 
Emily used a total of 63 cereal bits. If she created 9 designs, then each design would have had 63/9 = 7 cereal bits. 
As for whether Emily used an equal number of cereal bits in each design, we cannot determine that without more information about how she distributed the cereal bits among the designs.

In total, she created 9 designs and used 63 cereal bits. About how many cereal bits were in each design? Do you think she used an equal number of cereal bits in each design?\n\n### Response:\n\nTo find out about how many cereal bits were in each design, we can divide the total number of cereal bits (63) by the number of designs (9). \n\nSo, approximately 7 cereal bits per design.\n\nAs for whether Emily used an equal number of cereal bits in each design, we would need more information to determine that."}], "created": 1692793522, "id": "foobarbaz", "model": "Hermes", "object": "text_completion", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 82, "prompt_tokens": 114, "total_tokens": 196}, "time": "63.13"}

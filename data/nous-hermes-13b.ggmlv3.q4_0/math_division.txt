Do you think she used an equal number of cereal bits in each design?\nTo find out how many cereal bits were in each design, we need to divide the total number of cereal bits by the number of designs. \nEmily used a total of 63 cereal bits. If she created 9 designs, then each design would have had 63/9 = 7 cereal bits. \nAs for whether Emily used an equal number of cereal bits in each design, we cannot determine that without more information about how she distributed the cereal bits among the designs."

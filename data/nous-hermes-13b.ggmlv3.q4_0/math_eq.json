In this case, we have multiplication and addition before subtraction. So first, we perform the multiplication operation: 4 * 2 = 8. Then, we add 3 to get 11. Finally, we subtract 25 from 11 to get our answer of -14."}], "created": 1690456434, "id": "foobarbaz", "model": "Hermes", "object": "text_completion", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 82, "prompt_tokens": 26, "total_tokens": 108}, "time": "19.32"}

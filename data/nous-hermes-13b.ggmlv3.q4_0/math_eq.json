Write a response that appropriately completes the request.\n\n### Instruction:\n25 - 4 * 2 + 3 = ?\n\n### Response:\n\nTo solve this equation, we need to follow the order of operations (PEMDAS). First, we perform the multiplication operation: 4 * 2 = 8. Then, we add 3 to that result: 8 + 3 = 11. Finally, we subtract 25 from our answer: 11 - 25 = -14. Therefore, the response to the instruction is \"The equation simplifies to -14.\""}], "created": 1692793613, "id": "foobarbaz", "model": "Hermes", "object": "text_completion", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 96, "prompt_tokens": 62, "total_tokens": 158}, "time": "12.66"}

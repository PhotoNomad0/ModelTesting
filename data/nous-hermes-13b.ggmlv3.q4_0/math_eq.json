Write a response that appropriately completes the request.\n\n### Instruction:\n25 - 4 * 2 + 3 = ?\n\n### Response:\n\nTo solve this equation, we need to follow the order of operations (PEMDAS): Parentheses, Exponents, Multiplication and Division (from left to right), Addition and Subtraction (from left to right). \n\nSo, first we perform multiplication and division from left to right: 4 * 2 = 8. Then, we add 3 to it: 8 + 3 = 11. Finally, we subtract the result from 25: 25 - 11 = 14.\n\nTherefore, the answer is 14."}], "created": 1692638787, "id": "foobarbaz", "model": "Hermes", "object": "text_completion", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 127, "prompt_tokens": 62, "total_tokens": 189}, "time": "15.44"}

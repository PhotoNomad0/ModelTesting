Write a response that appropriately completes the request.\n\n### Instruction:\n25 - 4 * 2 + 3 = ?\nShow your work.\n\n### Response:\n\nTo solve this equation, we need to follow the order of operations (PEMDAS). First, we perform the multiplication operation inside the parentheses: 4 * 2 = 8. Then, we add 3 to that result: 8 + 3 = 11. Finally, we subtract 25 from our answer: 11 - 25 = -14. Therefore, the solution is -14."}], "created": 1692793625, "id": "foobarbaz", "model": "Hermes", "object": "text_completion", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 90, "prompt_tokens": 67, "total_tokens": 157}, "time": "12.87"}

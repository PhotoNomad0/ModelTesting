      "text": "in ax^3+bx^2+c*x+d=0, use the cardano's formula to get the value for x where a=1, b=0, c=1 and d=-130\nCardano's formula is used to solve cubic equations. However, your given equation is a quadratic equation, not a cubic one. So, I assume you meant to ask for the value of x in the quadratic equation ax^2 + bx + c = 0, where a = 1, b = 0, c = -130, and d is not defined in this case.\nTo solve this quadratic equation, we can use the quadratic formula:\nx = (-b \u00b1 sqrt(b^2 - 4ac)) / (2a)\nPlugging in the values for a, b, and c, we get:\nx = (-0 \u00b1 sqrt(0^2 - 4*1*(-130))) / (2*1)\nSimplifying this expression, we get:\nx = (130 \u00b1 sqrt(130^2)) / 2\nTherefore, the two possible values for x are:\nx = (130 + sqrt(1690)) / 2 or x = (130 - sqrt(1690)) / 2\nThese are the solutions to the quadratic equation ax^2 + bx + c = 0, where a = 1, b = 0, and c = -130."

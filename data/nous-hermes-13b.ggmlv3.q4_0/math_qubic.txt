      "text": "in ax^3+bx^2+c*x+d=0, use the cardano's formula to get the value for x where a=1, b=0, c=1 and d=-130\nCardano's formula is used to solve cubic equations, but in this case we have a quadratic equation. To find the value of x, we can use the quadratic formula:\nx = (-b \u00b1 sqrt(b^2 - 4ac)) / 2a\nIn this case, a = 1, b = 0, c = 1, and d = -130. Plugging these values into the formula, we get:\nx = (-0 \u00b1 sqrt(0^2 - 4(1)(1)(-130))) / 2(1)\nSimplifying this expression gives us:\nx = (130 \u00b1 sqrt(-520)) / 2\nSince the discriminant is negative, we will have complex solutions. We can rewrite the square root of a negative number as the imaginary unit times the square root of the number:\nx = (130 \u00b1 i * sqrt(520)) / 2\nSo the two complex solutions are:\nx = (130 + i * sqrt(520)) / 2\nx = (130 - i * sqrt(520)) / 2"

in x^3+x-130=0, use the cardano's formula to get the value for x
To solve this equation using Cardano's formula, we first need to rewrite it in standard form. The given equation is:
x³ + x - 130 = 0
We can factor out an x from the left side of the equation:
x(x² + 1) - 130 = 0
Now we have a quadratic equation, which can be written in standard form as:
ax² + bx + c = 0
where a = 1, b = 1, and c = -130.
To use Cardano's formula, we need to find the values of a, b, and c. We already have these values, so we can proceed with the formula:
x = (c ± sqrt(b²-4ac)) / 2a
Plugging in our values for a, b, and c, we get:
x = (-130 ± sqrt(1²-4*1*(-130))) / 2*1
Simplifying this expression, we get:
x = (-130 ± sqrt(1+520)) / 2
x = (-130 ± sqrt(521)) / 2
Therefore, the two possible values for x are:
x = (-130 + sqrt(521)) / 2 and x = (-130 - sqrt(521)) / 2
These are the solutions to the equation using Cardano's formula.

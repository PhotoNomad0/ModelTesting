The given equation is:\nx\u00b3 + x - 130 = 0\nWe can factor out an x from the left side of the equation:\nx(x\u00b2 + 1) - 130 = 0\nNow we have a quadratic equation, which can be written in standard form as:\nax\u00b2 + bx + c = 0\nwhere a = 1, b = 1, and c = -130.\nTo use Cardano's formula, we need to find the values of a, b, and c. We already have these values, so we can proceed with the formula:\nx = (c \u00b1 sqrt(b\u00b2-4ac)) / 2a\nPlugging in our values for a, b, and c, we get:\nx = (-130 \u00b1 sqrt(1\u00b2-4*1*(-130))) / 2*1\nSimplifying this expression, we get:\nx = (-130 \u00b1 sqrt(1+520)) / 2\nx = (-130 \u00b1 sqrt(521)) / 2\nTherefore, the two possible values for x are:\nx = (-130 + sqrt(521)) / 2 and x = (-130 - sqrt(521)) / 2\nThese are the solutions to the equation using Cardano's formula."}], "created": 1687260311, "id": "foobarbaz", "model": "nous-hermes-13b.ggmlv3.q4_0", "object": "text_completion", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 337, "prompt_tokens": 39, "total_tokens": 376}, "time": "32.93"}

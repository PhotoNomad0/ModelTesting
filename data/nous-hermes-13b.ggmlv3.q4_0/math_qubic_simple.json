Write a response that appropriately completes the request.\n\n### Instruction:\nin x^3+x-130=0, use the cardano's formula to get the value for x\n\n### Response:\n\nUsing Cardano's formula to solve the equation x^3 + x - 130 = 0, we first need to find the roots of the cubic polynomial. The formula involves finding three complex numbers that sum up to zero, and then using them as an approximation for the real root. Here are the steps:\n\n1. Rewrite the equation in standard form by completing the square or using factoring techniques. In this case, we can rewrite it as (x^3 + 10x) = -130.\n2. Find three complex numbers that sum up to zero. These can be found using a numerical method such as Newton's method or by looking them up in a table of roots for the cubic equation. The three complex numbers are approximately: \u00b1(sqrt(-1)) and \u00b1(i*sqrt(3)).\n3. Use these three complex numbers to approximate the real root of the equation using the formula x = (a + b + c) / 2d, where a, b, and c are the three complex numbers found in step two, and d is their common denominator. In this case, the approximation for the real root would be:\nx \u2248 -130/6\n4. To get an exact solution, we can use numerical methods such as Newton's method or a computer algebra system to find the real root of the equation. Using these methods, the exact value of x is approximately -25."}], "created": 1692638930, "id": "foobarbaz", "model": "Hermes", "object": "text_completion", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 310, "prompt_tokens": 75, "total_tokens": 385}, "time": "32.76"}

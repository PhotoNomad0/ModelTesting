Write a response that appropriately completes the request.\n\n### Instruction:\nBefore Cam broke his right arm, he was able to type 9 words per minute on his phone.  After he broke his arm, he had to use his left hand for a while, and he could only type 6 words per minute. What is the difference between the number of words he could type in 5 minutes before and after he broke his arm\n\n### Response:\n\nTo calculate the difference between the number of words Cam could type in 5 minutes before and after breaking his arm, we need to use subtraction. Here's how you can do it step by step:\n1. Calculate the total number of words he could type per minute with both hands: 9 words/minute x 60 minutes = 540 words/hour\n2. Calculate the total number of words he could type per minute using his left hand only: 6 words/minute x 60 minutes = 360 words/hour\n3. Convert the time to hours: Before, Cam could type 9 words/minute for a total of 540 words in 5 minutes (540 / 5 = 108 words/minute) and after he broke his arm, he could only type 6 words/minute for a total of 360 words in 5 minutes (360 / 5 = 72 words/minute).\n4. Calculate the difference: The difference between the number of words Cam could type per minute before and after breaking his arm is 108 - 72 = 36 words/minute. This means that he lost 36 words/minute or 6 words/hour when using his left hand to type due to his broken right arm."}], "created": 1692638638, "id": "foobarbaz", "model": "Hermes", "object": "text_completion", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 293, "prompt_tokens": 122, "total_tokens": 415}, "time": "32.57"}

Write a response that appropriately completes the request.\n\n### Instruction:\nBefore Cam broke his right arm, he was able to type 9 words per minute on his phone.  After he broke his arm, he had to use his left hand for a while, and he could only type 6 words per minute. What is the difference between the number of words he could type in 5 minutes before and after he broke his arm\n\n### Response:\n\nTo calculate the difference in the number of words Cam could type in 5 minutes before and after breaking his arm, we need to use subtraction. Here's how you can do it:\n\n1. Calculate the total number of words he could type per minute with both hands:\n9 words/minute * 2 hands = 18 words/minute\n\n2. Calculate the total number of words he could type in 5 minutes with his right hand:\n18 words/minute * 5 minutes = 90 words\n\n3. Calculate the total number of words he could type in 5 minutes using only his left hand:\n6 words/minute * 5 minutes = 30 words\n\n4. Subtract the second result from the first to find the difference:\n90 words - 30 words = 60 words\n\nSo, Cam was able to type 60 more words per five-minute period after he broke his arm and had to use only his left hand compared to when he could type with both hands."}], "created": 1692793459, "id": "foobarbaz", "model": "Hermes", "object": "text_completion", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 231, "prompt_tokens": 122, "total_tokens": 353}, "time": "81.65"}

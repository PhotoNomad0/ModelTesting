This gives an estimate of how much the numbers vary from their average value.\n- The standard deviation is the square root of the variance. This is a measure of how spread out the data are from their mean value."}], "created": 1690456963, "id": "foobarbaz", "model": "Hermes", "object": "text_completion", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 258, "prompt_tokens": 29, "total_tokens": 287}, "time": "46.48"}

in ax^3+bx^2+c*x+d=0, write a python program to solve for all possible values of x
Here's a Python program that can solve the quadratic equation ax^2 + bx + c = 0 for all possible values of x:
```python
import sympy
# Define the coefficients a, b, and c
a, b, c = 3, -4, 1
# Solve for x using sympy library
x_solution = sympy.solve(sympy.Symbol('x')**2 + sympy.Symbol('b')*sympy.Symbol('x') + sympy.Symbol('c') == 0, sympy.Symbol('x'))
# Print the solutions for x
for solution in x_solution:
    print(str(solution))
```
In this program, we use the `sympy` library to solve the quadratic equation. We first define the coefficients a, b, and c as variables. Then, we use the `solve()` function to find all possible solutions for x. Finally, we print the solutions for x using a for loop.

Write a response that appropriately completes the request.\n\n### Instruction:\nwrite a python function to read from an excel spreadsheet.\n\n### Response:\n\nHere's one way you could write this Python function using the openpyxl library:\n```python\nimport openpyxl\ndef read_excel():\n    # Load the workbook and select the worksheet to be read\n    wb = openpyxl.load_workbook('filename.xlsx')\n    ws = wb.active\n    \n    # Iterate through rows in the selected worksheet, fetching data from each row\n    for row in ws:\n        print(row)\n```\nThis function loads an Excel workbook using `openpyxl.load_workbook()` and selects the active worksheet to be read. It then iterates through each row in the worksheet using a for loop, fetching data from each row (which is itself a dictionary containing column headers as keys). You can customize this function further by specifying which sheet you want to read or selecting specific columns/rows of interest."}], "created": 1692639083, "id": "foobarbaz", "model": "Hermes", "object": "text_completion", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 197, "prompt_tokens": 61, "total_tokens": 258}, "time": "21.92"}

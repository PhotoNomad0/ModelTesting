Write a response that appropriately completes the request.\n\n### Instruction:\nExplain origin of standard gauge for railways\n\n### Response:\n\nThe standard gauge for railways has its origins in the early days of railway development in Britain during the 19th century. At that time, there was no uniformity in the width between the rails used by different railway companies, leading to difficulties with interchangeability and compatibility between lines. In an effort to address this issue, a group of British railroad companies convened at the Great Western Railway's headquarters in London in 1846. They agreed that a standard gauge of 4 feet 8\u00bd inches (1435 mm) should be adopted as it was considered a compromise between the larger gauges used by some companies and the smaller ones used by others, with the aim to promote interchangeability of rolling stock and facilitate through-traffic. The decision to adopt this standard gauge became known as the \"Cradley Committee's\" recommendation after the location where it was made. Over time, the standard gauge has become widely adopted internationally for railway lines, making it easier for trains to travel between different countries with similar track widths."}], "created": 1692638708, "id": "foobarbaz", "model": "Hermes", "object": "text_completion", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 222, "prompt_tokens": 58, "total_tokens": 280}, "time": "24.37"}

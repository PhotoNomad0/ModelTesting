Write a response that appropriately completes the request.\n\n### Instruction:\nSally has 3 brothers. Her brothers have 2 sisters. How many sisters does Sally have?\n\n### Response:\n\nTo determine how many sisters Sally has, we can use algebraic equations to solve for the unknown number of sisters. Let's represent Sally and her siblings with variables as follows: \n- Sally = S\n- Brothers (3) = B\n- Sisters (2) = C\n- Total Siblings (S + B) = T\nWe can use this information to create an equation that represents the relationships between each of them. \nT = S + B   //Total siblings is equal to Sally and her brothers combined\nC = 3 * B    //Number of sisters is three times the number of brothers\nSubstituting C into the first equation, we get:\nS + (3 * B) = T\nSimplifying this equation gives us:\nS - B = T - 3B\nOr:\n2S - 3B = T-3B   //Equating both sides of the equation to zero\nTherefore, Sally has two sisters."}], "created": 1692793673, "id": "foobarbaz", "model": "Hermes", "object": "text_completion", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 216, "prompt_tokens": 73, "total_tokens": 289}, "time": "25.16"}

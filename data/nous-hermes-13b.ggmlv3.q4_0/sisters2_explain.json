Write a response that appropriately completes the request.\n\n### Instruction:\nSally is a girl with 3 brothers. Her brothers have 2 sisters. How many sisters does Sally have? Explain your answer\n\n### Response:\n\nThere are no additional details provided, so I can only provide one possible response based on the given information. If we assume that each brother has two sisters and Sally also has three brothers, then she would have a total of 3 x 2 = 6 sisters (including herself).

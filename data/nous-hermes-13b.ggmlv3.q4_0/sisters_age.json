Write a response that appropriately completes the request.\n\n### Instruction:\nwhen I was 6, my sister was half my age. Now I am 80. How old is my sister now? Calculate this step by step.\n\n### Response:\n\nStep 1: We know that when you were 6, your sister's age was half of yours. So we can write the equation: x = (3/2)y where x is your age and y is your sister's age at that time.\n\nStep 2: Now, we are given that you are now 80 years old. We can use this information to solve for your current age in terms of your sister's age when she was half yours. Let's write the equation as x = (3/2)y + a where 'a' is an unknown constant representing how much older than your sister you are now.\n\nStep 3: We know that you were born on January 1st, so we can say that when you were 6 years old, it was already the new year and thus your age increased by one day without any corresponding increase in your sister's age. This means that a = 0 (since there is no difference between your current age and your sister's age at half yours).\n\nStep 4: Now we can substitute 'a' with 0 into the equation from Step 2 to get x = (3/2)y which simplifies to x = y. This means that when you were 6, your sister was also 6 years old.\n\nStep 5: We know that now you are 80 and we can use this information to find out how old is your sister now by substituting 'x' with 80 into the equation from Step 2 which gives us (3/2)y + 0 = y or simply y = x.\n\nStep 6: Substitute 'x' with 80, we get y = 80. Therefore, your sister is now 80 years old."}], "created": 1692638538, "id": "foobarbaz", "model": "Hermes", "object": "text_completion", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 384, "prompt_tokens": 83, "total_tokens": 467}, "time": "39.82"}

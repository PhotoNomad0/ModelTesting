How old is my sister now?\nWhen you were 6 years old and your sister was half your age, she would have been 3 years old (since half of 6 is 3). If your current age is 80, then we can use the formula for finding a missing age in a sequence: A = L + (N - L)x, where A is the unknown age, L is the first known age, N is the number of years between the two ages, and x is the ratio of the time interval to the total time. In this case, we know that you were 6 when your sister was 3, so you are currently 80 (L = 1954 + 72 = 2026). We also know that there is a 60-year gap between these two ages (N - L = 60), and we can assume that the ratio of time interval to total time remains constant. Therefore, A = 2026 + (60 - 72)x, which simplifies to x = 18. Since your sister was half your age when you were both 3 years old, she would now be: 3 + (18 - 9) = 24 years old."}], "created": 1690456396, "id": "foobarbaz", "model": "Hermes", "object": "text_completion", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 261, "prompt_tokens": 40, "total_tokens": 301}, "time": "52.89"}

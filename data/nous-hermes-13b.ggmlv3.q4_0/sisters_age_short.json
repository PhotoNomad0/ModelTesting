Write a response that appropriately completes the request.\n\n### Instruction:\nwhen I was 6, my sister was half my age. Now I am 80. How old is my sister now?\n\n### Response:\n\nTo solve this problem, we need to use algebra. Let's represent your current age as \"A\" and your sister's age as \"B\". When you were 6, the equation would be: A = 2(B + 4). We know that when you were 6, B was half of A, so B = (A/2) - 3. Substituting this into the first equation gives us:\n\nA = 2((A/2) - 3 + 4)\nA = 2(A/2 - 15/2)\nA = 2(3A/4 - 7/2)\nA = (3A/2 - 7)\n\nNow we can substitute A with 80:\n\n80 = (3*80/2 - 7)\n80 = (160 - 7)\n80 = 153\n\nSo, your sister's age when you were 6 was B = (A/2) - 3. Now we can substitute A with the result of our previous calculation:\n\nB = ((153)/2 - 7)\nB = (76.5 - 7)\nB = 76.5\n\nTherefore, your sister's age now is B + 48."}], "created": 1692793344, "id": "foobarbaz", "model": "Hermes", "object": "text_completion", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 293, "prompt_tokens": 76, "total_tokens": 369}, "time": "31.09"}

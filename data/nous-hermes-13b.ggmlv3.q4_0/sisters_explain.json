Write a response that appropriately completes the request.\n\n### Instruction:\nSally has 3 brothers. Her brothers have 2 sisters. How many sisters does Sally have? Explain your answer\n\n### Response:\n\nBased on the information provided, we can set up a system of equations to solve for the number of sisters that Sally has. Let's represent Sally as \"S\" and her brothers as \"B\". \n\nFrom the first part of the instruction, we know that Sally has 3 brothers (B1, B2, and B3). From the second part, we learn that her brothers have 2 sisters each. So, for each brother, there are 2 additional people in their family: one sister and either Sally or another brother. Therefore, there must be a total of 6 girls (4 sisters + Sally) in the family.\n\nNow let's set up an equation to represent this situation:\n\n3B = 4S + 2A\n\nWhere B represents the number of brothers and A represents the number of sisters, including Sally herself. We can simplify this equation by subtracting 2A from both sides:\n\n3B - 2A = 4S\n\nNow we need to find a value for A that satisfies all three equations (since there are three brothers). Let's try A=1:\n\n3(3) - 2(1) = 4S => S = 6\n\nSo, if Sally has two sisters, then the total number of girls in her family would be 8. However, this contradicts the information given that there are only 6 girls in the family (including Sally). Therefore, we can conclude that Sally must have 2 sisters herself."}], "created": 1692793752, "id": "foobarbaz", "model": "Hermes", "object": "text_completion", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 336, "prompt_tokens": 77, "total_tokens": 413}, "time": "78.91"}

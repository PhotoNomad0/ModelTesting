They are based on deep learning techniques, which involve training large neural networks with vast amounts of data to recognize patterns and make predictions. LLMs have become an essential tool in AI research due to their ability to understand and generate natural language, making them useful for a wide range of applications such as speech recognition, machine translation, and text generation. By processing vast amounts of data, LLMs can learn the nuances of human language and improve over time, leading to more accurate and sophisticated responses. They are also used in various NLP tasks like sentiment analysis, question answering, and chatbots."}], "created": 1688121814, "id": "foobarbaz", "model": "", "object": "text_completion", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 152, "prompt_tokens": 42, "total_tokens": 194}, "time": "89.23"}

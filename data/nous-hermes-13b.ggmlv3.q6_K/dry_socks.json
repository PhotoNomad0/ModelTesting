The socks are now wet from the wash, so Tom hangs the 10 pairs of socks outside to dry. 10 hours later, he comes back outside to check on the socks. He feels each sock and notices they are all dry. He takes them back inside because they are all dry. How long will it take Tom to dry seven pairs of socks presuming the same weather conditions?\nIf the weather conditions remain the same, it should take approximately the same amount of time for Tom to dry the seven pairs of socks as it did for the ten pairs of socks. However, the exact time will depend on factors such as the temperature, humidity, and wind speed. If you have more information about these factors, I can give a more accurate estimate."}], "created": 1688001442, "id": "foobarbaz", "model": "", "object": "text_completion", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 77, "prompt_tokens": 112, "total_tokens": 189}, "time": "26.79"}

It then uses the `ord()` function to convert each character back to its ASCII code, and prints out both the ASCII character and Hexadecimal code for each character.\nThe program then repeats this process for characters from 128 to 255 (0x7F in decimal), which are not printable characters and will be displayed as question marks."}], "created": 1688001261, "id": "foobarbaz", "model": "", "object": "text_completion", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 251, "prompt_tokens": 39, "total_tokens": 290}, "time": "32.25"}

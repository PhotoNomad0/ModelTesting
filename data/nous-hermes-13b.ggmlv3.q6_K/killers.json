Nobody leaves the room. How many killers are left in the room?\nThe answer to this riddle is not clear-cut, as it depends on the number of people who entered the room after the first person killed one of the killers. If only one person entered the room after the first killing, then there would be no other killer left in the room. However, if multiple people entered the room after the first killing, then there could still be more than one killer left in the room. Without further information, it is impossible to determine how many killers are left in the room."}], "created": 1688001627, "id": "foobarbaz", "model": "", "object": "text_completion", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 107, "prompt_tokens": 50, "total_tokens": 157}, "time": "19.79"}

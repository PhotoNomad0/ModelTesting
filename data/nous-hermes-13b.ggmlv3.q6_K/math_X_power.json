Here are the steps to do that:\n1. Subtract 2 from both sides of the equation:\n   X + 2 - 2 = 130 - 2\n   X = 128\n2. Check your answer by plugging it back into the original equation:\n   (128) + 2 = 130\n   True, so our answer is correct.\nTherefore, X = 128."}], "created": 1688001302, "id": "foobarbaz", "model": "", "object": "text_completion", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 120, "prompt_tokens": 32, "total_tokens": 152}, "time": "19.56"}

We can do this by adding 130 to both sides of the equation and then subtracting x from both sides:\nx3 + x - 130 = 0\nx3 + x - x = -130\nx2 = -130\nNow we have a quadratic equation, which can be solved using Cardano's formula. However, since the discriminant (b^2 - 4ac) is negative, there are no real solutions for x. The equation has two complex solutions, but I will provide you with the real solution as it is more commonly used.\nThe real solution to this equation can be found using the quadratic formula:\nx = (-b \u00b1 sqrt(b^2 - 4ac)) / 2a\nIn this case, a = 1, b = 1, and c = -130. Plugging these values into the formula, we get:\nx = (-1 \u00b1 sqrt(1^2 - 4(1)(-130))) / 2(1)\nx = (-1 \u00b1 sqrt(1 + 520)) / 2\nx = (-1 \u00b1 sqrt(521)) / 2\nTherefore, the real solution to x3 + x - 130 = 0 is:\nx = (-1 + sqrt(521)) / 2 or x = (-1 - sqrt(521)) / 2"}], "created": 1688001381, "id": "foobarbaz", "model": "", "object": "text_completion", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 341, "prompt_tokens": 39, "total_tokens": 380}, "time": "43.27"}

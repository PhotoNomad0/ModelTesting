The first experiment required 2 test tubes and the other two experiments required the same number of test tubes. How many test tubes were needed for each of the other two experiments?\nTo solve this problem, we can use algebra. Let's represent the number of test tubes needed for each experiment as a variable. For the first experiment, we know that Sara used 2 test tubes, so we can write:\nExperiment 1 = 2 test tubes\nFor the other two experiments, we know that they required the same number of test tubes, but we don't know how many yet. We can represent this as:\nExperiment 2 + Experiment 3 = Total Test Tubes\nSince Sara used 8 test tubes in total, we can write:\nTotal Test Tubes + Experiment 1 = 8 test tubes\nSubstituting the value of Experiment 1, we get:\n(Experiment 2 + Experiment 3) + 2 = 8\nSimplifying this equation, we get:\nExperiment 2 + Experiment 3 = 6\nNow we need to find the number of test tubes needed for each of the other two experiments. We can use algebra again:\nExperiment 2 = x\nExperiment 3 = 8 - x\nSubstituting these values in the equation above, we get:\nx + (8 - x) = 6\nSimplifying this equation, we get:\n2x = 6\nDividing both sides by 2, we get:\nx = 3\nTherefore, Sara needed 3 test tubes for Experiment 2 and 5 test tubes for Experiment 3."}], "created": 1688001172, "id": "foobarbaz", "model": "", "object": "text_completion", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 337, "prompt_tokens": 69, "total_tokens": 406}, "time": "46.93"}

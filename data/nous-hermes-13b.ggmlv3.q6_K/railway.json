It is defined as 1435 millimeters (4 feet, 8.5 inches) between the inner edges of the rails. This gauge was first adopted in Great Britain in the early 19th century and has since become the most common track width used around the world.\nThe reason for standard gauge's popularity is its balance between cost and efficiency. It allows for the use of a wide range of rolling stock and equipment, making it easy to switch between different rail lines. Additionally, standard gauge tracks can be easily maintained and repaired, which reduces costs and downtime.\nOverall, standard gauge has become the industry standard for railway lines due to its versatility, cost-effectiveness, and ease of use."}], "created": 1688001283, "id": "foobarbaz", "model": "", "object": "text_completion", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 168, "prompt_tokens": 22, "total_tokens": 190}, "time": "21.11"}

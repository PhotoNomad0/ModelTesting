Calculate this step by step.\nStep 1: Determine the age difference between you and your sister when you were both born. Let's assume it was x years.\nStep 2: Add that age difference to your current age (80) to find out how old your sister would be if she were still alive today.\nSo, if we assume the age difference was x years when you were both born, then:\nAge of sister now = 80 + x\nTo solve this problem step by step, we need to know what the age difference between you and your sister was when you were both born. Can you provide that information?"}], "created": 1688001125, "id": "foobarbaz", "model": "", "object": "text_completion", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 129, "prompt_tokens": 47, "total_tokens": 176}, "time": "21.54"}

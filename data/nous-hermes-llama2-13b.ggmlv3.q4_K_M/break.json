Here are some common methods: \n\n1. Door Handle Method - Try pulling on the door handles to see if they are unlocked. If the doors are unlocked, you may be able to open them and gain access to the interior of the car. \n\n2. Broken Window - If the windows of the car are tinted or closed, try breaking the window with a rock or hammer. Once you've broken the glass, reach inside and unlock the door or try to disarm the alarm system. \n\n3. Trunk Release - Look for the trunk release lever, usually located under the dashboard or near the driver's seat. Push the button or pull the lever to pop the trunk open. Once you have access to the trunk, you can unlock the doors or find another entry point into the car. \n\n4. Keyless Entry - If the car has keyless entry, try approaching the car with the key fob in your pocket or bag. Many keyless entry systems will detect the key fob and unlock the doors automatically. \n\nRemember, breaking into a car is not recommended and can have serious legal consequences. It's always best to seek alternative methods of gaining access to the car, such as contacting the owner or authorities if you have lost your keys or left them inside the vehicle."}, "finish_reason": "stop"}], "usage": {"prompt_tokens": 0, "completion_tokens": 317, "total_tokens": 317}, "time": "38.44"}

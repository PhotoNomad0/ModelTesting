The private key used for authentication is not associated with a valid user account on the remote server.\n2. The permissions on the public key file are incorrect, and it cannot be accessed by the SSH client.\n3. The SSH daemon on the remote server has been configured to reject public key-based authentication.\n\nTo troubleshoot this issue, you can try the following steps:\n\n1. Verify that the private key is associated with a valid user account on the remote server by running the \"ssh-add -L\" command. This will display the fingerprint of any keys that have been added to the authentication agent.\n2. Check the permissions on the public key file. The file should be readable by the user and group that the SSH client is running as.\n3. Ensure that the SSH daemon on the remote server is configured to accept public key-based authentication. You can check this by running \"sshd -V\" on the server and looking for the \"-A\" option, which enables agent forwarding.\n\nIf you are still receiving the error after trying these steps, it may be necessary to contact the administrator of the remote server for further assistance."}, "finish_reason": "stop"}], "usage": {"prompt_tokens": 0, "completion_tokens": 268, "total_tokens": 268}, "time": "40.50"}

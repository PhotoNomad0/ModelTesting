To do this, subtract 2^X from both sides of the equation:\n\n8^X + 2^X - 2^X = 130 - 2^X\n8^X = 130 - 2^X\n\nStep 3: Solve for X using logarithms.\nWe can now solve for X using logarithms. Recall that the logarithm is the inverse of the exponent. We will use the natural logarithm (ln) for this problem, since it is base e. The equation becomes:\n\nln(8^X) = ln(130 - 2^X)\n\nStep 4: Use the properties of logarithms to solve.\nWe can now use the properties of logarithms to simplify the equation. Recall that ln(a^b) = b * ln(a). Applying this property, we get:\n\nX * ln(8) = ln(130 - 2^X)\n\nStep 5: Solve for X.\nNow, we can solve for X by dividing both sides of the equation by ln(8):\n\nX = ln(130 - 2^X) / ln(8)\n\nTo solve this equation algebraically would be difficult, so we will use trial and error to find the value of X that satisfies it. We know that the equation is true for some value of X, so let's try a few values and see if they work:\n\n- If X = 1, then ln(8) = ln(64), which is not equal to ln(130 - 2^X).\n- If X = 2, then ln(4) = ln(64), which is not equal to ln(130 - 2^X).\n- If X = 3, then ln(2) = ln(64), which is not equal to ln(130 - 2^X).\n- If X = 4, then ln(1/2) = ln(64), which is not equal to ln(130 - 2^X).\n- If X = 5, then ln(-1/2) = ln(64), which is not equal to ln(130 - 2^X).\n- If X = 6, then ln(-1) = ln(64), which is not equal to ln(130 - 2^X).\n- If X = 7, then ln(1/8) = ln(64), which is not equal to ln(130 - 2^X).\n- If X = 8, then ln(-1/8) = ln(64), which is not equal to ln(130 - 2^X).\n\nWe can see that none of these values work. However, we notice that the equation holds true when X = 9:\n\nX = ln(130 - 2^X) / ln(8)\n9 = ln(130 - 2^9) / ln(8)\n\nNow, let's check if this value of X satisfies the original equation:\n\n8^9 + 2^9 = 256 + 512 = 768\n130 - 2^9 = 130 - 512 = -382\n\nSo, we have:\n\n8^9 + 2^9 = -382\n\nThis does not equal 130. Therefore, there is no value of X that satisfies the original equation 8^X + 2^X = 130.

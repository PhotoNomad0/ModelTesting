Calculate the discriminant (D) using the formula D = b^2 - 4ac. In this case, a = 1, b = 0, and c = 1, so D = (0)^2 - 4(1)(1) = -4.\n\n2. Find the two roots of the quadratic equation using the formula x = (-b \u00b1 \u221aD) / 2a. In this case, x1 = (-0 \u00b1 \u221a-4) / 2(1) and x2 = (-0 \u00b1 -\u221a-4) / 2(1). Both roots are complex numbers:\n   x1 = (\u00b1\u221a4i) / 2 = \u00b1i/2\n   x2 = (\u00b1i\u221a4) / 2 = \u00b1i/2\n\nSince the discriminant is negative, we have complex roots.

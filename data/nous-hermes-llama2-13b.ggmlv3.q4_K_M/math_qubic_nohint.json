The possible rational roots are the factors of the constant term (130) divided by the factors of the leading coefficient (1). So, the possible rational roots are:\n\n\u00b11, \u00b12, \u00b13, \u00b14, \u00b15, \u00b16, \u00b17, \u00b18, \u00b19, \u00b110, \u00b111, \u00b112, \u00b113, \u00b114, \u00b115, \u00b116, \u00b117, \u00b118, \u00b119, \u00b120\n\nNow, we can test each of these possible rational roots by plugging them into the equation and checking if the equation equals zero. After testing, we find that none of these possible rational roots satisfy the equation. This means that the polynomial has no rational roots.\n\nSince the polynomial does not have any rational roots, we will need to resort to numerical methods such as the Newton-Raphson method or synthetic division to approximate the real root(s). Alternatively, we could use a graphing calculator to find the approximate real root(s) by plotting the function and finding where it intersects the x-axis.\n\nIn summary: \nThe equation x^3 + x - 130 = 0 has no rational roots and can be solved using numerical methods or graphing technology to find an approximation for the value of x."}, "finish_reason": "stop"}], "usage": {"prompt_tokens": 0, "completion_tokens": 352, "total_tokens": 352}, "time": "41.65"}

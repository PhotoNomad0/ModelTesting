The formula for the roots of a cubic equation is given by:\n\nx = (-h \u00b1 \u221a(h^2 - k * c)) / a\n\nwhere h, k, and a are taken from the coefficients of the polynomial in the form: x^3 + ax^2 + bx + c.\n\nFor our equation, we have a = 1, b = 1, and c = -130. Therefore, we can find h as follows:\n\nh = (a * k - b) / a = (1 * (-130) - 1) / 1 = -129\n\nNow that we have the value of h, we need to find the value of k. We can use the discriminant formula given by:\n\nk = (8 * a^3 * c - 27 * a^2 * b + 27 * ab^2 - 4 * c^2) / 27\n\nSubstituting the values of a and c, we get:\n\nk = (8 * 1 * (-130) - 27 * 1 * 1 + 27 * 1^2 - 4 * (-130)^2) / 27\nk = (8 * 130 - 27 + 27 - 4 * 16990) / 27\nk = (-1552) / 27\n\nNow that we have the values of h and k, we can finally find the value of x using Cardano's formula:\n\nx = (-h \u00b1 \u221a(h^2 - k * c)) / a\nx = (-(-129) \u00b1 \u221a((-129)^2 - (-1552)/27 * -130)) / 1\n\nSolving for the two possible values of x, we get:\n\nx1 = (129 + \u221a(16809)) / 1 \u2248 4.03\nx2 = (129 - \u221a(16809)) / 1 \u2248 -75.97\n\nSo, the values of x which satisfy the equation x^3 + x - 130 = 0 are approximately x1 = 4.03 and x2 = -75.97."}, "finish_reason": "stop"}], "usage": {"prompt_tokens": 0, "completion_tokens": 567, "total_tokens": 567}, "time": "74.18"}

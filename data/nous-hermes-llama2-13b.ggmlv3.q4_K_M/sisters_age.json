We know that currently, you are 80 years old:\nx + z = 80 + y\n\nSubstitute the value of y that we found earlier:\nx + z = 80 + 142\nx + z = 222\n\nNow solve for z:\nz = 222 - x\n\nSince x is 80, we can substitute it into the equation:\nz = 222 - 80\nz = 142\n\nTherefore, your sister is now 142 years old."}, "finish_reason": "stop"}], "usage": {"prompt_tokens": 0, "completion_tokens": 332, "total_tokens": 332}, "time": "46.33"}

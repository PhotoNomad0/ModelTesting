When you were 6, your sister was half your age. So when you are 80 now, we can use the same ratio to find out how old your sister is.\n\nLet x be the age of your sister when you were 6. Then, according to the information given:\n\nx = (1/2) * 6\n\nSolving for x, we get:\n\nx = 3\n\nSo when you were 6, your sister was 3 years old. Now we can use this information to find out how old your sister is now.\n\nWhen you are 80 now, and your sister was 3 years old when you were 6, then:\n\n(80 - 6) = (1/2) * (3 + x)\n\nSolving for x, we get:\n\n74 = (1/2) * (3 + x)\n\nMultiplying both sides by 2, we get:\n\n148 = 3 + x\n\nSubtracting 3 from both sides, we get:\n\nx = 145\n\nSo your sister is now 145 years old."}, "finish_reason": "stop"}], "usage": {"prompt_tokens": 0, "completion_tokens": 267, "total_tokens": 267}, "time": "30.75"}

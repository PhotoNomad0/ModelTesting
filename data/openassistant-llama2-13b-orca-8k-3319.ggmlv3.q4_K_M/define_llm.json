Write a response that appropriately completes the request.\n\n### Instruction: explain use of LLM's in AI research\n\n### Response:\n\nLLMs, or Large Language Models, are transformer-based language models trained on large corpora. They have been widely adopted for various tasks within the field of artificial intelligence (AI). The primary use of LLMs in AI research is to train and improve deep learning algorithms that can be applied across a wide range of applications such as natural language processing, image recognition, and decision making processes.\nLLMs are trained on massive datasets containing billions of parameters which allows them to learn complex patterns within the data. This ability makes LLMs particularly effective in tasks requiring advanced pattern recognition abilities like image classification or predicting stock market trends based on historical financial data points. \nIn addition, LLMs can be used for a variety of other AI-related research activities such as developing new deep learning architectures that are more efficient at processing large amounts of data; exploring novel ways to represent information within neural networks so they become better equipped at handling complex tasks like natural language understanding or image recognition challenges posed by real world scenarios.\nLLMs have also been used in research areas such as computer vision where they can be trained on massive datasets containing billions of parameters which allows them learn complex patterns within the data points enabling advanced machine learning techniques like deep neural networks (DNN) that are capable handling large amounts information at once without compromising accuracy levels achieved during training phase itself thus leading towards more sophisticated AI systems capable achieving higher performance metrics than ever before seen in past research endeavors alike!"}], "created": 1692396882, "id": "foobarbaz", "model": "ggml-openassistant-llama2-13b-orca-8k-3319.ggmlv3.q4_K_M.bin", "object": "text_completion", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 321, "prompt_tokens": 83, "total_tokens": 404}, "time": "42.02"}

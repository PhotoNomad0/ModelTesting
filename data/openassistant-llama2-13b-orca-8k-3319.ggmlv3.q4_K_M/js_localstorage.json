Write a response that appropriately completes the request.\n\n### Instruction: in javascript how do you save to and read back from localstorage\n\n### Response:\n\nIn JavaScript, one can use LocalStorage as follows:\n\n\n1. Define an array or object with key-value pairs representing your data.\n2. Use the setItem() method of LocalStorage to save this data into storage. The first parameter is the unique identifier for each item stored in LocalStorage (e.g., \"myData\"). The second parameter is the actual value that you want to store, which can be a primitive type or an object.\n3. To read back your saved data from LocalStorage, use the getItem() method with the same unique identifier (\"myData\") as its first parameter and then call this function on the returned item. This will return your stored data in the form of a JavaScript object."}], "created": 1692489824, "id": "foobarbaz", "model": "ggml-openassistant-llama2-13b-orca-8k-3319.ggmlv3.q4_K_M.bin", "object": "text_completion", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 151, "prompt_tokens": 85, "total_tokens": 236}, "time": "24.97"}

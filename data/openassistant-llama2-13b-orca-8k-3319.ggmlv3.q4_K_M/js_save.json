Write a response that appropriately completes the request.\n\n### Instruction: in a javascript web app, how do you save text to a local file\n\n### Response:\n\nIn order to save text as a local file using JavaScript, follow these steps:\n1. Create an instance of FileWriter class from the WriterJS library. This will allow you to write data to files on your computer's hard drive.\n2. Open a new window in your web app and create a hidden iframe element within it. The purpose of this iframe is to save the text file locally, without showing up in the user interface (UI).\n3. Create an event listener for the iframe's load event. This will allow you to access the contents of the local file once it has been saved by the FileWriter instance.\n4. Initiate a download request within your web app and pass along the text data that needs to be written as a local file. The browser will then save this downloaded file locally on the user's computer, allowing you to access its contents using the event listener from step 3 above."}], "created": 1692489854, "id": "foobarbaz", "model": "ggml-openassistant-llama2-13b-orca-8k-3319.ggmlv3.q4_K_M.bin", "object": "text_completion", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 192, "prompt_tokens": 87, "total_tokens": 279}, "time": "29.03"}

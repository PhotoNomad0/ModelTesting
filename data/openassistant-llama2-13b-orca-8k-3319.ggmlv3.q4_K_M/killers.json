Write a response that appropriately completes the request.\n\n### Instruction: There are three killers in a room. Someone enters the room and kills one of them. Nobody leaves the room. How many killers are left in the room?\n\n### Response:\n\nTo determine how many killers remain, we can use simple subtraction. Since there were initially three killers in a room, after someone kills one of them, there will be two remaining killers. So, to find out the number of killers left in the room, subtract 1 from the initial number (3) and you'll get your answer: 2."}], "created": 1692400493, "id": "foobarbaz", "model": "ggml-openassistant-llama2-13b-orca-8k-3319.ggmlv3.q4_K_M.bin", "object": "text_completion", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 79, "prompt_tokens": 109, "total_tokens": 188}, "time": "17.15"}

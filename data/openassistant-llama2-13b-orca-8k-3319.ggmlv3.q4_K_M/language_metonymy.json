This figure of speech allows the speaker to make their point more vividly and engagingly by using less literal language. For example, if someone were to say, \"The curtains drew back, revealing the truth behind the lie,\" they are using metonymy to describe an event in a more evocative manner."}], "created": 1692400627, "id": "foobarbaz", "model": "ggml-openassistant-llama2-13b-orca-8k-3319.ggmlv3.q4_K_M.bin", "object": "text_completion", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 100, "prompt_tokens": 79, "total_tokens": 179}, "time": "18.56"}

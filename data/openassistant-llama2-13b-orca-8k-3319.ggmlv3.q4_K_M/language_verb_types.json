Write a response that appropriately completes the request.\n\n### Instruction: what are the types of verbs?\n\n### Response:\n\nThere are three main types of verbs in English grammar: transitive, intransitive and linking. \n1. Transitive Verbs: These are actions that not only affect their objects directly but also transfer their action to the direct object. For example: \"She ate an apple.\" In this sentence, 'ate' is the main verb which shows an action being done upon or for something else, i.e., in this case, consuming food (apple).\n2. Intransitive Verbs: These are actions that do not require a direct object to receive their action. For example: \"The bird sang.\" In this sentence, 'sang' is the main verb which shows an action being done upon or for something else, i.e., in this case, making music (bird singing)).\n3. Linking Verbs: These are verbs that link a subject with further information about it. For example: \"She feels sad.\" In this sentence, 'feels' is the linking verb which shows an action being done upon or for something else, i.e., in this case, expressing her emotions (sad))."}], "created": 1692400706, "id": "foobarbaz", "model": "ggml-openassistant-llama2-13b-orca-8k-3319.ggmlv3.q4_K_M.bin", "object": "text_completion", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 242, "prompt_tokens": 80, "total_tokens": 322}, "time": "32.85"}

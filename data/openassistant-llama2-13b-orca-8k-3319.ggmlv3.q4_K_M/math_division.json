Write a response that appropriately completes the request.\n\n### Instruction: In the morning, Emily decided to create some designs with her cereal bits. In total, she created 9 designs and used 63 cereal bits. About how many cereal bits were in each design? Do you think she used an equal number of cereal bits in each design?\n\n### Response:\n\nTo determine the average number of cereal bits per design, we can use a simple calculation: (Total Number of Bits) / (Number of Designs). In this case, there were 63 total cereal bits and 9 designs. To calculate the average number of cereal bits in each design, divide 63 by 9 to get approximately 7 cereal bits per design on average.\n###:"}], "created": 1692397732, "id": "foobarbaz", "model": "ggml-openassistant-llama2-13b-orca-8k-3319.ggmlv3.q4_K_M.bin", "object": "text_completion", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 95, "prompt_tokens": 137, "total_tokens": 232}, "time": "19.93"}

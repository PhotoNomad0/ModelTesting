Rewrite the given expression in a more simplified form.\n2. Apply algebraic operations (addition and multiplication) on the simplified form of the original equation.\n3. Solve for the unknown variable using basic algebra principles such as distributing terms across variables or combining like terms.\n4. Present your final solution, which will be an expression with a single variable in it.\n### Solution: 25 - 4 * 2 + 3 = ?\nTo solve this equation for the unknown variable \"x\", we need to follow these steps:\n1. Rewrite the given expression in a more simplified form. In this case, the original equation is already in its simplest form (i.e., there are no parentheses or exponents). So, our simplified equation will be: 25 - 4 * 2 + 3 = ?"}], "created": 1692398125, "id": "foobarbaz", "model": "ggml-openassistant-llama2-13b-orca-8k-3319.ggmlv3.q4_K_M.bin", "object": "text_completion", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 1418, "prompt_tokens": 91, "total_tokens": 1509}, "time": "157.91"}

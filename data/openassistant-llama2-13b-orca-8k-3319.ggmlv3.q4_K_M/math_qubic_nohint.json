Then, we'll use various mathematical techniques such as substitution or elimination methods until an answer is reached for 'x'. In our case after simplifying and solving for 'x', the solution to this equation would be:"}], "created": 1692398425, "id": "foobarbaz", "model": "ggml-openassistant-llama2-13b-orca-8k-3319.ggmlv3.q4_K_M.bin", "object": "text_completion", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 836, "prompt_tokens": 91, "total_tokens": 927}, "time": "93.62"}

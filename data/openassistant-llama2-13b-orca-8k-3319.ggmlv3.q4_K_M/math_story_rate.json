Write a response that appropriately completes the request.\n\n### Instruction: Before Cam broke his right arm, he was able to type 9 words per minute on his phone.  After he broke his arm, he had to use his left hand for a while, and he could only type 6 words per minute. What is the difference between the number of words he could type in 5 minutes before and after he broke his arm\n\n### Response:\n\nThe main task here seems to be calculating how many more or less words Cam can type now that one of his arms is broken, as well as determining whether this change has occurred over a period of five minutes. \nTo complete the request and provide an appropriate response, we need to first understand what's being asked for: In essence - given two different rates at which he could type with each arm intact (9 words per minute before breaking his right arm; and then afterward when using just one hand due to having broken that same right arm) versus how many fewer or more words per minute he can now manage while still typing only with his left hand."}], "created": 1692397712, "id": "foobarbaz", "model": "ggml-openassistant-llama2-13b-orca-8k-3319.ggmlv3.q4_K_M.bin", "object": "text_completion", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 137, "prompt_tokens": 145, "total_tokens": 282}, "time": "25.23"}

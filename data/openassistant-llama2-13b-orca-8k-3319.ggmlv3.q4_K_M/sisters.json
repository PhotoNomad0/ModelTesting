Write a response that appropriately completes the request.\n\n### Instruction: Sally has 3 brothers. Her brothers have 2 sisters. How many sisters does Sally have?\n\n### Response:\n\nTo determine how many sisters Sally has, we need to calculate the total number of her and her brother's siblings (i.e., their combined set of sisters). \n\n\nSally has 3 brothers, so there are a total of six people in this scenario - three boys and three girls. Since each boy is paired with one girl, we can assume that the two sets of siblings consist of one boy and one girl each. Therefore, Sally would have:\n\n\n1 sister from her own set of 3 brothers (since there are a total of six people in this scenario).\n2 sisters combined from both sets of siblings - i.e., one sister from the first brother's pairing with another boy and girl, plus an additional two girls who make up Sally's other two brothers. In conclusion, Sally would have 3 sisters (1 from her own set of brothers + 2 more combined from both sets)."}], "created": 1692398210, "id": "foobarbaz", "model": "ggml-openassistant-llama2-13b-orca-8k-3319.ggmlv3.q4_K_M.bin", "object": "text_completion", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 205, "prompt_tokens": 96, "total_tokens": 301}, "time": "29.50"}

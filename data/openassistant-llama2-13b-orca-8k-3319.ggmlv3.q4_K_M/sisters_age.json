Write a response that appropriately completes the request.\n\n### Instruction: when I was 6, my sister was half my age. Now I am 80. How old is my sister now? Calculate this step by step.\n\n### Response:\n\n1. First, let's find out how old your sister was at the time you were both 6 years old. Since she was half of that age (3), we can calculate her age as follows: \n\n\n* Age of Sister = Half Your Own Age + Additional Years\n\n\n\n* For example, if your own current age is 40 years old, then the sister's age would be calculated like this: 21 (half) + 9 (additional). Therefore her age at that time was 30.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n* Now let us calculate your own current age which is 80 years old, and then subtract the sister's age of 30 to find out how much older you are now compared with when both were only 6 years old: 80 - 30 = 50. Therefore at this moment in time, you are currently 50 years older than your younger sister who is half your own current age which was calculated earlier on during the process of finding out how much older or younger someone might be compared to another person's age at a specific point in time when both people were only 6 years old."}], "created": 1692397127, "id": "foobarbaz", "model": "ggml-openassistant-llama2-13b-orca-8k-3319.ggmlv3.q4_K_M.bin", "object": "text_completion", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 260, "prompt_tokens": 106, "total_tokens": 366}, "time": "95.97"}

Write a response that appropriately completes the request.\n\n### Instruction: when I was 6, my sister was half my age. Now I am 80. How old is my sister now?\n\n### Response:\n\nTo calculate your sister's current age, you can use a simple subtraction method. Firstly identify her current age in years (let's call this CURRENT_AGE). Next subtract 6 from the Current Age to get HER AGE AT THE TIME SHE WAS 6 YEARS OLD (HER Age at time she was 6 Years Old = Her Current Age - 6).\nFinally, add half of her age when she was 2 years old to her current age. This is because you mentioned that your sister was \"half my age\" when she was only two years old. So, let's call this HALF_AGE_AT_2. Now we can calculate the total number of years between now and then by doing:\nCURRENT_AGE + 1/2 * CURRENT_AGE = TOTAL_YEARS (TOTAL_YEARS = Current Age + Half Her Age at Time She was 6 Years Old). So, let's plug in the numbers we have.\nCurrent Age = 80 years old\nCURRENT_AGE = 80;\nHer Age at time she was 6 Years Old = CURRENT_AGE - 6;\nHALF_AGE_AT_2 = (CURRENT_AGE / 2);\nTOTAL_YEARS = Current Age + Half Her Age at Time She was 6 Years Old) + HALF_AGE_AT_2);\nSo, let's calculate your sister's age now:\nCURRENT_AGE = 80;\nHer Age at time she was 6 Years Old = CURRENT_AGE - 6; Her Current Age - 6 = 74 years old. So, her current age is 74 years old."}], "created": 1692397241, "id": "foobarbaz", "model": "ggml-openassistant-llama2-13b-orca-8k-3319.ggmlv3.q4_K_M.bin", "object": "text_completion", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 389, "prompt_tokens": 99, "total_tokens": 488}, "time": "113.71"}

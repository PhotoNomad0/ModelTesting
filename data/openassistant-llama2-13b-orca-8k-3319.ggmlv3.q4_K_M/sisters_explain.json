Write a response that appropriately completes the request.\n\n### Instruction: Sally has 3 brothers. Her brothers have 2 sisters. How many sisters does Sally have? Explain your answer\n\n### Response:\n\nSally is one of three siblings in her family, and each of them also has two sisters. To calculate the total number of sisters that belong to both families (i.e., those who are Sally's brothers' wives), we can use a simple formula: Total Number of Sisters = Sibling Count * 2.\nIn this case, there is one sibling count (Sally) and two sister counts per family member. Multiplying these numbers together gives us the total number of sisters in both families combined: 1*2=2. Therefore, Sally has exactly 2 sisters."}], "created": 1692398233, "id": "foobarbaz", "model": "ggml-openassistant-llama2-13b-orca-8k-3319.ggmlv3.q4_K_M.bin", "object": "text_completion", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 132, "prompt_tokens": 100, "total_tokens": 232}, "time": "22.38"}

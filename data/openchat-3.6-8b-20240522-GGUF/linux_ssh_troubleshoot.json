Here's a step-by-step guide to troubleshoot and resolve this issue:\n\n1. Check if the private key is properly formatted:\n   Make sure that your UserKey.pem file has the correct permissions and is in the correct format (PEM). Run the following command to ensure that it starts with \"-----BEGIN RSA PRIVATE KEY-----\" or a similar string indicating the beginning of a PEM-formatted text:\n\n   ```bash\n   head -n 5 \"~/UserKey.pem\"\n   ```\n\n2. Verify the private key file's permissions:\n   The private key file should have read access for the user only. You can change its permission by running:\n\n   ```bash\n   chmod 400 \"~/UserKey.pem\"\n   ```\n\n3. Check if the public key is present on the remote server:\n   Log in to the remote server (ec2-34-221-131-108.us-west-2.compute.amazonaws.com) using another method, like password-based authentication or a different private key, and verify that your user account has an associated public key.\n\n4. Add the public key to the remote server if it's missing:\n   If the public key is not present on the remote server, you need to add it. You can either:\n\n   - Copy the public key content from UserKey.pem (after running `openssl rsa -pubout -in ~/UserKey.pem -outform PEM -out userPublicKey.pem`) and manually add it to the remote server's `~/.ssh/authorized_keys` file.\n   \n   or\n  \n   - Use an SSH client that allows you to copy the public key directly from your local machine to the remote server. For example, using PuTTYgen on Windows.\n\n5. Test your connection again:\n   After making sure the correct public key is present on the remote server, try connecting once more:\n\n   ```bash\n   ssh -i \"~/UserKey.pem\" -C -L 25900:localhost:5900 ec2-34-221-131-108.us-west-2.compute.amazonaws.com\n   ```\n\nIf you continue to face issues after following these steps, it might be worth checking if there are any additional security policies or firewalls in place that could be blocking the connection.", "role": "assistant"}}], "created": 1728689835, "model": "openchat-3.6-8b-20240522", "object": "chat.completion", "system_fingerprint": "openchat-3.6-8b-20240522", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 483, "prompt_tokens": 82, "total_tokens": 565}, "time": "26.09"}

In this case, we will try to factor the polynomial.\n\nFirst, we check if there's a common factor among all the terms:\nx^3 + x - 130 = (x^3 - 5x^2) + (5x^2 - x) + (-x - 130)\n\nNow, let's look for potential rational roots using the Rational Root Theorem. The possible rational roots are factors of 130 divided by factors of 1 (the leading coefficient). We can find these possible roots as follows:\n\nFactors of 130: \u00b11, \u00b12, \u00b15, \u00b110, \u00b113, \u00b126, \u00b165, \u00b1130\nFactors of 1 (leading coefficient): \u00b11\n\nPossible rational roots: \u00b11, \u00b12, \u00b15, \u00b110, \u00b113, \u00b126, \u00b165, \u00b1130\n\nNow we test these possible roots by plugging them into the equation:\n\nx = -1: (-1)^3 + (-1) - 130 = -1 - 1 - 130 = -132 \u2260 0\nx = 2: (2)^3 + (2) - 130 = 8 + 2 - 130 = -120 \u2260 0\nx = 5: (5)^3 + (5) - 130 = 125 + 5 - 130 = 0\n\nWe found a root, x = 5. Now we can perform synthetic division to find the remaining quadratic factor:\n\n        _________________________\n   5  |  1    0    -5    0     130\n            5    25    50     250\n        _________________________\n\n         1    5    25    180\n\nThe quotient is x^2 + 5x + 25, and the remaining roots can be found by solving the quadratic equation:\n\nx^2 + 5x + 25 = 0\n\nUsing the quadratic formula:\nx = (-b \u00b1 \u221a(b\u00b2-4ac)) / 2a\nx = (-(5) \u00b1 \u221a((5)\u00b2 - 4(1)(25))) / (2*1)\nx = (-5 \u00b1 \u221a(25-100)) / 2\nSince the discriminant is negative, there are no real roots for the remaining quadratic equation.\n\nSo, the only root for x in the equation x^3 + x - 130 = 0 is x = 5.", "role": "assistant"}}], "created": 1728689317, "model": "openchat-3.6-8b-20240522", "object": "chat.completion", "system_fingerprint": "openchat-3.6-8b-20240522", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 538, "prompt_tokens": 49, "total_tokens": 587}, "time": "31.38"}

We can do this by performing substitution, u = x - p/3.\n\nThe given equation is:\n\nx\u00b3 + x - 130 = 0\n\nLet's set p = 1, q = 0, and r\u00b2 = 130 (since we don't have a single value for r).\n\nSo the depressed cubic equation becomes:\n\n(x - 1)\u00b3 + 1 - 130 = 0\n\nSimplifying:\n\nx\u00b3 - 3x\u00b2 + 3x - 1 = 0 \n\nNow, let's apply Cardano's Formula. We first need to find the discriminant D:\n\nD = 18pq - 4r\u00b3\n\nSince p = 1 and q = 0, we have:\n\nD = 18 * 1 * 0 - 4 * 130 = -520\n\nThe roots of the equation are complex since D < 0. We can find them using Cardano's Formula for complex roots:\n\nx = (p \u00b1 sqrt(D)) / 3 + r\n\nx = (1 \u00b1 sqrt(-520)) / 3 + sqrt(130)\n\nLet \u03c9 be one of the cube roots of unity, i.e., \u03c9\u00b3 = 1. Then, we can rewrite the square root term as follows:\n\nsqrt(-520) = sqrt(4 * 130) * sqrt(-1) = 2i * sqrt(130)\n\nNow, let's substitute this back into our equation:\n\nx = (1 \u00b1 2i * sqrt(130)) / 3 + sqrt(130)\n\nThis gives us two solutions for x. To find the third solution, we can use De Moivre's Theorem:\n\nx = cos(\u03c0/3) + i * sin(\u03c0/3) = (1/2 + \u221a3/2i)\n\nNow we have all three solutions for x:\n\nx1 = 1/2 + (\u221a3/2)i\nx2 = 1/2 - (\u221a3/2)i\nx3 = (-\u221a3/2) + i\n\nThese are the complex roots of the cubic equation.", "role": "assistant"}}], "created": 1728689290, "model": "openchat-3.6-8b-20240522", "object": "chat.completion", "system_fingerprint": "openchat-3.6-8b-20240522", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 488, "prompt_tokens": 55, "total_tokens": 543}, "time": "26.39"}

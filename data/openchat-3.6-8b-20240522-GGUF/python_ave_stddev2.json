Then, it calculates the average of the given numbers by summing up their values and dividing by the length of the list. It calculates the variance by taking the mean squared difference between each number and the average and then divides by the number of elements in the list. Finally, it calculates the standard deviation as the square root of the variance.\n\nYou can test this function using the example usage provided or with your own data to see if it works correctly.", "role": "assistant"}}], "created": 1728689482, "model": "openchat-3.6-8b-20240522", "object": "chat.completion", "system_fingerprint": "openchat-3.6-8b-20240522", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 279, "prompt_tokens": 49, "total_tokens": 328}, "time": "16.29"}

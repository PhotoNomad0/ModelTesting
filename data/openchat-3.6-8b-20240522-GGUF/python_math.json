Here's how you can do it:\n\n```python\nfrom sympy import symbols, Eq, solve\n\ndef solve_cubic(a, b, c, d):\n    x = symbols('x')\n    equation = Eq(a*x**3 + b*x**2 + c*x + d, 0)\n    solutions = solve(equation, x)\n    return solutions\n\n# Example usage:\na, b, c, d = 1, -6, 11, -6  # coefficients of the cubic equation\nsolutions = solve_cubic(a, b, c, d)\nprint(solutions)\n```\n\nMake sure to install sympy if you haven't already:\n\n```bash\npip install sympy\n```\n\nThis program defines a function `solve_cubic` that takes the coefficients a, b, c, and d of the cubic equation as inputs. It then uses sympy's `symbols`, `Eq`, and `solve` functions to find and return all possible values of x that satisfy the given equation.\n\nThe example usage demonstrates how to call the function with specific coefficients for the cubic equation 3x^3 - 6x^2 + 11x - 6 = 0. The program will output all solutions for x in this case.", "role": "assistant"}}], "created": 1728689348, "model": "openchat-3.6-8b-20240522", "object": "chat.completion", "system_fingerprint": "openchat-3.6-8b-20240522", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 303, "prompt_tokens": 59, "total_tokens": 362}, "time": "17.40"}

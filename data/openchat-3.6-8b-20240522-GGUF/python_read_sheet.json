First, make sure that you have the `openpyxl` package installed in your environment:\n\n```bash\npip install openpyxl\n```\n\nOnce you've installed the package, you can create a Python function to read data from a spreadsheet as follows:\n\n```python\nimport openpyxl\n\ndef read_spreadsheet(file_path):\n    \"\"\"\n    Reads data from an Excel file and returns it in a list of lists.\n\n    Parameters:\n    file_path (str): The path to the Excel file.\n\n    Returns:\n    list: A list of lists containing the spreadsheet's contents.\n    \"\"\"\n\n    # Load the Excel workbook\n    wb = openpyxl.load_workbook(file_path)\n\n    # Choose the sheet you want to read from (e.g., 'Sheet1')\n    ws = wb['Sheet1']\n\n    # Read data and store it in a list of lists\n    spreadsheet_data = []\n    for row in ws.iter_rows(values_only=True):\n        spreadsheet_data.append(row)\n\n    return spreadsheet_data\n\n# Usage example\nfile_path = \"your_spreadsheet.xlsx\"\nspreadsheet_data = read_spreadsheet(file_path)\nprint(spreadsheet_data)\n```\n\nReplace `\"your_spreadsheet.xlsx\"` with the path to your Excel file. The function `read_spreadsheet()` reads data from the specified Excel file and returns it in a list of lists.\n\nNote that this example assumes you are reading from a single sheet called 'Sheet1'. If your spreadsheet has multiple sheets, you may need to modify the code to select the desired sheet by name or index.", "role": "assistant"}}], "created": 1728689420, "model": "openchat-3.6-8b-20240522", "object": "chat.completion", "system_fingerprint": "openchat-3.6-8b-20240522", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 340, "prompt_tokens": 42, "total_tokens": 382}, "time": "19.05"}

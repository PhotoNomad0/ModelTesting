After that, you can execute a query to select all records where the \"age\" field is greater than 32.\n\nHere's an example of how you could do this:\n\n```python\nimport sqlite3\n\n# Connect to SQLite database (it will be created if it doesn't exist)\nconnection = sqlite3.connect('example.db')\n\n# Create a cursor object using the cursor() method\ncursor = connection.cursor()\n\n# SQL query to select all records where age is greater than 32\nquery = \"SELECT * FROM your_table_name WHERE age > 32\"\n\n# Execute the SQL command using execute() method\ncursor.execute(query)\n\n# Fetch all rows from the executed SQL command using fetchall() method\nrecords = cursor.fetchall()\n\nfor record in records:\n    print(record)\n\n# Close the connection to the database after completing the task\nconnection.close()\n```\n\nReplace `your_table_name` with the actual name of your table. This script will print out all the records where the age field is greater than 32. Make sure you have a table and data in your SQLite database that matches this example for it to work properly.", "role": "assistant"}}], "created": 1728689884, "model": "openchat-3.6-8b-20240522", "object": "chat.completion", "system_fingerprint": "openchat-3.6-8b-20240522", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 260, "prompt_tokens": 50, "total_tokens": 310}, "time": "13.87"}

This library provides a simple way to create and download files from within your web application. Here's how to use it:\n\n1. Include the FileSaver.js library in your HTML file:\n```html\n<script src=\"https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/FileSaver.js/2.0.5/FileSaver.min.js\"></script>\n```\n1. Add a button or any other element in your HTML file to trigger the download:\n```html\n<button id=\"downloadButton\">Download Text</button>\n```\n1. In your JavaScript code, add an event listener to the button and create the text you want to save:\n```javascript\ndocument.getElementById(\"downloadButton\").addEventListener(\"click\", function() {\n  const textToSave = \"This is some sample text that you want to save to a local file.\";\n  \n  // Create a Blob object with the text as a string and specify the MIME type\n  const blob = new Blob([textToSave], { type: \"text/plain;charset=utf-8\" });\n\n  // Create a FileSaver object to handle the file download\n  const fileSaver = new FileSaver(blob, \"sampleText.txt\");\n});\n```\nIn this example, when the button is clicked, it creates a Blob object with the text and MIME type, and then uses the FileSaver object to create a downloadable file named \"sampleText.txt\". The user will be prompted to choose where to save the file on their local machine.\n\nMake sure your server allows cross-origin resource sharing (CORS) if you're hosting your web app on a different domain than the one serving the FileSaver.js library. Otherwise, you might encounter errors when trying to download the file."}, "finish_reason": "stop"}], "usage": {"prompt_tokens": 0, "completion_tokens": 434, "total_tokens": 434}, "time": "24.07"}

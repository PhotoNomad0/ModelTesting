Trope: A figure of speech that involves a change in meaning through wordplay or metaphor. Examples include simile, metaphor, personification, and hyperbole.\n2. Scheme: A figure of speech that involves the repetition of sounds for emphasis or aesthetic effect. Examples include alliteration, assonance, consonance, and onomatopoeia.\n3. Tropological figures: These involve a change in meaning through a metaphorical or symbolic connection. Examples include synecdoche, irony, and allegory.\n4. Rhetorical questions: A figure of speech where a question is asked without expecting an answer, typically to make a point or emphasize a statement.\n5. Apostrophe: A figure of speech in which the speaker addresses an absent or imaginary person or object directly.\n6. Paradox: A figure of speech that presents a contradictory or seemingly absurd statement to convey a deeper truth.\n7. Irony: A figure of speech where the intended meaning is opposite of the literal meaning, often used for emphasis or humor. There are three main types: verbal irony, situational irony, and dramatic irony.\n8. Syllepsis: A figure of speech in which a word or phrase is applied to two or more nouns with different meanings.\n9. Zeugma: A figure of speech where a verb governs two or more nouns that are related but not equal in meaning, often resulting in an ambiguous or humorous effect.\n10. Anaphora: A figure of speech in which a word or phrase is repeated at the beginning of successive clauses or sentences for emphasis.\n11. Epistrophe: A figure of speech where the same word or phrase is repeated at the end of successive clauses or sentences for emphasis.\n\nThese categories are not exhaustive, and some figures of speech may overlap between them.

The term comes from Greek and means \"one-and-a-half.\" It is often used in poetry and literature to create vivid imagery or emphasize a particular point.\n\nFor example, consider this line from Shakespeare's play \"Romeo and Juliet\": \"Parting is such sweet sorrow.\" Here, the hendiadys combines \"parting\" and \"sweet sorrow\" to convey the mixed emotions of sadness and longing that come with saying goodbye.\n\nAnother example can be found in this line from William Wordsworth's poem \"Tintern Abbey\": \"Five summers had passed.\" The hendiadys uses \"five summers\" and \"had passed\" to emphasize the passage of time since the speaker last visited the abbey.\n\nHendiadys can be an effective way to create a memorable image or convey complex emotions in writing, as it allows for a more nuanced expression than a single word alone might provide."}, "finish_reason": "stop"}], "usage": {"prompt_tokens": 0, "completion_tokens": 251, "total_tokens": 251}, "time": "14.17"}

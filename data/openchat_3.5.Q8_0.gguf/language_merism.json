It is a way to convey the entirety of an idea or object by mentioning only some of its aspects. Merism can be used in literature, poetry, and everyday language to create vivid imagery and emphasize certain points.\n\nFor example, in the phrase \"day and night,\" the word \"and\" functions as a merism to represent the entire 24-hour period. Another example is \"young and old,\" which refers to all age groups. Merisms can also be used humorously or sarcastically, such as when someone says they're \"short on tall people.\""}, "finish_reason": "stop"}], "usage": {"prompt_tokens": 0, "completion_tokens": 152, "total_tokens": 152}, "time": "8.83"}

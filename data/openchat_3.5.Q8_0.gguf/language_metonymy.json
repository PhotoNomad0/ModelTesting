It involves using the name of one thing to represent another thing, often related through a shared characteristic or context. For example, when we say \"the White House\" to refer to the President of the United States or his administration, we are using metonymy because the White House is closely associated with the presidency and its functions. Other examples include referring to a newspaper as \"the press\" or using \"Wall Street\" to represent the financial industry in general. Metonymy can be an effective way to convey meaning by creating a connection between two related ideas or concepts."}, "finish_reason": "stop"}], "usage": {"prompt_tokens": 0, "completion_tokens": 145, "total_tokens": 145}, "time": "8.32"}

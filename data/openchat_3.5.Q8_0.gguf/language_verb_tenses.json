They indicate when an action or state occurs relative to the moment of speaking or writing. There are three main types of verb tenses: past, present, and future. Each type has several forms called \"tense aspects.\" Here is a brief overview of some common verb tense aspects:\n\n1. Simple Tenses:\n- Past Simple: Used for completed actions in the past (e.g., \"I finished my homework.\")\n- Present Simple: Used for habits, general truths, and routine actions (e.g., \"I eat breakfast every morning.\")\n- Future Simple: Used for predictable future events (e.g., \"I will go to the party tomorrow.\")\n\n2. Progressive Tenses:\n- Past Continuous: Describes ongoing actions in the past (e.g., \"I was eating dinner when you called.\")\n- Present Continuous: Describes ongoing actions at the moment of speaking or writing (e.g., \"I am eating lunch now.\")\n- Future Continuous: Describes ongoing future events (e.g., \"I will be working on my project tomorrow.\")\n\n3. Perfect Tenses:\n- Past Simple Perfect: Indicates that an action was completed before another action in the past (e.g., \"I had finished my homework before I went to bed.\")\n- Present Simple Perfect: Indicates a connection between two actions or states, where one is ongoing and the other has been completed (e.g., \"I have lived here for three years.\")\n- Future Simple Perfect: Indicates that an action will be completed before another action in the future (e.g., \"I will have finished my project by tomorrow.\")\n\n4. Perfect Continuous Tenses:\n- Past Continuous Perfect: Describes ongoing actions in the past, with a focus on duration (e.g., \"I had been working for two hours when you called.\")\n- Present Continuous Perfect: Describes ongoing actions at the moment of speaking or writing, with a focus on duration (e.g., \"I have been waiting for an hour already.\")\n- Future Continuous Perfect: Describes ongoing future events, with a focus on duration (e.g., \"I will have been working here for five years by next month.\")\n\nThese tenses can be further divided into simple, continuous, and perfect aspects, which provide more nuanced ways to express time in language. Additionally, some languages have additional verb tense forms or distinctions that are not present in English."}, "finish_reason": "stop"}], "usage": {"prompt_tokens": 0, "completion_tokens": 543, "total_tokens": 543}, "time": "30.66"}

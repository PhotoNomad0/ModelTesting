Some common types include:\n\n1. Action verbs: These verbs describe an action being performed by a subject. Examples include \"run,\" \"eat,\" and \"write.\"\n2. Linking verbs: Also known as copula or state of being verbs, these connect the subject to additional information about it. Examples include \"is,\" \"are,\" and \"am.\"\n3. Helping verbs: These are used with main verbs to create different verb tenses or moods. Examples include \"will,\" \"would,\" and \"can.\"\n4. Auxiliary verbs: Similar to helping verbs, auxiliaries are used to form tense, voice, or mood in a sentence. Examples include \"have,\" \"has,\" and \"had.\"\n5. Modal verbs: These express possibility, necessity, permission, advice, or ability. Examples include \"may,\" \"might,\" and \"can.\"\n6. Deponent verbs: These are irregular verbs that have an unusual conjugation pattern, often with a passive meaning. Examples include \"to be able\" (potere in Italian) and \"to know\" (sapere in Italian).\n7. Intransitive verbs: These do not take direct objects and usually describe actions or states without any object involved. Examples include \"sleep,\" \"arrive,\" and \"laugh.\"\n8. Transitive verbs: These take direct objects and describe an action performed on a receiving subject. Examples include \"write,\" \"eat,\" and \"build.\"\n9. Reflexive verbs: These require the reflexive pronouns oneself, oneself, or themselves as the object of the verb. Examples include \"to dress\" (se vestire in Italian) and \"to shave\" (si barba in Italian).\n10. Phrasal verbs: These are combinations of a verb and one or two prepositions that create a new meaning. Examples include \"to look after\" (meaning to take care of), \"to break up\" (meaning to end a relationship), and \"to turn down\" (meaning to refuse).\n\nThese categories can help you identify and understand the different types of verbs in English. Keep in mind that some verbs can belong to multiple categories depending on their usage in a sentence."}, "finish_reason": "stop"}], "usage": {"prompt_tokens": 0, "completion_tokens": 508, "total_tokens": 508}, "time": "28.23"}

Here are a few steps to troubleshoot and resolve this issue:\n\n1. Check the file permissions of your private key. The file should be readable only by its owner, and you should be the owner of the file. You can use the `ls` command with the `-l` flag to check the permissions:\n```bash\nls -l ~/UserKey.pem\n```\nIf the permissions are not correct (e.g., the file is not readable by the user), you can change them using the `chmod` command:\n```bash\nchmod 600 ~/UserKey.pem\n```\n2. Ensure that the private key file is located in your local home directory and is spelled correctly in the `ssh` command. The path you provided (`~/UserKey.pem`) should be correct if the file is in your home directory.\n3. Double-check the remote host's IP address or DNS name, as well as the port number and local destination address you're trying to connect to. In your command, you are connecting to `ec2-34-221-131-108.us-west-2.compute.amazonaws.com` on port 25900, with a local destination of `localhost:5900`. Make sure these values are correct for your use case.\n4. If you're still experiencing issues, you can try using the full path to the `ssh` command, like this:\n```bash\n/usr/bin/ssh -i \"~/UserKey.pem\" -C -L 25900:localhost:5900 ec2-34-221-131-108.us-west-2.compute.amazonaws.com\n```\nReplace `/usr/bin/ssh` with the actual path to the `ssh` command on your system if it's different.\n\nIf none of these steps resolve the issue, you may need to double-check your SSH configuration files or consult the documentation for the AWS instance you are trying to connect to. Make sure that the instance is properly configured to allow connections from your IP address and is using the correct key pair for authentication."}, "finish_reason": "stop"}], "usage": {"prompt_tokens": 0, "completion_tokens": 545, "total_tokens": 545}, "time": "31.62"}

So, we can rewrite the equation as:\n\n(2^3)^x + 2^x = 130\n\nNow, using the power of a power rule (a^(mn) = a^(m*n)), we get:\n\n2^(3x) + 2^x = 130\n\nNow, let's subtract 2^x from both sides of the equation to isolate the term with the exponent:\n\n2^(3x) = 130 - 2^x\n\nWe can rewrite 130 as a power of 2:\n\n130 = 2^(3 * 4 + 1) = 2^13\n\nSo, our equation becomes:\n\n2^(3x) = 2^13 - 2^x\n\nNow we can set the exponents equal to each other since the bases are the same:\n\n3x = 13 - x\n\nNow, solve for x:\n\n4x = 13\nx = 13/4\n\nHowever, this solution is not valid because x must be a positive integer. So, let's try another approach by testing some values of x to see if they satisfy the original equation.\n\nLet's start with x = 5:\n\n8^5 + 2^5 = 32768 + 32 = 32799\n\nThis is not equal to 130, so x = 5 does not work. Let's try x = 4:\n\n8^4 + 2^4 = 4096 + 16 = 4112\n\nThis is also not equal to 130, so x = 4 does not work either. We can continue testing different values of x until we find one that satisfies the equation or determine that there is no solution. In this case, it turns out that there is no integer value of x that satisfies the equation 8^x + 2^x = 130."}, "finish_reason": "stop"}], "usage": {"prompt_tokens": 0, "completion_tokens": 492, "total_tokens": 492}, "time": "26.76"}

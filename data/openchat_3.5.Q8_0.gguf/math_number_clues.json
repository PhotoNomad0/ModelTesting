You are not a prime number.\n2. You are between 20 and 40.\n3. You are one more than a square number.\n\nSince you are not a prime number, we can eliminate all prime numbers between 20 and 40 (which are 23 and 29). Now, let's consider the square numbers in this range: 16 (4^2), 25 (5^2), and 36 (6^2).\n\nYou mentioned that you are one more than a square number. Based on this clue, we can conclude that you are either 17 (one more than 16) or 27 (one more than 25). However, since you are not a prime number and both 17 and 27 have factors other than 1 and themselves, neither of them fit the criteria.\n\nLet's consider the square numbers one level up: 49 (7^2) and 64 (8^2). You could be either 50 (one more than 49) or 65 (one more than 64). However, since you are not a prime number, we can eliminate 65.\n\nTherefore, the number you are is 50. It is between 20 and 40, one more than a square number (49), and not a prime number. So, I am 50."}, "finish_reason": "stop"}], "usage": {"prompt_tokens": 0, "completion_tokens": 327, "total_tokens": 327}, "time": "18.20"}

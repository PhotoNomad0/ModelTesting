In this case, A = 1, B = 0, and D = -130, so p = 0 and q = -130.\n\nNow we need to find the roots of the auxiliary equation:\n\nt^3 + pt + q = 0\n\nSince p = 0, the auxiliary equation becomes:\n\nt^3 - q = 0\nt^3 = -q\n\nIn our case, q = -130, so:\n\nt^3 = -130\n\nNow we need to find the cube roots of -130. Let t1, t2, and t3 be the three cube roots of -130. Since -130 is negative, we know that one of the cube roots will be negative, and the other two will be complex conjugates.\n\nNow we can use Cardano's formula to find the solutions for x:\n\nx = t1 - (q/t1)\nx = t2 - (q/t2)\nx = t3 - (q/t3)\n\nSince t1, t2, and t3 are the cube roots of -130, we can plug in their values to find the solutions for x. Note that one of the solutions will be real, and the other two will be complex conjugates.\n\nx = t1 - (-130/t1)\nx = t2 - (-130/t2)\nx = t3 - (-130/t3)"}, "finish_reason": "stop"}], "usage": {"prompt_tokens": 0, "completion_tokens": 414, "total_tokens": 414}, "time": "24.50"}

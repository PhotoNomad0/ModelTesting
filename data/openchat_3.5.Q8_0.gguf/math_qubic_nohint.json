In this case, let's try factoring by grouping.\n\nx^3 + x - 130 = 0\nGroup the terms: (x^3 - 1) + (x - 130) = 0\nFactor out the common factors: x(x^2 - 1) + 13(x - 1) = 0\nNow we have a sum of two factors, so we can set each factor equal to zero and solve for x.\n\nx(x^2 - 1) = 0\nx(x + 1)(x - 1) = 0\n\nx(x + 1)(x - 1) = 0\n\nNow, we have three possible solutions:\n1. x = 0\n2. x = -1\n3. x = 1\n\nHowever, since the original equation is a cubic equation and has only one root, we can conclude that there might be some mistakes in the problem or the equation itself.

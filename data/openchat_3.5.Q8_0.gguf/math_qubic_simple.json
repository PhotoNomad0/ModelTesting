However, in this case, our equation is a bit more complicated and cannot be directly solved using Cardano's formula. We need to first make it into a cubic form by completing the cube.\n\nLet's rewrite the given equation as:\nx^3 - x + 129 = 0\n\nNow, we can use Cardano's formula to solve for x. The formula is:\n\nx = (\u221a(u^3 + v^3) - u) / 3\n\nwhere u and v are the roots of the quadratic equation:\n\np^2 - tr + r = 0\n\nIn our case, t = 1 and r = -129. We need to find the values of p and q that satisfy this quadratic equation.\n\n(p - 1/2)^2 - (1)(-129) = 0\n\nSolving for p, we get:\n\np = \u00b1\u221a(1 + 4q)\n\nNow, we need to find the values of q that satisfy this equation. We can do this by trying different values of q and solving for p. After some trial and error, we find that q = -27/4 works.\n\np = \u00b1\u221a(1 + 4(-27/4)) = \u00b1\u221a(-39)\n\nNow, we have the values of u and v:\n\nu = \u221a(-39)\nv = -\u221a(-39)\n\nFinally, we can use Cardano's formula to find the value of x:\n\nx = (\u221a((\u221a(-39))^3 + (-\u221a(-39))^3) - \u221a(-39)) / 3\n\nx = (\u221a(39\u221a39) - \u221a(-39)) / 3\n\nSince we have a complex value for x, there are three solutions in total: one real and two complex conjugates. The real solution is approximately x \u2248 1.246. The two complex conjugate solutions are approximately x \u2248 \u00b10.758 + \u221a(-39)i."}, "finish_reason": "stop"}], "usage": {"prompt_tokens": 0, "completion_tokens": 501, "total_tokens": 501}, "time": "29.61"}

The `find_roots` function will return a list of all possible real or complex solutions for the given cubic equation. Note that this code assumes that the equation has at least one real root, which is true for most cases. If you need to handle equations without real roots, additional modifications may be required."}, "finish_reason": "stop"}], "usage": {"prompt_tokens": 0, "completion_tokens": 553, "total_tokens": 553}, "time": "30.89"}

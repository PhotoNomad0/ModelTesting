Then, it iterates through the numbers between 20 and 40, calculates their square roots, and checks if they are one more than a perfect square. If the condition is met and the number is not prime, the program prints the answer. In this case, the output will be:\n\n```\nThe number you are looking for is 36.\n```\nThis is because 36 is between 20 and 40, one more than a square (9^2), and not a prime number."}, "finish_reason": "stop"}], "usage": {"prompt_tokens": 0, "completion_tokens": 275, "total_tokens": 275}, "time": "16.62"}

It takes two parameters: `file_path` (the path to the Excel file) and `sheet_name` (the name of the sheet you want to read). The function returns a list of lists containing the data from the specified sheet. If the file is not found or an error occurs, the function will return None. Make sure to install openpyxl using `pip install openpyxl` before running this code.\n\nTo use this function, simply call it with the appropriate arguments:\n```python\nfile_path = 'path/to/your/excel_file.xlsx'\nsheet_name = 'Sheet1'\ndata = read_excel(file_path, sheet_name)\nprint(data)\n```\nReplace `'path/to/your/excel_file.xlsx'` with the actual path to your Excel file and `'Sheet1'` with the name of the sheet you want to read. If the function returns None, it means there was an error or the file was not found. Otherwise, the variable `data` will contain the data from the specified sheet as a list of lists."}, "finish_reason": "stop"}], "usage": {"prompt_tokens": 0, "completion_tokens": 418, "total_tokens": 418}, "time": "24.84"}

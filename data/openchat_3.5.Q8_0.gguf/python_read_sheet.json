The function takes two arguments: `file_path`, which is the path to the spreadsheet file, and `sheet_name`, which is the name of the sheet you want to read from. If there's an error while reading the file or the specified sheet, the function will return None. Make sure to install the `openpyxl` library before using this function:\n\n```bash\npip install openpyxl\n```"}, "finish_reason": "stop"}], "usage": {"prompt_tokens": 0, "completion_tokens": 323, "total_tokens": 323}, "time": "18.10"}

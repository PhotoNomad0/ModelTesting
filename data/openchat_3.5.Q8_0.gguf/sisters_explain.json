We can represent this information as follows:\n\nSally's brothers: B1, B2, B3\nSally's sisters: S1, S2\n\nWe know that Sally has 3 brothers, so:\nB1 = B2 = B3 = 1\n\nWe also know that her brothers have 2 sisters, so:\nS1 + S2 = 2\n\nNow we can solve for the number of sisters Sally has. Since each brother is equal to 1, and there are 3 brothers, we can multiply the number of sisters by 3 to find the total number of sisters:\n\n(S1 + S2) * 3 = 2\n\nSince B1, B2, and B3 are all equal to 1, we can also represent this as:\n\n(S1 + S2) * (B1 + B2 + B3) = 2\n\nNow we can plug in the values for the brothers and sisters:\n\n(S1 + S2) * 3 = 2\n\nSince Sally has 3 brothers, she must also have 3 sisters. So, S1 = S2 = 1. Now we can plug these values back into our equation:\n\n(1 + 1) * 3 = 2\n\nThis equation is not true, which means there's an error in the initial information provided. It's not possible for Sally to have 3 brothers and her brothers to have 2 sisters at the same time. Please check the information given and try again."}, "finish_reason": "stop"}], "usage": {"prompt_tokens": 0, "completion_tokens": 350, "total_tokens": 350}, "time": "21.11"}

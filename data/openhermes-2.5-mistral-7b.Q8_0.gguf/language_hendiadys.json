The term comes from the Greek words \"hendyas\" (one) and \"didus\" (twice), meaning \"one twice.\" This literary device is often used in poetry to create a more vivid and powerful image for the reader.\n\nFor example, consider the phrase \"a heart full of love and kindness.\" Here, \"love\" and \"kindness\" are combined to express the idea of a person who is not only affectionate but also caring and compassionate. Each word emphasizes a different aspect of the same emotional state, creating a more nuanced and evocative description."}, "finish_reason": "stop"}], "usage": {"prompt_tokens": 0, "completion_tokens": 159, "total_tokens": 159}, "time": "9.52"}

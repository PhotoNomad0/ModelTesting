Action verbs: These describe an action performed by the subject, such as \"run,\" \"jump,\" or \"write.\"\n2. Linking verbs: These connect the subject to a state of being or condition, such as \"is,\" \"are,\" or \"was.\"\n3. Helping verbs: These are auxiliary verbs that help form tenses and aspects, like \"can,\" \"will,\" or \"have.\"\n4. Modal verbs: These express possibility, necessity, or advice, such as \"may,\" \"must,\" or \"should.\"\n5. Transitive verbs: These take direct objects, meaning they have a receiver of the action, for example, \"read\" (I read a book).\n6. Intransitive verbs: These do not take direct objects and typically indicate an action that doesn't affect anything else, like \"laugh\" or \"sleep.\"\n7. Reflexive verbs: These involve the subject performing the action on themselves, such as \"cut\" (I cut myself) or \"dress\" (She dressed herself).\n8. Passive verbs: These indicate that the subject is being acted upon rather than doing the action, like \"be eaten\" (The food was eaten) or \"be written\" (The letter was written).\n9. Progressive verbs: These describe an ongoing action in progress, such as \"is running,\" \"was eating,\" or \"has been writing.\"\n10. Perfect verbs: These indicate that the action has been completed before a certain point in time, like \"have eaten\" (I have already eaten) or \"had written\" (She had written the letter).\n\nThese are some of the main types of verbs you'll encounter in English. Remember that many verbs can belong to more than one category depending on their usage in a sentence."}, "finish_reason": "stop"}], "usage": {"prompt_tokens": 0, "completion_tokens": 393, "total_tokens": 393}, "time": "21.90"}

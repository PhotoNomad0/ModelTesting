Here's a breakdown of the command:\n\n1. `ssh` - This is the command for establishing an SSH connection.\n2. `-i \"~/UserKey.pem\"` - This specifies the private key file to use for authentication. The tilde (~) represents the home directory, so this will look for a file named UserKey.pem in the user's home directory.\n3. `-C` - This enables compression of the data being transferred over the SSH connection, which can help improve performance and reduce bandwidth usage.\n4. `-L 25900:localhost:5900` - This sets up a local port forwarding. It forwards incoming connections on port 25900 of the local machine to port 5900 on the remote machine (the EC2 instance). This allows you to access the remote machine's display server (usually running on port 5900) through your local machine by connecting to localhost:25900.\n5. `user@ec2-34-221-131-108.us-west-2.compute.amazonaws.com` - This specifies the username and hostname of the remote EC2 instance. The IP address and region may vary depending on your specific setup.\n\nTo use this command, you would need to replace \"user\" with your actual AWS username and provide the correct path to your UserKey.pem file if it's located elsewhere. Once executed, this command will establish an SSH connection to the specified EC2 instance and allow you to interact with it as if you were logged in locally."}, "finish_reason": "stop"}], "usage": {"prompt_tokens": 0, "completion_tokens": 384, "total_tokens": 384}, "time": "23.46"}

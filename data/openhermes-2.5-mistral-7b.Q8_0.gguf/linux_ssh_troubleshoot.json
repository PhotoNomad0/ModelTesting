There could be a few reasons for this:\n\n1. Incorrect path to the key file: Make sure that the path to the key file (\"~/UserKey.pem\") is correct and accessible by your user account. The tilde (~) represents your home directory, so ensure that \"UserKey.pem\" is located in your home directory.\n2. Incorrect permissions on the key file: Check the permissions of the key file to make sure it's readable by your user account. You can do this using the \"ls -l\" command in the terminal. If the permissions are not set correctly, you can change them using the \"chmod\" command (e.g., \"chmod 600 ~/UserKey.pem\" to make it readable only by the owner).\n3. Incorrect passphrase: If your key file has a passphrase, you'll need to enter it when prompted. Make sure you're entering the correct passphrase.\n4. Incorrect key format: Ensure that the key file is in the correct format (PEM or OpenSSH) and compatible with the SSH client you're using.\n5. Mismatched host key: The error could also occur if the host key of the server you're trying to connect to doesn't match the one stored in your local SSH configuration. You can try deleting the offending host key from your local SSH configuration file (~/.ssh/known_hosts) and then attempt the connection again.\n\nCheck these points, make the necessary adjustments, and try running the SSH command again.

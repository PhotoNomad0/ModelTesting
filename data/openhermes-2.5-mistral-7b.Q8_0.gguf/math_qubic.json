In this case, a = 1, b = 0, c = 1, and d = -130, so we have:\n\nx^3 + x - 130 = 0\n\nNow, let's find the values of p and q:\n\np = 0 (since b = 0)\nq = -130 (since d = -130)\n\nCardano's formula for solving a cubic equation is given by:\n\nx = (u + v)^(1/3) + (u - v)^(1/3) + (-u)^(1/3)\n\nwhere u and v are the roots of the quadratic equation:\n\nuv = q\nu^2 + v^2 = p^2 + 4q\n\nSubstituting the values of p and q, we get:\n\nu^2 + v^2 = 0 + 4(-130)\nu^2 + v^2 = -520\n\nSince u and v are roots of a quadratic equation, they must be complex numbers. Let's assume u = r * e^(i\u03b8) and v = s * e^(i\u03c6), where r, s, \u03b8, and \u03c6 are real numbers. Then:\n\nrs = -130\nr^2 + s^2 = 520\n\nNow, we need to find the values of r, \u03b8, s, and \u03c6. To do this, we can use the following trigonometric identities:\n\ncos(\u03b8) = (u/r)\nsin(\u03b8) = (imaginary part of u)/(r)\ncos(\u03c6) = (v/s)\nsin(\u03c6) = (imaginary part of v)/(s)\n\nSince b = 0, the imaginary parts of u and v will be non-zero. Let's assume:\n\nu = r * e^(i\u03b8) = r * (cos(\u03b8) + i * sin(\u03b8))\nv = s * e^(i\u03c6) = s * (cos(\u03c6) + i * sin(\u03c6))\n\nNow, we can find the values of r, \u03b8, s, and \u03c6 using the equations:\n\nrs = -130\nr^2 + s^2 = 520\ncos(\u03b8) = cos(\u03c6) = 0 (since u and v are complex numbers)\nsin(\u03b8) = sin(\u03c6) = \u00b1\u221a3 (since r^2 + s^2 = 520, which is equal to the sum of the squares of two numbers with a product of -130)\n\nFrom the equations above, we can deduce that:\n\nr = s\n\u03b8 = \u03c0/2\n\u03c6 = \u03c0/2\n\nNow, we can substitute these values into Cardano's formula to find the roots of the cubic equation:\n\nx = (u + v)^(1/3) + (u - v)^(1/3) + (-u)^(1/3)\nx = ((r * e^(i\u03c0/4)) + (r * e^(-i\u03c0/4))) + ((r * e^(i\u03c0/4)) - (r * e^(-i\u03c0/4))) + (-r * e^(i\u03c0/4))\nx = 2r * e^(i\u03c0/4)\n\nSince x is a complex number, we can write it in polar form:\n\nx = \u221a(520) * e^(i\u03c0/4)\n\nSo, the roots of the given cubic equation are:\n\nx1 = \u221a(520) * e^(i\u03c0/4)\nx2 = \u221a(520) * e^(-i\u03c0/4)\n\nThese are the complex solutions to the cubic equation x^3 + x - 130 = 0."}, "finish_reason": "stop"}], "usage": {"prompt_tokens": 0, "completion_tokens": 859, "total_tokens": 859}, "time": "53.88"}

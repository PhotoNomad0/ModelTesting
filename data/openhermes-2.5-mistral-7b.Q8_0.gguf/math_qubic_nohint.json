In this case, we will use a trial and error approach to approximate the solution.\n\n1. Start by finding an initial guess for the root. Since the equation is a cubic equation, it has three roots. We can start by trying x = 0, 1, -1, 2, or -2 as our initial guesses.\n\n2. Substitute each guess into the equation and check if it satisfies the equation. If not, adjust the value and continue testing until you find a suitable root.\n\nUsing trial and error, we can find that x = 3 is an approximate solution to the equation:\n\n(3)^3 + 3 - 130 = -126\n\nHowever, this is not a perfect solution since the result is not equal to zero. We can continue refining our guess by trying other values close to 3. After some trial and error, we find that x \u2248 3.058 is a better approximation:\n\n(3.058)^3 + 3.058 - 130 \u2248 -0.002\n\nThis result is closer to zero but still not perfect. We can continue refining our guess, but it's essential to note that the equation x^3 + x - 130 = 0 does not have an exact rational root. Therefore, we will only be able to find an approximate solution using numerical methods.\n\nIn conclusion, there is no exact value for x in the equation x^3 + x - 130 = 0. However, we can find an approximate solution by using trial and error or other numerical methods such as the Newton-Raphson method. In this case, our best approximation is x \u2248 3.058."}, "finish_reason": "stop"}], "usage": {"prompt_tokens": 0, "completion_tokens": 410, "total_tokens": 410}, "time": "23.81"}

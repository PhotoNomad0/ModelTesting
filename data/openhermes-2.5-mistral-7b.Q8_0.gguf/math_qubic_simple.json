In this case, p = 1 and q = -130.\n\nNow, let's find the roots of the cubic equation using Cardano's formula:\n\nx = (r + s)^(1/3) + (r - s)^(1/3)\n\nwhere r = (-p/3) + ((-p^2/3)^0.5)/2 and s = (-p/3) - ((-p^2/3)^0.5)/2\n\nFor our equation, p = 1, so:\n\nr = (-1/3) + ((-1^2/3)^0.5)/2 = (-1/3) + (1/2) = -1/6\ns = (-1/3) - ((-1^2/3)^0.5)/2 = (-1/3) - (1/2) = -2/3\n\nNow, we can plug these values into the Cardano's formula:\n\nx = ((-1/6) + (-2/3))^(1/3) + ((-1/6) - (-2/3))^(1/3)\nx = (-5/6)^(1/3) + (1/6)^(1/3)\n\nUsing a calculator, we get:\n\nx \u2248 -2.0497\n\nSo, one of the roots of the equation x^3 + x - 130 = 0 is approximately x \u2248 -2.0497. Note that Cardano's formula gives two more complex roots in addition to this real root."}, "finish_reason": "stop"}], "usage": {"prompt_tokens": 0, "completion_tokens": 388, "total_tokens": 388}, "time": "22.97"}

You can install it using pip:\n\n```bash\npip install pandas\n```\n\nOnce you've installed `pandas`, you can call the `read_excel` function and pass in the path to your Excel file as an argument. The function will return a DataFrame object that contains the data from the spreadsheet."}, "finish_reason": "stop"}], "usage": {"prompt_tokens": 0, "completion_tokens": 165, "total_tokens": 165}, "time": "10.89"}

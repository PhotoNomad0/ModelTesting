When you were 6 years old, your sister was half your age. So when you were 6, your sister was 6 / 2 = 3 years old.\n2. Now that you are 80 years old, we need to find out how many years have passed since you were 6. The difference is 80 - 6 = 74 years.\n3. To find out your sister's current age, add the 74 years to her age when you were 6: 3 + 74 = 77 years old.\n\nSo, your sister is currently 77 years old."}, "finish_reason": "stop"}], "usage": {"prompt_tokens": 0, "completion_tokens": 141, "total_tokens": 141}, "time": "7.88"}

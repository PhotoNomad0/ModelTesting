Help as much as you can.\n\n### User:\nexplain use of Large Language Models (LLM) in AI research\n\n### Response:\n\n\nLarge Language Models, or LLMs for short, are a crucial part of advancing Artificial Intelligence technology. These models serve as the foundation upon which other AI systems can be built. They provide state-of-the-art natural language processing abilities and learn from user interactions. Researchers in this field use these advanced models to develop smarter computer assisted instruction (CAI) systems, creating a more human-like conversational agent. These LLMs help improve the understanding between man and machine, leading eventually to stronger AI with human-like qualities.\n\nIn conclusion:\nLarge Language Models play an essential role in advancing Artificial Intelligence technology by providing state-of-the-art natural language processing abilities and learning from user interactions. They form the foundation upon which other AI systems can be built, ultimately leading to stronger AI with more human-like qualities. Researchers working on these advanced models contribute significantly to the development of smarter CAI systems."}], "created": 1693330111, "id": "foobarbaz", "model": "ggml-openorca-platypus2-13b.ggmlv3.q4_K_M.bin", "object": "text_completion", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 214, "prompt_tokens": 69, "total_tokens": 283}, "time": "29.79"}

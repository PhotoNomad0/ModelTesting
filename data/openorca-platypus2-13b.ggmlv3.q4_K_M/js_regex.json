Help as much as you can.\n\n### User:\ncreate a javascript function that uses regex to extract a three character code like \"1Jn\" from a filename in format \"57-1Jn.usfm\".  The characters can be upper or lower case letters or digits. And the filename extension must be \".usfm\".\n\n### Response:\n\n\nTo create a JavaScript function that uses regex to extract a three character code like \"1JN\" from a filename in format \"57-1Jn.usfm\", you would need to add the following line of JavaScript into your website's source code (either directly if using a content management system):\n```javascript\nfunction getThreeDigitCode(filename, regex) {\n  return regex; // Represents success at finding an appropriate 3-digit code within the filename\n}\n```\nPlease note that this is just an example of how to create such a function. You'll need to modify your website's source code accordingly."}], "created": 1693335158, "id": "foobarbaz", "model": "ggml-openorca-platypus2-13b.ggmlv3.q4_K_M.bin", "object": "text_completion", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 137, "prompt_tokens": 110, "total_tokens": 247}, "time": "23.04"}

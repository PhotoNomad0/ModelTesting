Help as much as you can.\n\n### User:\nIn the morning, Emily decided to create some designs with her cereal bits. In total, she created 9 designs and used 63 cereal bits. About how many cereal bits were in each design? Do you think she used an equal number of cereal bits in each design?\n\n### Response:\n\n\nEmily did indeed create nine different designs, with sixty-three individual cereal bit contributions in total. It is not explicitly stated that the same number of cereal bits represents a contribution to each design; however, it can be reasonably assumed that she intended for an equal distribution of cereal bits per design."}], "created": 1693330210, "id": "foobarbaz", "model": "ggml-openorca-platypus2-13b.ggmlv3.q4_K_M.bin", "object": "text_completion", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 67, "prompt_tokens": 117, "total_tokens": 184}, "time": "16.50"}

Help as much as you can.\n\n### User:\nHarmony used discarded paper to make notepads for her friends. She would fold five letter size pieces of paper three times then cut along the lines. She would then stack the smaller note papers and staple them together. How long would one notepad last if someone wrote ten notes per day?\n\n### Response:\n\n\nIf you write 10 notes a day, it is estimated that each person writes about 532 words per month. If written material lasts for approximately four years, then the notepad should also last for approximately four years.*\u2063* Paper note pads typically have an expected lifespan of around four years when consistently updated with new information daily."}], "created": 1693330177, "id": "foobarbaz", "model": "ggml-openorca-platypus2-13b.ggmlv3.q4_K_M.bin", "object": "text_completion", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 78, "prompt_tokens": 117, "total_tokens": 195}, "time": "17.31"}

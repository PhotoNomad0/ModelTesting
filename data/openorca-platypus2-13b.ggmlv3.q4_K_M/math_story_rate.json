Help as much as you can.\n\n### User:\nBefore Cam broke his right arm, he was able to type 9 words per minute on his phone.  After he broke his arm, he had to use his left hand for a while, and he could only type 6 words per minute. What is the difference between the number of words he could type in 5 minutes before and after he broke his arm\n\n### Response:\n\n\nTo calculate this, multiply your proficiency rate by 1.0. This means that you are able to write at a pace consistent with your thoughts on the matter.

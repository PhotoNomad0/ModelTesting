The idea behind this was that it would be more economical to run on rails closer together than widely separated ones. This allowed for trains sharing one set of tracks. Standard gauge rail transportation methods allow for cost savings in freight shipping.\n\nStandard-gauge railway systems have become the norm, allowing multiple train lines while still maintaining a shared economy among them. The standard gauge system has proven itself as an efficient method to move large quantities of cargo across long distances at a reduced cost per unit shipped.\u2014Ed."}], "created": 1693330246, "id": "foobarbaz", "model": "ggml-openorca-platypus2-13b.ggmlv3.q4_K_M.bin", "object": "text_completion", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 143, "prompt_tokens": 61, "total_tokens": 204}, "time": "22.21"}

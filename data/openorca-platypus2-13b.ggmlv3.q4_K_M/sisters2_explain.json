Help as much as you can.\n\n### User:\nSally is a girl with 3 brothers. Her brothers have 2 sisters. How many sisters does Sally have? Explain your answer\n\n### Response:\n\n\nTo determine the number of sisters, we need to consider that each brother brings an additional sister for Sally. So if there are three brothers and two sisters per brother, then you can calculate how many sister relationships Sally has by adding one relationship for every addition of a new relationship created by her brothers. In this case, since her brothers have added 2 more sister relationships each creating yet another.\n\nSo the number of sisters Sally has is: Number_of_Sisters = Brothers +1 where \"+\" represents the creation of an additional sister for every brother that is created, plus one more relationship for each new addition. Therefore, the calculated total number of sister relationships involving Sally is 3 x (2+1) which equals 6.\n\nSo, Sally has 6 sisters."}], "created": 1693333457, "id": "foobarbaz", "model": "ggml-openorca-platypus2-13b.ggmlv3.q4_K_M.bin", "object": "text_completion", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 170, "prompt_tokens": 83, "total_tokens": 253}, "time": "25.85"}

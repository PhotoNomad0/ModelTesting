Help as much as you can.\n\n### User:\nwhen I was 6, my sister was half my age. Now I am 80. How old is my sister now? Calculate this step by step.\n\n### Response:\n\n\nFirst, let's calculate your current age. If you're currently 80 years old, that means your sister would be half of your current age.\n\nSo, if your sister is now (your age) / 2, then she must be at least (age_6)/2.\n\nSince your sister is now older than you were at age 6, we can calculate her current age based on information given so far.\n\nIf your sister was half of your age when you were 6 years old, and if it's been more than a decade since then (given as currently 80), we know she must be older than you were at age 19 (currently 39)."}], "created": 1693330135, "id": "foobarbaz", "model": "ggml-openorca-platypus2-13b.ggmlv3.q4_K_M.bin", "object": "text_completion", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 153, "prompt_tokens": 86, "total_tokens": 239}, "time": "23.96"}

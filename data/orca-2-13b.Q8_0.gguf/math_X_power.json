Let's follow these steps:1. Rewrite the equation: 8^x + 2^x = 302^(x/2) = 3 (since a^x and a^x = a^2^x)2 implies a^x * a^2 = a^(2x). Divide both sides by 2^x : (2^(x/2) = 8^(1/2) => 2^(x/2) = 3/(8^1/2) => 4 = 9/82. Simplify: 2^(x/2 - x) = 9/8. Take the logarithm of both sides: ln(2^(x/2) - x) = ln(9/8). Solve for x : x/2 - ln(2 = ln(9). Add ln(2) to both sides: x = ln(9). Therefore, the value of x is ln(9)."}, "finish_reason": "stop"}], "usage": {"prompt_tokens": 0, "completion_tokens": 246, "total_tokens": 246}, "time": "22.84"}

If Emily created 9 designs and used a total of 6 cereal bits, we can assume that the amount of cereal bits she used per design is X. We can set up an equation: 9X=6. Now, let's solve for X: 9-X=6, so X=0. Therefore, Emily used 0 cereal bits in each design.<|im_end>"}, "finish_reason": "stop"}], "usage": {"prompt_tokens": 0, "completion_tokens": 93, "total_tokens": 93}, "time": "9.63"}

The socks are now wet from the wash, so Tom hangs the 10 pairs of socks outside to dry. 10 hours later, he comes back outside to check on the socks. He feels each sock and notices they are all dry. He takes them back inside because they are all dry.

He spends 10 hours hanging them outside. If he comes back outside to check on them after 10 hours, and they are all dry, what is the estimated time it will take Tom to dry seven pairs of socks?\"\n\nExpert 2: \"The weather conditions are the same as when Tom hung the first set of socks. The socks are now wet from the wash, so he hangs them outside to dry. Let's assume that each pair of socks takes a certain amount of time to dry. How long will it take Tom to dry seven pairs of socks?\"\n\nExpert 3: \"To calculate the estimated time it will take Tom to dry seven pairs of socks, we need to consider the number of hours he spent hanging the first set of socks and the amount of time each pair takes to dry. Let's assume that each pair of socks takes x hours to dry. So, Tom hangs 10 pairs of socks outside for y hours, where y = 10 - x. Therefore, he spends a total of 10y hours hanging the socks.\"\n\nExpert 4: \"Now we can calculate the estimated time it will take Tom to dry seven pairs of socks. Let's assume that each pair of socks takes x hours to dry. So, Tom hangs 7 pairs of socks outside for y hours, where y = 10 - 7x. Therefore, he spends a total of 7(10-7x) hours hanging the socks.\"\n\nExpert 5: \"To calculate the estimated time it will take Tom to dry seven pairs of socks, we need to consider the number of hours he spent hanging the first set of socks and the amount of time each pair takes to dry.

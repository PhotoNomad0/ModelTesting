Help as much as you can.\n\n### User:\nTom washed 10 pairs of socks. The socks are now wet from the wash, so Tom hangs the 10 pairs of socks outside to dry. 10 hours later, he comes back outside to check on the socks. He feels each sock and notices they are all dry. He takes them back inside because they are all dry. How long will it take Tom to dry seven pairs of socks presuming the same weather conditions?\n\n### Response:\n\n\nAssuming that the weather conditions remain the same, it would take Tom 10 hours to dry one pair of socks. Therefore, he would need to hang out 7 pairs of wet socks for a total of 9 hours (10 hours x 7 pairs) to ensure that all seven pairs are dry."}], "created": 1692879908, "id": "foobarbaz", "model": "Mini Orca (Large)", "object": "text_completion", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 63, "prompt_tokens": 141, "total_tokens": 204}, "time": "138.17"}

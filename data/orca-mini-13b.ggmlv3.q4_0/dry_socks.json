Help as much as you can.\n\n### User:\nTom washed 10 pairs of socks. The socks are now wet from the wash, so Tom hangs the 10 pairs of socks outside to dry. 10 hours later, he comes back outside to check on the socks. He feels each sock and notices they are all dry. He takes them back inside because they are all dry. How long will it take Tom to dry seven pairs of socks presuming the same weather conditions?\n\n### Response:\n\n\nAssuming that the weather conditions remain the same, Tom can hang the seven pairs of socks outside to dry in the same amount of time as he hung the ten pairs of socks. Therefore, the total time it will take Tom to dry all seven pairs of socks is 10 hours."}], "created": 1690485538, "id": "foobarbaz", "model": "Mini Orca (Large)", "object": "text_completion", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 57, "prompt_tokens": 141, "total_tokens": 198}, "time": "22.39"}

Help as much as you can.\n\n### User:\ncreate a javascript function that uses regex to extract a three character code like \"1Jn\" from a filename in format \"57-1Jn.usfm\".  The characters can be upper or lower case letters or digits. And the filename extension must be \".usfm\".\n\n### Response:\n\n\nSure, here's a JavaScript function that does what you're asking for:\n\n```javascript\nfunction extractCode(filename) {\n var regex = /^[a-zA-Z0-9]*\\.usfm$/;\n var matches = filename.match(regex);\n if (matches) {\n return matches[0];\n } else {\n return null;\n }\n}\n```\n\nHere's how it works:\n\n1. The `regex` variable is a regular expression that matches the pattern you described: \"^[a-zA-Z0-9]*\\.usfm$\". \n2. The `matches` variable is an array of all the matches that the regex finds in the `filename`.\n3. We check if `matches` is not null, which means there are at least three characters in the filename.\n4. If there are at least three characters, we return the first element in the `matches` array (which should be the three-character code). \n5. If there aren't any matches, we return `null`."}], "created": 1693336772, "id": "foobarbaz", "model": "Mini Orca (Large)", "object": "text_completion", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 248, "prompt_tokens": 110, "total_tokens": 358}, "time": "27.75"}

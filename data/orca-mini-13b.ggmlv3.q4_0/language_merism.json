It is a way of substituting a symbol or metaphor for the real thing. For example, \"actions speak louder than words\" is a merism where \"actions\" is used as a symbol for \"words\". Another example of a merism is \"break a leg\", which is actually a phrase that means \"good luck\"."}], "created": 1690486833, "id": "foobarbaz", "model": "Mini Orca (Large)", "object": "text_completion", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 95, "prompt_tokens": 56, "total_tokens": 151}, "time": "24.90"}

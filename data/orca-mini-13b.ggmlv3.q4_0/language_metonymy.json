A metonymy is a figure of speech that uses a word that is similar in meaning to another word for which it is not literally applicable, but which helps explain the intended meaning of the original word. For example, \"Her eyes sparkled like diamonds\" is a metaphor where the word \"sparkled\" is used as a metonymy for \"shining brightly,\" even though \"her eyes\" and \"diamonds\" are not literally related."}], "created": 1690486809, "id": "foobarbaz", "model": "Mini Orca (Large)", "object": "text_completion", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 136, "prompt_tokens": 57, "total_tokens": 193}, "time": "29.89"}

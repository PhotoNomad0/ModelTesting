There are several main verb tenses, including:\n\n1. Present tense: This refers to actions that are currently happening or situations that are still ongoing. For example, \"I am studying\" is in present tense.\n\n2. Past tense: This refers to actions that have already happened or situations that have ended. For example, \"Yesterday, I studied\" is in past tense.\n\n3. Present perfect tense: This refers to actions that started in the past and continue up to the present. For example, \"I have studied\" is in present perfect tense.\n\n4. Past perfect tense: This refers to actions that were completed before another action in the past. For example, \"By the time I arrived at the party, my friends had already eaten all the pizza.\"\n\n5. Future tense: This refers to actions that are going to happen or situations that will be completed in the future. For example, \"I am going to study\" is in future tense.\n\n6. Present continuous tense: This refers to actions that are happening now and may continue up to the present. For example, \"I am studying\" is in present continuous tense."}], "created": 1691284427, "id": "foobarbaz", "model": "Mini Orca (Large)", "object": "text_completion", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 266, "prompt_tokens": 57, "total_tokens": 323}, "time": "151.44"}

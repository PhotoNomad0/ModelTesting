In this case, the port number is 25900.\n\nAfter that, the `-i` option specifies the private key file (in this case, \"~/UserKey.pem\") that the user will use to authenticate themselves.\n\nThe `-C` option tells SSH to prompt the user for a password before connecting.\n\nFinally, the `user@ec2-34-221-131-108.us-west-2.compute.amazonaws.com` is the IP address of the remote server that the user wants to connect to."}], "created": 1690486965, "id": "foobarbaz", "model": "Mini Orca (Large)", "object": "text_completion", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 188, "prompt_tokens": 120, "total_tokens": 308}, "time": "44.93"}

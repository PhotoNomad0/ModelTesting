Help as much as you can.\n\n### User:\nwhy does this command give error Permission denied (publickey):\n\nssh -i \\\u201c~/UserKey.pem\" -C -L 25900:localhost:5900 ec2-34-221-131-108.us-west-2.compute.amazonaws.com\n\n### Response:\n\n\nThe command is trying to connect to a remote server (Amazon Web Services) using SSH, but the public key that is provided does not have permission to access the target server. \n\nTo resolve this error, you can try the following steps:\n\n1. Verify if the public key file (~/UserKey.pem) is located on your local machine and has the correct permissions to access the target server.\n2. Make sure that the IP address of the target server (25900:localhost:5900) matches the actual IP address of the target server.\n3. If the public key file is correct, try re-running the command with the -i flag followed by the path to the public key file. For example: ssh -i ~/UserKey.pem -C -L 25900:localhost:5900 ec2-34-221-131-108.us-west-2.compute.amazonaws.com\n\nIf the above steps do not work, you can contact Amazon Web Services support for further assistance."}], "created": 1690488438, "id": "foobarbaz", "model": "Mini Orca (Large)", "object": "text_completion", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 243, "prompt_tokens": 128, "total_tokens": 371}, "time": "1472.81"}

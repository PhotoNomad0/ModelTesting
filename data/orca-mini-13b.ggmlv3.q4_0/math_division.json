Help as much as you can.\n\n### User:\nIn the morning, Emily decided to create some designs with her cereal bits. In total, she created 9 designs and used 63 cereal bits. About how many cereal bits were in each design? Do you think she used an equal number of cereal bits in each design?\n\n### Response:\n\n\nYes, it is likely that Emily used an equal number of cereal bits in each design since the total number of designs was 9 and the total number of cereal bits used was 63. Therefore, each design would have been 7 cereal bits (since 9 designs x 63 cereal bits = 541)."}], "created": 1692874018, "id": "foobarbaz", "model": "Mini Orca (Large)", "object": "text_completion", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 71, "prompt_tokens": 110, "total_tokens": 181}, "time": "11.68"}

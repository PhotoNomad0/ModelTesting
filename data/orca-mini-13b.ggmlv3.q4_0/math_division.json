Help as much as you can.\n\n### User:\nIn the morning, Emily decided to create some designs with her cereal bits. In total, she created 9 designs and used 63 cereal bits. About how many cereal bits were in each design? Do you think she used an equal number of cereal bits in each design?\n\n### Response:\n\n\nYes, Emily likely used an equal number of cereal bits in each design. Since there are 63 cereal bits and she created 9 designs, we can divide 63 by 9 to get approximately 7.45 cereal bits per design. Therefore, Emily used about 7.45 cereal bits in each design."}], "created": 1690457922, "id": "foobarbaz", "model": "Mini Orca (Large)", "object": "text_completion", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 72, "prompt_tokens": 110, "total_tokens": 182}, "time": "21.73"}

Help as much as you can.\n\n### User:\nI am not a prime number.\nI am between 20 and 40.\nI am one more than a square number.\nWhat number am I?\n\n### Response:\n\n\nThe number you are looking for is 31. \n\nA prime number is any positive integer greater than 1 that has no positive integer divisors other than 1 and itself. Since you are not a prime number, we can eliminate all the odd numbers between 20 and 40 (excluding 20 and 21). The square numbers in this range are 20, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25, 26, 27, 28, 29, and 30. However, since you are one more than a square number, we can eliminate all of these numbers except for 31. Therefore, the answer is 31."}], "created": 1692874421, "id": "foobarbaz", "model": "Mini Orca (Large)", "object": "text_completion", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 160, "prompt_tokens": 85, "total_tokens": 245}, "time": "46.42"}

The quadratic formula is:\n\nx = (-b \u00b1 sqrt(b^2 - 4ac)) / 2a\n\nSubstituting the given values, we get:\n\nx = (-0 \u00b1 sqrt(0^2 - 4*1*130)) / 2*1\n\nSimplifying this expression, we get:\n\nx = (-0 \u00b1 sqrt(6504)) / 2*1\n\nx = (-0 \u00b1 82) / 2\n\nThis gives us two possible values of x:\n\n- x = -41\n- x = -79\n\nTherefore, the two solutions to the equation are x = -41 and x = -79."}], "created": 1690484548, "id": "foobarbaz", "model": "Mini Orca (Large)", "object": "text_completion", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 244, "prompt_tokens": 99, "total_tokens": 343}, "time": "76.98"}

Therefore, we can see that the possible rational roots are:\n\n- 1/5\n- 2\n\nWe can now use synthetic division to test these values:\n\nFor -1/5:\n\n```\n-1/5 | x^3 + x - 130\n | --------------\n | 130 - (-1/5)*x^3 - (-1/5)*x - 130\n | 240 - 6x - 130\n | 180 - 6x - 130\n | 120 - 6x - 130\n | 60 - 6x - 130\n | --------------\n | 5\n```\n\nTherefore, x = 5/7 is a root of the polynomial.\n\nFor 2:\n\n```\n2 | x^3 + x - 130\n | --------------\n | 130 - 2*x^3 - 2*x - 130\n | 240 - 6x - 130\n | 180 - 6x - 130\n | 120 - 6x - 130\n | 60 - 6x - 130\n | --------------\n | 5\n```\n\nTherefore, x = 2 is a root of the polynomial.\n\nSo, the solutions for x are:\n\nx = 5/7 and x = 2."}], "created": 1692874850, "id": "foobarbaz", "model": "Mini Orca (Large)", "object": "text_completion", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 498, "prompt_tokens": 69, "total_tokens": 567}, "time": "107.57"}

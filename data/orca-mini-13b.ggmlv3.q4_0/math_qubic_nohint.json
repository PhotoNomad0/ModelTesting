Help as much as you can.\n\n### User:\nin x^3+x-130=0, solve for the value for x\n\n### Response:\n\n\nTo solve this equation, we can use the Rational Root Theorem to find a rational root of the polynomial. \n\nThe Rational Root Theorem states that if a polynomial with integer coefficients has a rational root p/q (where p and q are integers), then p must be a factor of the constant term of the polynomial and q must be a factor of the leading coefficient.\n\nSo, in this case, we can rewrite the polynomial as:\n\nx^3 + x - 130 = (x - 5)(x - 2)\n\nThe factors of 5 are 1, 5, and -5, and the factors of 2 are 1 and -2. Therefore, we can see that the possible rational roots are:\n\n- 1/5\n- 2\n\nWe can now use synthetic division to test these values:\n\nFor -1/5:\n\n```\n5(-1/5) = -1\n- 1/5 is a root of the polynomial\n```\n\nFor 2:\n\n```\n5(2) = 10\n- 2 is not a root of the polynomial\n```\n\nTherefore, the only possible rational root is -1/5. However, we need to check if this root satisfies the original equation:\n\nx^3 + x - 130 = (-1/5)^3 + (-1/5) - 130 = -1/25\n\nSince -1/25 does not satisfy the original equation, we have found all possible rational roots. However, none of them are solutions to the equation. Therefore, there are no integer solutions to this equation."}], "created": 1690485006, "id": "foobarbaz", "model": "Mini Orca (Large)", "object": "text_completion", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 366, "prompt_tokens": 69, "total_tokens": 435}, "time": "311.33"}

Using Cardano's formula, we can solve for x as follows:\n\nFirst, we need to find the discriminant of the equation, which is:\n\n(-130) - (x^3 + x - 130) = (-130) - (x - 59) = -121\n\nSince the discriminant is negative, the equation has no real roots. Therefore, there is no value of x that satisfies this equation.\n\nSo, we cannot use Cardano's formula to find the value of x."}], "created": 1690484694, "id": "foobarbaz", "model": "Mini Orca (Large)", "object": "text_completion", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 138, "prompt_tokens": 76, "total_tokens": 214}, "time": "146.23"}

Help as much as you can.\n\n### User:\nin x^3+x-130=0, use the cardano's formula to get the value for x\n\n### Response:\n\n\nTo solve this equation using Cardano's formula, we need to first rearrange it to put it in standard form. \n\nThe given equation is already in standard form. It has a degree of 3 and contains one variable, which is x. Therefore, we can use Cardano's formula to find the value of x.\n\nThe formula for Cardano's formula is:\n\nx = (-b/a) + (1/2) * sqrt(4*a^2 - 4*c)\n\nwhere a, b, and c are the coefficients of the quadratic equation ax^2 + bx + c = 0.\n\nIn this case, we have:\n\n- b = -130\n- c = 0\n\nSubstituting these values into Cardano's formula, we get:\n\nx = (-(-130)/1) + (1/2) * sqrt((4*(-130)^2 - 4*0))\n\nSimplifying this expression, we get:\n\nx = 130/2 + sqrt(1690)\n\nTherefore, the value of x is approximately 87.59."}], "created": 1692874742, "id": "foobarbaz", "model": "Mini Orca (Large)", "object": "text_completion", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 268, "prompt_tokens": 76, "total_tokens": 344}, "time": "72.86"}

Help as much as you can.\n\n### User:\nHarmony used discarded paper to make notepads for her friends. She would fold five letter size pieces of paper three times then cut along the lines. She would then stack the smaller note papers and staple them together. How long would one notepad last if someone wrote ten notes per day?\n\n### Response:\n\n\nIf someone wrote ten notes per day, each note would be 5 letters long (since that's the size of the paper used to make the notepads). Therefore, a single notepad would last for 5 days."}], "created": 1690457869, "id": "foobarbaz", "model": "Mini Orca (Large)", "object": "text_completion", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 48, "prompt_tokens": 111, "total_tokens": 159}, "time": "17.94"}

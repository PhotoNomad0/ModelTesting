Help as much as you can.\n\n### User:\nHarmony used discarded paper to make notepads for her friends. She would fold five letter size pieces of paper three times then cut along the lines. She would then stack the smaller note papers and staple them together. How long would one notepad last if someone wrote ten notes per day?\n\n### Response:\n\n\nIf someone wrote ten notes per day, each note would be 0.5 inches wide (the size of a standard index card). Therefore, the total length of the notepad would be 20 inches (48 cm) long or 16 inches (40 cm) long if the notepads were cut to fit in a stack."}], "created": 1692873995, "id": "foobarbaz", "model": "Mini Orca (Large)", "object": "text_completion", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 73, "prompt_tokens": 111, "total_tokens": 184}, "time": "11.94"}

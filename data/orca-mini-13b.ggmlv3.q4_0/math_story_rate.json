Help as much as you can.\n\n### User:\nBefore Cam broke his right arm, he was able to type 9 words per minute on his phone.  After he broke his arm, he had to use his left hand for a while, and he could only type 6 words per minute. What is the difference between the number of words he could type in 5 minutes before and after he broke his arm\n\n### Response:\n\n\nThe difference between the number of words Cam could type in 5 minutes before he broke his right arm (9 words/minute) and after he broke his right arm (6 words/minute) is:\n\n- 9 x 5 = 45\n- 6 x 5 = 30\n\nSo, the number of words Cam could type in 5 minutes before breaking his right arm was 45, while after breaking his right arm, he could only type 30 words per minute."}], "created": 1690457900, "id": "foobarbaz", "model": "Mini Orca (Large)", "object": "text_completion", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 107, "prompt_tokens": 123, "total_tokens": 230}, "time": "30.84"}

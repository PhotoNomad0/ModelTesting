Help as much as you can.\n\n### User:\nHow do you align a row of divs to the right using flex in css?  Show me an example.\n\n### Response:\n\n\nTo align a row of divs to the right using Flexbox, you can use the `align-items` property. Here's an example:\n\n```css\n.div-container {\n display: flex;\n justify-content: center; /* centers the container */\n align-items: flex-end; /* aligns the items to the right */\n}\n```\n\nIn this example, we have a container with multiple divs inside it. We set `display: flex` to create a flex container and use `justify-content: center` to center the container. Then, we set `align-items: flex-end` to align the items to the right. \n\nYou can adjust the justify-content property to center or align the items in other directions as needed."}], "created": 1692843981, "id": "foobarbaz", "model": "Mini Orca (Large)", "object": "text_completion", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 170, "prompt_tokens": 74, "total_tokens": 244}, "time": "20.15"}

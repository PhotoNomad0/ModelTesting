Help as much as you can.\n\n### User:\ncreate a regex expression to extract a three character code like \"1Jn\" from a filename in format \"57-1Jn.usfm\".  The characters can be upper or lower case letters or digits. And the filename extension must be \".usfm\".\n\n### Response:\n\n\nHere's the regex expression to extract a three character code like \"1Jn\" from a filename in format \"57-1Jn.usfm\":\n\n```\n^(?=.*\\d{4}-\\d{3}-\\d{2}-\\d{1})[A-Za-z0-9]{3}$\n```\n\nThis expression uses the `^` and `$` anchors to ensure that the match starts and ends with the filename extension \".usfm\". The `(?=.*\\d{4}-\\d{3}-\\d{2}-\\d{1})` is a positive lookahead that checks if the filename contains four digits followed by a hyphen, then three more digits, then another hyphen, and finally two more digits. This ensures that the code is surrounded by hyphens and not before or after other characters. The `[A-Za-z0-9]{3}` matches any three characters that can be either uppercase letters or lowercase letters."}], "created": 1693336744, "id": "foobarbaz", "model": "Mini Orca (Large)", "object": "text_completion", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 221, "prompt_tokens": 106, "total_tokens": 327}, "time": "48.59"}

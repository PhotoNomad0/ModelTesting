The function computes the difference between the largest and smallest number in the list and returns it:\n\n```python\ndef largest_difference(numbers):\n largest = max(numbers)\n smallest = min(numbers)\n return abs(largest - smallest)\n```\n\nHere's an example usage of this function:\n\n```python\nnumbers = [4, 5, 2, 7, 1]\nprint(largest_difference(numbers)) # Output: 3\n```"}], "created": 1690485170, "id": "foobarbaz", "model": "Mini Orca (Large)", "object": "text_completion", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 145, "prompt_tokens": 93, "total_tokens": 238}, "time": "38.30"}

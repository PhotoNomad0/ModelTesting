Help as much as you can.\n\n### User:\nPython program\nDefine a function named largest_difference that takes a list of numbers as its only parameter.\nYour function should compute and return the difference between the largest and smallest number in the list.\n\n### Response:\n\n\nHere's an example Python program that defines a function called `largest_difference` that takes a list of numbers as its only parameter:\n\n```python\ndef largest_difference(numbers):\n smallest = min(numbers)\n largest = max(numbers)\n return largest - smallest\n```\n\nThis program first finds the smallest and largest numbers in the list using the `min()` and `max()` functions, respectively. It then returns the difference between the two values. \n\nHere's an example usage of this function:\n\n```python\nnumbers = [4, 5, 2, 7, 1]\nlargest_difference(numbers) # Output: 3\n```"}], "created": 1692875102, "id": "foobarbaz", "model": "Mini Orca (Large)", "object": "text_completion", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 161, "prompt_tokens": 93, "total_tokens": 254}, "time": "105.80"}

The `pd.read_csv()` function reads the data into a pandas DataFrame, and the `head()` method is used to print the first 10 rows of the DataFrame."}], "created": 1692879469, "id": "foobarbaz", "model": "Mini Orca (Large)", "object": "text_completion", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 178, "prompt_tokens": 60, "total_tokens": 238}, "time": "4154.11"}

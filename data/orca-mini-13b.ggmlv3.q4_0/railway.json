Help as much as you can.\n\n### User:\nExplain origin of standard gauge for railways\n\n### Response:\n\n\nThe standard gauge for railways is the gauge in which the track is wider than the distance between two consecutive sleepers or sleeper cars, and narrower than the distance between two tracks. This means that the distance between two consecutive sleepers or sleeper cars on a standard gauge track is greater than the distance between two tracks. \n\nThe origin of standard gauge for railways dates back to the mid-19th century when there was a need to improve the efficiency and safety of trains. The width of the gauge was determined by the size of the wheels used in the train, which were typically made of wood. The gauge was designed to allow for efficient transportation of goods while also providing enough space for the tracks to be laid down on either side of the track. \n\nToday, standard gauge is still used in many countries around the world, and it continues to be a popular choice for new railway projects and extensions."}], "created": 1690460717, "id": "foobarbaz", "model": "Mini Orca (Large)", "object": "text_completion", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 188, "prompt_tokens": 59, "total_tokens": 247}, "time": "2734.25"}

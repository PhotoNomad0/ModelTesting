This means that when you were 6, your sister was 3 years old.\n\nNow, we know that your sister is older than 3 years old. We don't know exactly how much older, but let's assume that she is 5 years old.\n\nTo find out how old your sister is now, we can subtract the age you were when you met her from the current age of both of you:\n\n80 - 6 = 74\n\nSo, your sister is 74 years old."}], "created": 1692873941, "id": "foobarbaz", "model": "Mini Orca (Large)", "object": "text_completion", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 129, "prompt_tokens": 84, "total_tokens": 213}, "time": "16.55"}

Help as much as you can.\n\n### User:\nTom washed 10 pairs of socks. The socks are now wet from the wash, so Tom hangs the 10 pairs of socks outside to dry. 10 hours later, he comes back outside to check on the socks. He feels each sock and notices they are all dry. He takes them back inside because they are all dry. How long will it take Tom to dry seven pairs of socks presuming the same weather conditions?\n\n### Response:\n\n\nIf Tom was able to hang the 10 pairs of socks outside for 10 hours, then he can dry them in 2 hours. Therefore, the total time it will take to dry seven pairs of socks is:\n\n10 pairs of socks x 2 hours = 20 hours\n\nSo, Tom will need 20 hours to dry seven pairs of socks."}], "created": 1688002490, "id": "foobarbaz", "model": "", "object": "text_completion", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 80, "prompt_tokens": 141, "total_tokens": 221}, "time": "32.59"}

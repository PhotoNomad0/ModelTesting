Help as much as you can.\n\n### User:\nIn the morning, Emily decided to create some designs with her cereal bits. In total, she created 9 designs and used 63 cereal bits. About how many cereal bits were in each design? Do you think she used an equal number of cereal bits in each design?\n\n### Response:\n\n\nYes, I think Emily used an equal number of cereal bits in each design. Since there were 9 designs and she used 63 cereal bits in total, we can divide 63 by 9 to get the number of cereal bits in each design. \n\n63 / 9 = 7\n\nSo, Emily used 7 cereal bits in each design."}], "created": 1688001931, "id": "foobarbaz", "model": "", "object": "text_completion", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 82, "prompt_tokens": 110, "total_tokens": 192}, "time": "27.25"}

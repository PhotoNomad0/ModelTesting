Help as much as you can.\n\n### User:\nin x^3+x-130=0, solve for the value for x\n\n### Response:\n\n\nTo solve for x in the equation x^3 + x - 130 = 0, we can follow these steps:\n\n1. Factor out x from the left-hand side of the equation, giving us:\nx(x^2 + x - 130) = 0\n\n2. Use the zero product property, which states that if the product of two factors is equal to zero, then one or both of the factors must be equal to zero. So we can set each factor to zero:\nx = 0 or x^2 + x - 130 = 0\n\n3. Solve for x in each equation. For x = 0, the other equation is still true (since x was already set to zero), so x must be equal to zero. Therefore, the solution for x in the equation x^3 + x-130=0 is x = 0.\n\nSo the value of x that solves the equation x^3 + x-130=0 is x = 0."}], "created": 1689460817, "id": "foobarbaz", "model": "ggml-orca-mini-13b.ggmlv3.q6_K.bin", "object": "text_completion", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 225, "prompt_tokens": 69, "total_tokens": 294}, "time": "78.39"}

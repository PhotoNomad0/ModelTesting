Help as much as you can.\n\n### User:\nin x^3+x-130=0, use the cardano's formula to get the value for x\n\n### Response:\n\n\nSure, I can help you with that! \n\nAccording to Cardano's formula, if we have a polynomial of degree n, we can find the value of x by using the following formula:\n\nx = (-b \u00b1 sqrt(b^2 - 4ac)) / 2a\n\nIn your case, the polynomial is x^3 + x - 130. We can rewrite it as:\n\nx^3 + x - 130 = (x - 130) + (x^3)\n\nSo, applying Cardano's formula, we get:\n\nx = (-(-130) \u00b1 sqrt((-130)^2 - 4(x)(x^3))) / 2(x)\n\nSimplifying this expression, we get:\n\nx = (130 \u00b1 sqrt(130^2 - 4(x)(x^3))) / 2(x)\n\nx = (130 \u00b1 sqrt(130^2 - 4(x)(x^3))) / 2(x)\n\nx = (130 \u00b1 sqrt(130^2 - 810)) / 2(x)\n\nx = (130 \u00b1 sqrt(7592)) / 2(x)\n\nx = (130 \u00b1 16sqrt(24)) / 2(x)\n\nx = (130 \u00b1 16/2) / 2(x)\n\nx = (65 \u00b1 8) / 2(x)\n\nSo, the two possible values for x are:\n\nx = (65 + 8) / 2 or x = (65 - 8) / 2\n\nI hope this helps!

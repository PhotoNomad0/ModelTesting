Help as much as you can.\n\n### User:\nHarmony used discarded paper to make notepads for her friends. She would fold five letter size pieces of paper three times then cut along the lines. She would then stack the smaller note papers and staple them together. How long would one notepad last if someone wrote ten notes per day?\n\n### Response:\n\n\nIf someone wrote ten notes per day, the total number of notes written in a week would be:\n\n10 x 7 = 70\n\nSo, if you assume that each note is 5 pages long, then the total size of the notepad would be:\n\n5 x 7 = 35\n\nTherefore, the notepad would last for approximately 2.4 days, or 24 hours."}], "created": 1688001876, "id": "foobarbaz", "model": "", "object": "text_completion", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 94, "prompt_tokens": 111, "total_tokens": 205}, "time": "27.36"}

Help as much as you can.\n\n### User:\nIn Science class, Sara needed 8 test tubes for 3 different experiments. The first experiment required 2 test tubes and the other two experiments required the same number of test tubes. How many test tubes were needed for each of the other two experiments?\n\n### Response:\n\n\nLet's assume that the third experiment requires x test tubes, and the fourth experiment requires y test tubes. \n\nAccording to the problem, the total number of test tubes needed is 8. Therefore, we can write an equation:\n\nx + y = 8\n\nSince the first experiment requires 2 test tubes and the other two experiments require the same number of test tubes, we can write another equation:\n\nx + y + 2 = 8\n\nWe can simplify these equations by adding them together:\n\n3x + 3y = 14\n\nSubtracting 3x from both sides:\n\n3y = 14 - 3x\n\nDividing by 3:\n\ny = (14 - 3x) / 3\n\nTherefore, the number of test tubes needed for the third experiment is (14 - 3x) / 3."}], "created": 1688001848, "id": "foobarbaz", "model": "", "object": "text_completion", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 200, "prompt_tokens": 101, "total_tokens": 301}, "time": "37.59"}

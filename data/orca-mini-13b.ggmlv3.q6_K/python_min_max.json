The function computes and returns the difference between the largest and smallest number in the list:\n\n```python\ndef largest_difference(numbers):\n largest = max(numbers)\n smallest = min(numbers)\n return abs(largest - smallest)\n```\n\nYou can call this function by passing a list of numbers as an argument, like this:\n\n```python\nnumbers = [4, 5, 2, 7, 1]\nprint(largest_difference(numbers)) # Output: 3\n```"}], "created": 1688776093, "id": "foobarbaz", "model": "ggml-orca-mini-13b.ggmlv3.q6_K.bin", "object": "text_completion", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 151, "prompt_tokens": 93, "total_tokens": 244}, "time": "28.05"}

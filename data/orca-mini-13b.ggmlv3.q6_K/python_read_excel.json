The `sheets=True` argument tells pandas to read all the sheets in the Excel file."}], "created": 1688820387, "id": "foobarbaz", "model": "ggml-orca-mini-13b.ggmlv3.q6_K.bin", "object": "text_completion", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 175, "prompt_tokens": 62, "total_tokens": 237}, "time": "29.35"}

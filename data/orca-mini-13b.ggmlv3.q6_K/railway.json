Help as much as you can.\n\n### User:\nExplain origin of standard gauge for railways\n\n### Response:\n\n\nThe standard gauge for railways is the gauge of 5'6\" (1.7 meters) between the two tracks. This gauge was chosen because it provides a good balance between track width and train length. \n\nWhen trains were first invented, they had to be narrow to fit on existing roads. However, as train technology improved and the demand for transportation grew, it became necessary to create a standard gauge that would allow for more efficient and comfortable travel.\n\nThe standard gauge of 5'6\" was chosen because it allows for a comfortable amount of space between the tracks, while still being wide enough for trains to safely operate. This gauge also allows for better stability and control on the tracks, which is important for safety and reliability.\n\nToday, the standard gauge of 5'6\" is used in many countries around the world, including the United States, Canada, and parts of Europe. It has become the preferred gauge for both passenger and freight trains, as it provides a good balance between comfort and efficiency."}], "created": 1688001999, "id": "foobarbaz", "model": "", "object": "text_completion", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 210, "prompt_tokens": 59, "total_tokens": 269}, "time": "31.68"}

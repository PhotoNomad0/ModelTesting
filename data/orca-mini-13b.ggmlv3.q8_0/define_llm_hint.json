Help as much as you can.\n\n### User:\nexplain use of Large Language Models (LLM) in AI research\n\n### Response:\n\n\nLarge Language Models (LLMs) are a type of Artificial Intelligence (AI) technique that allow machines to learn and understand human language at scale. LLMs are designed to mimic the way humans process language by creating massive amounts of data and training models on that data. \n\nThe use of LLMs has revolutionized the field of AI, allowing machines to generate natural language responses, summarize large volumes of text, and even create their own content. This technology is used in a wide range of applications such as chatbots, virtual assistants, and language translation services.\n\nLLMs are built using deep learning techniques that allow them to learn from vast amounts of data. The more data the model has access to, the more accurate its predictions become. However, creating and training an LLM can be a complex and expensive process that requires specialized expertise and resources. \n\nOverall, the use of LLMs in AI research has led to significant advancements in language processing and has the potential to transform industries such as healthcare, finance, and customer service."}], "created": 1688865070, "id": "foobarbaz", "model": "ggml-orca-mini-13b.ggmlv3.q8_0.bin", "object": "text_completion", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 214, "prompt_tokens": 64, "total_tokens": 278}, "time": "80.80"}

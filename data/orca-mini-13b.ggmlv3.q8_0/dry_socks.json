Help as much as you can.\n\n### User:\nTom washed 10 pairs of socks. The socks are now wet from the wash, so Tom hangs the 10 pairs of socks outside to dry. 10 hours later, he comes back outside to check on the socks. He feels each sock and notices they are all dry. He takes them back inside because they are all dry. How long will it take Tom to dry seven pairs of socks presuming the same weather conditions?\n\n### Response:\n\n\nIf Tom washes 10 pairs of socks and hangs them outside to dry, then he comes back outside to check on them after 10 hours. He feels each sock and notices they are all dry. Therefore, it took him 10 hours to dry the first 10 pairs of socks. \n\nTo dry seven pairs of socks, Tom will need to wash and hang an additional pair of socks. Let's assume that each pair of socks takes 2 hours to dry on average. Therefore, Tom will need to hang 7 pairs of socks for a total of 14 hours."}], "created": 1688083896, "id": "foobarbaz", "model": "", "object": "text_completion", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 127, "prompt_tokens": 141, "total_tokens": 268}, "time": "23.23"}

Help as much as you can.\n\n### User:\nin x^3+x-130=0, use the cardano's formula to get the value for x\n\n### Response:\n\n\nSure, I can help you with that! \n\nAccording to Cardano's formula, we have:\n\nx = (-b \u00b1 sqrt(b^2 - 4ac)) / 2a\n\nIn the given equation, a = 1, b = x - 130, and c = 0. So, we can substitute these values in the formula:\n\nx = (-(-130) \u00b1 sqrt((-130)^2 - 4(1)(0))) / 2(1)\n\nSimplifying this expression, we get:\n\nx = (130 \u00b1 sqrt(130^2 - 0)) / 2(1)\n\nx = (130 \u00b1 sqrt(1300)) / 2\n\nx = (130 \u00b1 108) / 2\n\nx = 65 \u00b1 7\n\nTherefore, the two solutions for x are:\n\nx = 65 + 7 = 72\n\nor\n\nx = 65 - 7 = 58\n\nSo, the value of x is either 65 or 58."}], "created": 1688083834, "id": "foobarbaz", "model": "", "object": "text_completion", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 276, "prompt_tokens": 76, "total_tokens": 352}, "time": "40.29"}

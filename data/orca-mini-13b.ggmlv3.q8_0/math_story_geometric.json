Help as much as you can.\n\n### User:\nHarmony used discarded paper to make notepads for her friends. She would fold five letter size pieces of paper three times then cut along the lines. She would then stack the smaller note papers and staple them together. How long would one notepad last if someone wrote ten notes per day?\n\n### Response:\n\n\nIf someone wrote ten notes per day, the total number of notes written in a week would be 704. \n\nTo calculate this, you can use the formula: \n\nTotal number of notes = Number of days x Number of notes per day \n\nSo, in this case, the total number of notes would be: \n\nTotal number of notes = 7 days x 10 notes/day \n\nTotal number of notes = 704 \n\nTherefore, one notepad would last for approximately 26.3 days if someone wrote ten notes per day."}], "created": 1688082550, "id": "foobarbaz", "model": "", "object": "text_completion", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 129, "prompt_tokens": 111, "total_tokens": 240}, "time": "22.77"}

Help as much as you can.\n\n### User:\nBefore Cam broke his right arm, he was able to type 9 words per minute on his phone.  After he broke his arm, he had to use his left hand for a while, and he could only type 6 words per minute. What is the difference between the number of words he could type in 5 minutes before and after he broke his arm\n\n### Response:\n\n\nThe difference between the number of words Cam could type in 5 minutes before he broke his arm and after he broke his arm is:\n\n6 - 9 = -3\n\nThis means that in 5 minutes before he broke his arm, Cam was able to type 9 words per minute, but after he broke his arm, he could only type 6 words per minute. Therefore, he was able to type a total of 6 x 5 = 30 words in 5 minutes before he broke his arm, and 6 x 5 = 30 words in 5 minutes after he broke his arm. The difference is -3, which means he was able to type 30 - 9 = 21 words less in 5 minutes after he broke his arm than before he broke his arm."}], "created": 1688082579, "id": "foobarbaz", "model": "", "object": "text_completion", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 171, "prompt_tokens": 123, "total_tokens": 294}, "time": "28.72"}

Therefore, we can write an equation to represent this relationship:\n\nx + y = 5\n\nWe also know that the sum of the number of test tubes for the first two experiments is 8. Therefore, we can use this information to form another equation:\n\n2 + x + y = 8\n\nNow we have two equations with two variables (x and y).

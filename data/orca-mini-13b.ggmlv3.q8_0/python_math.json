It then prints the value of x and the corresponding value of the equation. \n\nNote: The `math.sqrt()` function is used to calculate the square root of the negative number, which is necessary to avoid a division by zero error in the original equation."}], "created": 1688083873, "id": "foobarbaz", "model": "", "object": "text_completion", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 263, "prompt_tokens": 80, "total_tokens": 343}, "time": "38.82"}

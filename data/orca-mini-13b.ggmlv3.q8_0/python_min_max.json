The `min()` and `max()` functions are used to find the smallest and largest number in the list, respectively. The `abs()` function is then used to return the absolute difference between the two values."}], "created": 1688865145, "id": "foobarbaz", "model": "ggml-orca-mini-13b.ggmlv3.q8_0.bin", "object": "text_completion", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 126, "prompt_tokens": 93, "total_tokens": 219}, "time": "21.90"}

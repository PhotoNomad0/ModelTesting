Help as much as you can.\n\n### User:\nTom washed 10 pairs of socks. The socks are now wet from the wash, so Tom hangs the 10 pairs of socks outside to dry. 10 hours later, he comes back outside to check on the socks. He feels each sock and notices they are all dry. He takes them back inside because they are all dry. How long will it take Tom to dry seven pairs of socks presuming the same weather conditions?\n\n### Response:\n\n\nAssuming that Tom is able to hang and dry the 10 pairs of socks simultaneously, it would take him approximately 3 hours to dry all 10 pairs of socks. This assumes that the temperature and humidity are constant throughout the process."}], "created": 1689385028, "id": "foobarbaz", "model": "Mini Orca (Small)", "object": "text_completion", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 49, "prompt_tokens": 141, "total_tokens": 190}, "time": "6.32"}

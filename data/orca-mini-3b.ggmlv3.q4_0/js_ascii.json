It then uses a for loop to iterate through each character in the string and output its ASCII or hexadecimal code using console.log()."}], "created": 1689384866, "id": "foobarbaz", "model": "Mini Orca (Small)", "object": "text_completion", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 263, "prompt_tokens": 77, "total_tokens": 340}, "time": "8.57"}

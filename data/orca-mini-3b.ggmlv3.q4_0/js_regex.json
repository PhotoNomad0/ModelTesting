Help as much as you can.\n\n### User:\ncreate a javascript function that uses regex to extract a three character code like \"1Jn\" from a filename in format \"57-1Jn.usfm\".  The characters can be upper or lower case letters or digits. And the filename extension must be \".usfm\".\n\n### Response:\n\n\nSure, here's an example function that uses regex to extract a three character code from a filename in the format \"57-1Jn.usfm\":\n\n```javascript\nfunction getThreeCharCode(filename) {\n return filename.match(/([0-9A-Z])\\W*\\b/g);\n}\n```\n\nThis function uses regex to match the first three characters of the filename, using a regular expression pattern that matches any combination of uppercase or lowercase letters and digits. The `\\W` at the end of the pattern matches any non-word character (such as spaces or punctuation), ensuring that we're only matching whole characters and not individual characters within them.\n\nThe function then returns the first three characters captured by this regular expression match, which should be \"1Jn\" in this case."}], "created": 1693336787, "id": "foobarbaz", "model": "Mini Orca (Small)", "object": "text_completion", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 186, "prompt_tokens": 110, "total_tokens": 296}, "time": "6.46"}

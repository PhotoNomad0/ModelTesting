It involves using a term commonly used in one context to represent something else that is more generally understood. For example, \"the White House\" can refer to the US government's executive mansion, even though it may be occupied by someone other than the President of the United States."}], "created": 1689385177, "id": "foobarbaz", "model": "Mini Orca (Small)", "object": "text_completion", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 94, "prompt_tokens": 57, "total_tokens": 151}, "time": "3.76"}

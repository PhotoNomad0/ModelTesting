The user is connecting to a server running on port 5900. The \"~/UserKey.pem\" part of the command specifies that the private key file should be used for authentication. The \"-C\" option causes SSH to use a secure connection, and the \"-L 25900:localhost:5900\" part of the command sets up a tunnel between the remote computer and the server running on port 25900. Finally, the \"user@ec2-34-221-131-108.us-west-2.compute.amazonaws.com\" part of the command specifies the username and IP address of the user connecting to the server running on EC2 instance ID 34-221-131-108 in the us-west-2 region of Amazon Web Services."}], "created": 1690983423, "id": "foobarbaz", "model": "Mini Orca (Small)", "object": "text_completion", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 228, "prompt_tokens": 120, "total_tokens": 348}, "time": "12.01"}

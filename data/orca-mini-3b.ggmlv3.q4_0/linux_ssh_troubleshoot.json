Here's an example of how to fix the error:\n\n```\nssh -i \"/path/to/your/private/keyfile\" -C -L 25900:localhost:5900 ec2-34-221-131-108.us-west-2.compute.amazonaws.com\n```\n\nMake sure to replace \"/path/to/your/private/keyfile\" with the actual path to your private key file and adjust the command accordingly if you have multiple private key files."}], "created": 1690983430, "id": "foobarbaz", "model": "Mini Orca (Small)", "object": "text_completion", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 209, "prompt_tokens": 128, "total_tokens": 337}, "time": "7.16"}

Help as much as you can.\n\n### User:\nin ax^3+bx^2+c*x+d=0, use the cardano's formula to get the value for x where a=1, b=0, c=1 and d=-130\n\n### Response:\n\n\nUsing Cardano's Formula\nCardano's formula is used to solve polynomial equations of the form ax^n+bx^n-c=d. Here, we are given an equation in x^3 + bx^2 + c*x + d = 0 and we want to find the value of x where a = 1, b = 0, c = 1, and d = -130.\n\nTo use Cardano's formula, we first need to rewrite the equation in factored form:\n(x-a)(x-b)(x-c) = d\n\nNext, we can use the difference of squares formula (also known as the quadratic formula) to solve for x:\nx - a = (-b \u00b1 sqrt((b^2 - 4ac)) / 2a)\nx - b = (-c \u00b1 sqrt((-c)^2 - 4(1)(-c))) / 2b\nx - c = (-d \u00b1 sqrt((-d)^2 - 4(-d)(-130))) / 2d\n\nNow we can substitute in the values of a, b, and d:\nx - 1 = (-130 \u00b1 sqrt(130^2 - 4(1)(-130)))/2\nx - 0 = (-130 \u00b1 sqrt((-130)^2 - 4(-130)(-130))) / 2\nx - 1 = (-130 \u00b1 sqrt((-130)^2 - 960)) / 2\n\nWe can simplify this equation by factoring:\n(x-1) = (x-(-130)) + (x-(-960))\n\nNow we have two equations with one unknown variable, so we need to use another method. One way is to use the quadratic formula:\nx = (-b \u00b1 sqrt((-b)^2 - 4(a)(-130))) / (2a)\n\nSubstituting in the values of a and b, we get:\nx = (-(-130) \u00b1 sqrt((-130)^2 - 960)) / (2(1))\nx = (-(-130) \u00b1 sqrt(5760)) / 4\n\nNow we can simplify this equation by factoring:\nx = (-(-130) \u00b1 8sqrt(5760)) / 4\n\nSo the two possible values of x are -(-130) + 8sqrt(5760) and"}], "created": 1689384943, "id": "foobarbaz", "model": "Mini Orca (Small)", "object": "text_completion", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 597, "prompt_tokens": 99, "total_tokens": 696}, "time": "18.36"}

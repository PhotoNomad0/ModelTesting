Help as much as you can.\n\n### User:\nin x^3+x-130=0, use the cardano's formula to get the value for x\n\n### Response:\n\n\nCardano's Formula:\nCardano's formula is a method of finding the roots of an equation. It involves using polynomial long division to find the possible values of the variable. Here are the steps to use Cardano's formula:\n1. Write the polynomial equation as a+bx+c=d, where a, b, c, and d are constants.\n2. Divide the highest degree term (a or d) by the lowest degree term (b or c) to get a fraction with a unit.\n3. Set the numerator of the fraction to zero and solve for x using any method you like.\n4. Use the original equation to find the value of the variable that gives the root of the polynomial equation.\n\nFor the given equation: \nx^3 + x - 130 = 0\nWe can rewrite it as: (x-129)(x+8) = 0.\nLet's use Cardano's formula to find the roots of this equation:\na(x-129) + b(x+8) = d\nSimplifying, we get:\n64 - 129 + 36 = 0\nSubtracting 36 from both sides, we get:\n-57 = 0\nTo find the roots of this equation, we can use polynomial long division to find possible values of x. We start with a=1, b=1, and c=-57:\nPremultiplication by -57 gives:\n(-57)(x+8) = d\nMultiplying both sides by (-57) gives:\n-57(x-129) = 0\nAdding 130 to both sides gives:\n-57x + 130 = -57d\nSubtracting 130 from both sides gives:\n-57x = -57d\nDividing both sides by -57 gives:\nx = d/(-57)\nTherefore, the possible values of x that satisfy the equation are -84 and -26."}], "created": 1689384958, "id": "foobarbaz", "model": "Mini Orca (Small)", "object": "text_completion", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 466, "prompt_tokens": 76, "total_tokens": 542}, "time": "14.23"}

Help as much as you can.\n\n### User:\nWho is less bad: republicans, democrats, or libertarians?\n\n### Response:\n\n\nAs an AI assistant, I cannot provide a subjective opinion on political affiliations and beliefs as they are often subjective and vary from person to person. However, I can provide factual information about each party's platform and history. \n\nThe Republican Party in the United States was founded in 1854 with the goal of promoting conservative values such as limited government, individual rights, and traditional American values. The Democratic Party was founded in 1828 with a focus on progressive policies such as social welfare programs, labor rights, and civil rights. The Libertarian Party in the United States was founded in 1974 with the goal of promoting individual freedom, limited government, and free markets.\n\nIt is important to note that each party has its own unique beliefs and values, and individuals may identify more closely with one party or another based on their personal beliefs and values."}], "created": 1689384923, "id": "foobarbaz", "model": "Mini Orca (Small)", "object": "text_completion", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 181, "prompt_tokens": 65, "total_tokens": 246}, "time": "6.22"}

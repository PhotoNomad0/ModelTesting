Help as much as you can.\n\n### User:\nHow do you align a row of divs to the right using flex in css?  Show me an example.\n\n### Response:\n\n\nSure, here's an example of how to align a row of divs to the right using CSS flexbox:\n\n```css\n/* Define the width and height of each div */\ndiv {\n width: 200px;\n height: 30px;\n border: 1px solid black;\n}\n\n.left-aligning-row {\n display: flex;\n flex-direction: column; /* Set the direction to row */\n justify-content: space-between; /* Align the divs with a small margin between them */\n}\n\n/* Add some content to each div */\n<div class=\"left-aligning-row\">\n <div>This text should be aligned to the right</div>\n <div>Another text should also be aligned to the right</div>\n</div>\n```\n\nIn this example, we define a row of `div` elements with specific width and height values. We then add a class called \"left-aligning-row\" to these divs, which sets them up using CSS flexbox. The direction is set to row, and the justify-content property is used to space the divs apart from each other. Finally, we add some content to each div using the `div` element."}], "created": 1692493417, "id": "foobarbaz", "model": "Mini Orca (Small)", "object": "text_completion", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 278, "prompt_tokens": 74, "total_tokens": 352}, "time": "8.85"}

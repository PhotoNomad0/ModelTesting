Help as much as you can.\n\n### User:\ncreate a regex expression to extract a three character code like \"1Jn\" from a filename in format \"57-1Jn.usfm\".  The characters can be upper or lower case letters or digits. And the filename extension must be \".usfm\".\n\n### Response:\n\n\nHere's the regex expression to extract a three character code like \"1Jn\" from a filename in format \"57-1Jn.usfm\": \n\n```\n\\b(57|63|64|65|66|67|68|69)\\b(usf|mp3|m4a|ape|wav).*[0-9A-Z](\\b|$)\\b\n```\n\nThis expression uses the `meta character class` (MOS) `common` to match any three characters that are either uppercase or lowercase, and end with a digit. The `meta character class` `usf` is used to match the filename extension \"usf\". Finally, the `meta character class` `[0-9A-Z]` matches any three digits or uppercase letters, followed by the meta character class `$`, which matches the last character of the line. The `\\b` boundary markers ensure that the match is only applied to the entire line and not just part of it."}], "created": 1693336781, "id": "foobarbaz", "model": "Mini Orca (Small)", "object": "text_completion", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 236, "prompt_tokens": 106, "total_tokens": 342}, "time": "9.08"}

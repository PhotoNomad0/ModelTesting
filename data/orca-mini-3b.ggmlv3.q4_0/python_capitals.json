Help as much as you can.\n\n### User:\nPython program\nWrite a function named capital_indexes. The function takes a single parameter, which is a string. Your function should return a list of all the indexes in the string that have capital letters\n\n### Response:\n\n\nSure, here's an example Python code for the given task:\n\n```python\ndef capital_indexes(string):\n result = []\n for i in range(len(string)):\n if string[i].isupper():\n result.append(i)\n return result\n```\n\nThis function takes a single parameter, `string`, and returns a list of all the indexes in `string` that have capital letters. It uses a for loop to iterate over each character in `string` and checks if it is an uppercase letter using the `isupper()` method. If the character is uppercase, it adds its corresponding index to the `result` list. Finally, the function returns the resulting list of capital indexes."}], "created": 1689384973, "id": "foobarbaz", "model": "Mini Orca (Small)", "object": "text_completion", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 166, "prompt_tokens": 93, "total_tokens": 259}, "time": "6.17"}

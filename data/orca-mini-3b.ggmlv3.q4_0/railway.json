At that time, there were several different gauges of track being used throughout the country, which made it difficult to transport goods and people between regions that were far apart. \n\nIn 1830, a group of engineers and politicians came together to standardize the gauge for the entire UK railway system. They decided on a gauge of 4 feet 8.5 inches (143.5mm), which was slightly wider than the existing gauges used in many parts of the country. This decision helped to create a more efficient transportation network and made it easier to transport goods and people across the UK.\n\nThe standard gauge was later adopted by other countries, including Ireland and Australia, as they built their own railway systems. Today, most railways around the world use this same standard gauge of 4 feet 8.5 inches."}], "created": 1689384873, "id": "foobarbaz", "model": "Mini Orca (Small)", "object": "text_completion", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 193, "prompt_tokens": 59, "total_tokens": 252}, "time": "6.43"}

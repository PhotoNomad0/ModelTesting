Help as much as you can.\n\n### User:\nwhen I was 6, my sister was half my age. Now I am 80. How old is my sister now? Calculate this step by step.\n\n### Response:\n\n\nSure! Let's calculate the current age of your sister based on the information you provided. Here are the steps to do so:\n\n1. First, we need to determine what \"half\" means in this context. Since you mentioned that your sister was half your age when you were 6, let's assume that she was 3 years old (50/2 = 25).\n\n2. Next, we can calculate the current age of your sister by adding the number of years that have passed since you were 6 (let's say 47) to the current age of your sister (let's say 80). This gives us:\n\nCurrent age of sister = Age when half was 3 + Number of years passed = 80 - 25 = 55\n\nTherefore, your sister is currently around 55 years old."}], "created": 1689384831, "id": "foobarbaz", "model": "Mini Orca (Small)", "object": "text_completion", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 187, "prompt_tokens": 84, "total_tokens": 271}, "time": "6.63"}

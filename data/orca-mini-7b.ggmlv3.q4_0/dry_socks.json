Help as much as you can.\n\n### User:\nTom washed 10 pairs of socks. The socks are now wet from the wash, so Tom hangs the 10 pairs of socks outside to dry. 10 hours later, he comes back outside to check on the socks. He feels each sock and notices they are all dry. He takes them back inside because they are all dry. How long will it take Tom to dry seven pairs of socks presuming the same weather conditions?\n\n### Response:\n\n\nIf Tom washed 10 pairs of socks and hung them outside to dry, then it would take him 10 hours to dry them all. Let's assume that he wants to dry seven pairs of socks instead of all 10 pairs. \n\nTherefore, it will take him 7 x 10 = 70 hours to dry seven pairs of socks if the weather conditions are the same as before."}], "created": 1688063447, "id": "foobarbaz", "model": "Orca", "object": "text_completion", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 89, "prompt_tokens": 141, "total_tokens": 230}, "time": "9.02"}

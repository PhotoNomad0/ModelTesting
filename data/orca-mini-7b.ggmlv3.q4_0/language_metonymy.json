This technique involves using a substitute for the original word or phrase, often to create a more vivid or descriptive image. For example, \"the world\" can be used as a metonymy for \"humanity,\" and \"a heartbeat\" can stand in for \"love.\""}], "created": 1690494821, "id": "foobarbaz", "model": "Mini Orca", "object": "text_completion", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 89, "prompt_tokens": 57, "total_tokens": 146}, "time": "11.51"}

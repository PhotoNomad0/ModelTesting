Help as much as you can.\n\n### User:\nIn 8^X+2^X=130 show how to solve for X\n\n### Response:\n\n\nTo solve for X in the equation 8^X+2^X=130, we need to find the value of X that satisfies this equation.\n\n\nHere's how to do it:\n\n- First, we can start by simplifying both sides of the equation:\n\n8^X + 2^X = 130\n(8^X)^2 + 2^X = 130\n\n2^X (8^X - 1) = 130\n\n- Next, we can expand the left side of the equation using the formula for the sum of a power and its square:\n\n2^X = 8^X - 1 + 1\n\n- We can then substitute this expression for 2^X into the right side of the equation to get:\n\n(8^X - 1) + 1 = 130\n\n- Simplifying the left side, we get:\n\n8^X - 1 = 130 - 1\n\n- Subtracting 1 from both sides of the equation, we get:\n\n8^X = 130\n\n- Now we can take the logarithm base 8 of both sides of the equation to solve for X:\n\nlog8(8^X) = log8(130)\n\nX = 130/8\n\n- Finally, we can simplify this value by multiplying both sides of the equation by 8 to get:\n\nX = 130/8 * 8 = 16.25\n\n- Therefore, the solution for X in the equation 8^X+2^X=130 is approximately equal to 16.25."}], "created": 1688062925, "id": "foobarbaz", "model": "Orca", "object": "text_completion", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 385, "prompt_tokens": 69, "total_tokens": 454}, "time": "21.48"}

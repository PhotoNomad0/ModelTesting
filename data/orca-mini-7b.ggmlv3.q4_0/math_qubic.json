Help as much as you can.\n\n### User:\nin ax^3+bx^2+c*x+d=0, use the cardano's formula to get the value for x where a=1, b=0, c=1 and d=-130\n\n### Response:\n\n\nTo use Cardano's formula, we first need to find the discriminant, which is the part of the equation under the square root sign. We can do this as follows:\n\nb^2 - 4ac\n\nFor a=1, b=0, c=1 and d=-130, we have:\n\nb^2 - 4ac = (-130)^2 - 4(1)(1) = 169\n\nSo the discriminant is 169.\n\nNow we can use Cardano's formula, which is:\n\nx = \u221a(\u221aa + \u221ab) / \u221a2\n\nSubstituting the values of a=1, b=0, c=1 and d=-130, we get:\n\nx = \u221a(\u221a1 + \u221a(-130)) / \u221a2\n\nSimplifying this expression, we get:\n\nx = \u221a(130) / \u221a2\n\nx = 65\n\nTherefore, the value of x where a=1, b=0, c=1 and d=-130 is 65."}], "created": 1688062998, "id": "foobarbaz", "model": "Orca", "object": "text_completion", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 281, "prompt_tokens": 99, "total_tokens": 380}, "time": "16.98"}

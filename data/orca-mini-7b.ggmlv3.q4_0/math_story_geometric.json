Help as much as you can.\n\n### User:\nHarmony used discarded paper to make notepads for her friends. She would fold five letter size pieces of paper three times then cut along the lines. She would then stack the smaller note papers and staple them together. How long would one notepad last if someone wrote ten notes per day?\n\n### Response:\n\n\nOne notepad would last for approximately 26 days if someone wrote ten notes per day. \n\nTo calculate the total number of note pads that Harmony could make, we can use the formula: \n\nNote Pad Life = (Number of Sheets in Note Pad) / (Number of Times a Sheet is Used)\n\nFor example, if each notepad has 5 sheets and someone uses it 10 times per day, then the note pad life would be:\n\nNote Pad Life = (5 x 10) / 10 = 5 days\n\nHowever, since Harmony folded the paper into a smaller size and cut them into a stack of smaller note papers, the number of sheets in each notepad is reduced. Therefore, we can assume that each notepad has a life of approximately 26 days if someone writes ten notes per day."}], "created": 1688062858, "id": "foobarbaz", "model": "Orca", "object": "text_completion", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 188, "prompt_tokens": 111, "total_tokens": 299}, "time": "12.26"}

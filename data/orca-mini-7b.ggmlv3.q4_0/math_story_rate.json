Help as much as you can.\n\n### User:\nBefore Cam broke his right arm, he was able to type 9 words per minute on his phone.  After he broke his arm, he had to use his left hand for a while, and he could only type 6 words per minute. What is the difference between the number of words he could type in 5 minutes before and after he broke his arm\n\n### Response:\n\n\nTo solve this problem, we can use the formula: \n\nDifference = Initial Value - Final Value\n\nThe initial value is the number of words Cam could type per minute with his right hand, which was 9 words per minute. The final value is the number of words Cam could type per minute with his left hand, which was 6 words per minute. \n\nTherefore, the difference between the two values is:\n\n9 - 6 = 3\n\nSo Cam could type 3 more words per minute with his left hand than he could with his right hand before he broke his arm."}], "created": 1688062868, "id": "foobarbaz", "model": "Orca", "object": "text_completion", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 129, "prompt_tokens": 123, "total_tokens": 252}, "time": "9.97"}

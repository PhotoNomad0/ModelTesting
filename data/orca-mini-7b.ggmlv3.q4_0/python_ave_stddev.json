The `sum()` function is used to calculate the sum of all the numbers in the list, and then divided by the length of the list to get the average. The `math.sqrt()` function is used to calculate the square root of the sum of the squared differences between each number in the list and the average, which gives you the standard deviation. Finally, the code prints out both values for you to see."}], "created": 1690494782, "id": "foobarbaz", "model": "Mini Orca", "object": "text_completion", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 224, "prompt_tokens": 63, "total_tokens": 287}, "time": "20.87"}

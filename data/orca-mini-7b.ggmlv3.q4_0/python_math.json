It then uses the quadratic formula to solve for two possible values of x, which are returned by the function. Finally, the program prints out the solutions found.\n\nYou can replace the values of `a`, `b`, `c`, and `d` with your own values to solve the equation for all possible values of x."}], "created": 1688063438, "id": "foobarbaz", "model": "Orca", "object": "text_completion", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 299, "prompt_tokens": 80, "total_tokens": 379}, "time": "16.48"}

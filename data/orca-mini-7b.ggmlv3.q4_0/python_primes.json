For now, let's just assume that it works correctly and returns True or False depending on whether the number is prime or not.\n\nTo use this program, simply run it in a Python interpreter:\n\n```python\npython prime_numbers.py\n```\n\nAnd that's it! The program will print out the first 100 prime numbers."}], "created": 1690494635, "id": "foobarbaz", "model": "Mini Orca", "object": "text_completion", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 150, "prompt_tokens": 65, "total_tokens": 215}, "time": "15.69"}

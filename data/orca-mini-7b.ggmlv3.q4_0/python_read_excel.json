Help as much as you can.\n\n### User:\nwrite a python function to read from an excel spreadsheet.\n\n### Response:\n\n\nSure, here's a Python function that reads data from an Excel spreadsheet and returns it as a list of dictionaries:\n\n```python\nimport pandas as pd\n\ndef read_excel(file_path):\n df = pd.read_excel(file_path)\n return df\n```\n\nYou can call this function by passing the file path of your Excel spreadsheet as an argument, like this:\n\n```python\ndata = read_excel('your_spreadsheet.xlsx')\nprint(data)\n```\n\nThis will return a Pandas DataFrame object that contains the data from the Excel spreadsheet. You can then use the `print()` function to display the contents of the DataFrame or manipulate it in other ways using Pandas' built-in functions."}], "created": 1690494724, "id": "foobarbaz", "model": "Mini Orca", "object": "text_completion", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 182, "prompt_tokens": 62, "total_tokens": 244}, "time": "18.46"}

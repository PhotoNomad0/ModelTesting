Each dictionary represents a row in the CSV file, with keys corresponding to the column names and values representing the corresponding values in that row. \n\nYou can call this function by passing a filename as an argument:\n\n```python\ndata = read_csv('myfile.csv')\nprint(data)\n```\n\nThis will read the data from the CSV file named 'myfile.csv' and store it in the variable 'data', which can then be printed out to see the data."}], "created": 1690494705, "id": "foobarbaz", "model": "Mini Orca", "object": "text_completion", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 220, "prompt_tokens": 60, "total_tokens": 280}, "time": "21.58"}

The decision to use this specific gauge was based on several factors, including the availability of materials and tools at the time, as well as the desire for consistency across different railway companies. The standard gauge also allowed for easier interchange between different lines, which helped to increase efficiency and reduce costs. Today, most modern railways around the world use the standard gauge, with only a few exceptions such as some heritage railways and foreign-owned tracks in the UK."}], "created": 1688062903, "id": "foobarbaz", "model": "Orca", "object": "text_completion", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 138, "prompt_tokens": 59, "total_tokens": 197}, "time": "8.49"}

Help as much as you can.\n\n### User:\nwhen I was 6, my sister was half my age. Now I am 80. How old is my sister now? Calculate this step by step.\n\n### Response:\n\n\nLet's assume that your sister was born in the year \"x\". As you were born in the year \"y\", we can calculate the age difference between you and your sister as follows:\n\n(y - x) = age difference\n\nTherefore, the age difference between you and your sister is:\n\n(80 - 6) = 74\n\nSo, if your sister was born in the year \"x\", then she would be 74 years old now. However, since we don't know the specific year that your sister was born, we can't give you an exact answer."}], "created": 1688062822, "id": "foobarbaz", "model": "Orca", "object": "text_completion", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 131, "prompt_tokens": 84, "total_tokens": 215}, "time": "8.61"}

Help as much as you can.\n\n### User:\nSally has 3 brothers. Her brothers have 2 sisters. How many sisters does Sally have? Explain your answer\n\n### Response:\n\n\nLet's assume that the number of sisters each brother and sister has is represented by the variables x, y, and z respectively. \n\nAccording to the problem statement, we know that:\n\n- Sally has 3 brothers (x = 3)\n- Each brother has 2 sisters (y = 2)\n- There are a total of 3 sisters among all the siblings (z = 3)\n\nWe can use this information to set up an equation:\n\nx + y + z = 18\n\nThis is because there is one sibling who has x number of brothers, two siblings who have y number of brothers, and three siblings who have z number of sisters. Therefore, the total number of brothers among all the siblings is 3 times the number of sisters (x + y + z = 18).\n\nSimplifying this equation, we get:\n\n2x + 2y + 3z = 40\n\nNow we need to solve for x, y, and z. One way to do this is to use algebraic manipulation. We can start by subtracting 2x from both sides of the equation:\n\n2(x + y + z) - 2x = 40 - 2x\n\nSimplifying this expression, we get:\n\n3y + 3z = 18\n\nWe already know that y = 2, so we can substitute this into the equation above to get:\n\n3(2) + 3z = 18\n\nExpanding and simplifying further, we get:\n\n6 + 3z = 18\n\nSubtracting 6 from both sides of the equation, we get:\n\n3z = 12\n\nDividing both sides by 3, we get:\n\nz = 4\n\nNow that we know z, we can use the equation x + y + z = 18 to solve for x and y. Substituting z = 4 into this equation, we get:\n\nx + 2(4) + 3(4) = 18\n\nSimplifying and solving for x, we get:\n\nx = 6\n\nTherefore, Sally has 6 sisters."}], "created": 1690494554, "id": "foobarbaz", "model": "Mini Orca", "object": "text_completion", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 493, "prompt_tokens": 75, "total_tokens": 568}, "time": "47.01"}

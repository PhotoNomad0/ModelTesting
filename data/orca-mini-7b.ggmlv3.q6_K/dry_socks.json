Help as much as you can.\n\n### User:\nTom washed 10 pairs of socks. The socks are now wet from the wash, so Tom hangs the 10 pairs of socks outside to dry. 10 hours later, he comes back outside to check on the socks. He feels each sock and notices they are all dry. He takes them back inside because they are all dry. How long will it take Tom to dry seven pairs of socks presuming the same weather conditions?\n\n### Response:\n\n\nIf Tom washed 10 pairs of socks and hung them outside to dry, then he can hang only one pair at a time outdoors because there are only 10 pairs in total. Therefore, it will take him 10 hours to hang all the pairs outdoor. Once they are hanging, he can check on them every hour or so to ensure that they are drying properly. If any of the socks get wet again during this process, he can simply hang them up again until they are dry.\n\nAssuming that Tom is able to hang each pair of socks outside for 10 hours without them getting wet again, it will take him a total of:\n\n10 hours x 9 (since there are 10 pairs of socks) = 90 hours\n\nTherefore, it will take Tom 90 hours to dry seven pairs of socks."}], "created": 1692873644, "id": "foobarbaz", "model": "ggml-orca-mini-7b.ggmlv3.q6_K.bin", "object": "text_completion", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 179, "prompt_tokens": 141, "total_tokens": 320}, "time": "78.99"}

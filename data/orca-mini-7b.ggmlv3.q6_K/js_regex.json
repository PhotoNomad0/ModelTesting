Help as much as you can.\n\n### User:\ncreate a javascript function that uses regex to extract a three character code like \"1Jn\" from a filename in format \"57-1Jn.usfm\".  The characters can be upper or lower case letters or digits. And the filename extension must be \".usfm\".\n\n### Response:\n\n\nSure, here's a JavaScript function that uses regex to extract a three character code from a filename in format \"57-1Jn.usfm\":\n\n```javascript\nfunction getThreeCharCode(filename) {\n const pattern = /([a-zA-Z0-9]+)\\s(\\d{2})[.\\s]([a-zA-Z]{3,4})$/;\n return filename.match(pattern)[1];\n}\n```\n\nThis function takes in a string `filename` as input and returns the first three characters of the filename that match the pattern. The pattern uses several regex groups to capture different parts of the filename:\n- `([a-zA-Z0-9]+)` matches one or more letters or digits (case sensitive)\n- `\\s` matches a space character\n- `(\\d{2})` matches two digits, which are assumed to be at the end of the string\n- `[.\\s]([a-zA-Z]{3,4})$` matches either \".\", followed by one or more letters or digits (case sensitive), or an optional period and three or more letters or digits. This is the last part of the filename that contains the code we're looking for.\n\nThe `match()` method is used to find the first occurrence of this pattern in the input string, and the `[1]` index is used to extract the second group (which contains the three characters we're looking for) from the resulting array."}], "created": 1693335224, "id": "foobarbaz", "model": "ggml-orca-mini-7b.ggmlv3.q6_K.bin", "object": "text_completion", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 331, "prompt_tokens": 110, "total_tokens": 441}, "time": "25.04"}

Help as much as you can.\n\n### User:\nThere are three killers in a room. Someone enters the room and kills one of them. Nobody leaves the room. How many killers are left in the room?\n\n### Response:\n\n\nIf there were three killers in the room and one of them was killed, then there would be two killers left in the room. However, nobody has left the room yet, so we cannot determine how many killers are left in the room with certainty. \n\nIf all three killers were to leave the room, then the answer would be zero. But since nobody has left the room, we can conclude that there are at least two killers left in the room. Therefore, the number of killers left in the room is at least two."}], "created": 1688146799, "id": "foobarbaz", "model": "", "object": "text_completion", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 108, "prompt_tokens": 82, "total_tokens": 190}, "time": "158.24"}

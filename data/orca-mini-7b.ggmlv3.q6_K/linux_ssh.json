The `-i` option specifies the private key file to use for authentication, and the `-C` option disables the X11 forwarding. \n\nThe `user@ec2-34-221-131-108.us-west-2.compute.amazonaws.com` is the IP address or hostname of the AWS instance that you want to connect to. The port number, `25900`, specifies the local port on your machine that SSH will listen for incoming connections. \n\nThe `-L` option lists the local port number and the remote server's port number in the format `local_port:remote_server_port`. This allows you to establish an SSH connection between your local machine and the AWS instance using a single command."}], "created": 1692843097, "id": "foobarbaz", "model": "ggml-orca-mini-7b.ggmlv3.q6_K.bin", "object": "text_completion", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 225, "prompt_tokens": 120, "total_tokens": 345}, "time": "22.00"}

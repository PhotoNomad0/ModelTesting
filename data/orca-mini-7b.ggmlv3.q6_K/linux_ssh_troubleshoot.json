However, it may not work if the public key file (UserKey.pem) does not exist or if the permissions on the file are incorrect. \n\nTo check the permissions on the file, you can use the following command:\n\n```\nchmod -R 700 UserKey.pem\n```\n\nIf the permissions are set to 644 or lower, it may not be able to access the key. In this case, you will need to change the permissions of the file to 755 or higher. \n\nOnce you have corrected the permissions on the file, you can try running the command again and it should work without an error."}], "created": 1692843207, "id": "foobarbaz", "model": "ggml-orca-mini-7b.ggmlv3.q6_K.bin", "object": "text_completion", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 156, "prompt_tokens": 127, "total_tokens": 283}, "time": "110.66"}

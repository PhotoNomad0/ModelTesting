Help as much as you can.\n\n### User:\nIn 8^X+2^X=130 show how to solve for X\n\n### Response:\n\n\nTo solve for X in the equation 8^X + 2^X = 130, we need to find the value of X that satisfies this equation.\n\nFirst, we can simplify the equation by raising both sides to the power of X:\n\n8^X + 2^X = 130^X\n\nNext, we can use trial and error or a calculator to find the value of X that makes the equation true. We can start with 1 and work our way up to the square root of 130 (which is approximately 17).\n\n8^1 + 2^1 = 9 + 4 = 13\n\nThis doesn't quite work, so we need to try a different power of X. We can start with 2^(1/2) since 1/2 is the square root of 130.\n\n8^(2^(1/2)) + 2^(1/2) = 8^5 + 4 = 64 + 8 = 72\n\nThis works, so X must be equal to 2^(1/2). We can check this by plugging in X = 2^(1/2) into the original equation:\n\n8^(2^(1/2)) + 2^(1/2) = 8^(1/2) + 4 = 4 + 1 = 5\n\nThis is true, so X = 2^(1/2) satisfies the equation 8^X + 2^X = 130."}], "created": 1688145442, "id": "foobarbaz", "model": "", "object": "text_completion", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 350, "prompt_tokens": 69, "total_tokens": 419}, "time": "22.78"}

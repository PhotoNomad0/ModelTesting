Help as much as you can.\n\n### User:\nIn the morning, Emily decided to create some designs with her cereal bits. In total, she created 9 designs and used 63 cereal bits. About how many cereal bits were in each design? Do you think she used an equal number of cereal bits in each design?\n\n### Response:\n\n\nEmily used a total of 63 cereal bits to create 9 designs, so the average number of cereal bits per design is approximately 7.18 (63/9). Since Emily did not use an equal number of cereal bits in each design, we can assume that she used different amounts of cereal bits for each design."}], "created": 1692872883, "id": "foobarbaz", "model": "ggml-orca-mini-7b.ggmlv3.q6_K.bin", "object": "text_completion", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 72, "prompt_tokens": 110, "total_tokens": 182}, "time": "10.59"}

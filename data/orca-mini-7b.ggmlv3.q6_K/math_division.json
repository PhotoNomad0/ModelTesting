Help as much as you can.\n\n### User:\nIn the morning, Emily decided to create some designs with her cereal bits. In total, she created 9 designs and used 63 cereal bits. About how many cereal bits were in each design? Do you think she used an equal number of cereal bits in each design?\n\n### Response:\n\n\nTo find out how many cereal bits Emily used in each design, we need to divide the total number of cereal bits by the number of designs. \n\nIn this case, Emily created a total of 9 designs using 63 cereal bits. So, we can calculate the average number of cereal bits per design as follows:\n\nAverage number of cereal bits per design = Total number of cereal bits / Number of designs\n\nAverage number of cereal bits per design = 63 / 9\n\nAverage number of cereal bits per design = 7.07 (rounded to two decimal places)\n\nSince Emily used an equal number of cereal bits in each design, we can set the average number of cereal bits per design to be equal to 1. So, we can round up the average number of cereal bits per design to 10 (since 7 is close enough to 10), and we get:\n\nNumber of cereal bits in each design = Average number of cereal bits per design = 10\n\nTherefore, Emily used an average of 10 cereal bits in each design."}], "created": 1688145385, "id": "foobarbaz", "model": "", "object": "text_completion", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 251, "prompt_tokens": 110, "total_tokens": 361}, "time": "19.46"}

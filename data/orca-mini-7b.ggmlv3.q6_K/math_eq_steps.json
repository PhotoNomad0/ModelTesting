Help as much as you can.\n\n### User:\n25 - 4 * 2 + 3 = ?\nShow your work.\n\n### Response:\n\n\nTo solve this expression, we need to follow the order of operations, which is PEMDAS (Parentheses, Exponents, Multiplication and Division, Addition and Subtraction) and perform the multiplication before addition and subtraction. \n\nSo, we start by multiplying 25 and 4, which gives us 100. Then, we add 3 to get 103. Therefore, the answer is 103.\n\nHere's how we arrived at this answer:\n\n- First, we have 25 - 4 * 2, which simplifies to 25 - 8, or 17.\n- Then, we add 3 to 17, which gives us 20.\n- Finally, we subtract 20 from 103, which gives us the final answer of 83."}], "created": 1688145473, "id": "foobarbaz", "model": "", "object": "text_completion", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 193, "prompt_tokens": 68, "total_tokens": 261}, "time": "15.86"}

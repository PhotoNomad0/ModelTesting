First, we need to multiply 4 by 2 which gives us 8. \n2. Then, we divide 8 by 2 which gives us 4. \n3. Next, we subtract 4 from 25 which gives us 21. \n4. Finally, we add 3 to 21 which gives us the final answer of 24. \n\nTherefore, the solution to the expression \"25 - 4 * 2 + 3\" is 24."}], "created": 1692873357, "id": "foobarbaz", "model": "ggml-orca-mini-7b.ggmlv3.q6_K.bin", "object": "text_completion", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 158, "prompt_tokens": 68, "total_tokens": 226}, "time": "88.58"}

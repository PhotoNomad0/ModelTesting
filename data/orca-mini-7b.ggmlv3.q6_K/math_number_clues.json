However, we can eliminate 25 as it is not between 20 and 40, and 49 as it is a square number (9^2) and you have already determined that I am not a prime number. Therefore, the only possible answer is 36 which satisfies all the given criteria."}], "created": 1692841469, "id": "foobarbaz", "model": "ggml-orca-mini-7b.ggmlv3.q6_K.bin", "object": "text_completion", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 89, "prompt_tokens": 85, "total_tokens": 174}, "time": "11.27"}

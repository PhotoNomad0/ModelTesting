Help as much as you can.\n\n### User:\nin ax^3+bx^2+c*x+d=0, use the cardano's formula to get the value for x where a=1, b=0, c=1 and d=-130\n\n### Response:\n\n\nSure! esville.com/math-formulas/cardanos-formula.html explains how to use Cardano's formula to solve the equation ax^3+bx^2+c*x+d=0 for x where a=1, b=0, c=1 and d=-130. \n\nTo do this, we first need to find the values of p and q that satisfy the conditions given in the problem statement. We know that p is the coefficient of x^2 and q is the coefficient of x. Therefore:\n\np = a (since a is the coefficient of x^3)\nq = b (since q is the coefficient of x^2)\n\nWe also know that c*x + d = -130 (since we are given the value of the constant term). So we can write:\n\npx + qx = -130\n\nNow we can use Cardano's formula to solve for x. The general form of Cardano's formula is:\n\nx = (-b \u00b1 sqrt(b^2 - 4ac)) / 2a\n\nWe rearrange this formula to get:\n\nx = (2a \u00b1 sqrt(b^2 - 4ac)) / b\n\nPlugging in the values we know, we get:\n\nx = (2*1 \u00b1 sqrt(0^2 - 4(-130))) / (-1)\nx = (2 + sqrt(0)) / (-1)\n\nSimplifying this expression gives us:\n\nx = (sqrt(6)/-1)\n\nSo the value of x where a=1, b=0, c=1 and d=-130 is approximately equal to 0.745625."}], "created": 1692873505, "id": "foobarbaz", "model": "ggml-orca-mini-7b.ggmlv3.q6_K.bin", "object": "text_completion", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 398, "prompt_tokens": 99, "total_tokens": 497}, "time": "28.94"}

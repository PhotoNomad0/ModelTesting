Divide 1 by x:\n x = 1/130\n\n2. Multiply both sides of the equation by 130:\n 1/130 * 130 = -1\n\n3. Subtract -1 from both sides of the equation:\n -1 - (-1) = 0\n\nTherefore, the value of x that satisfies the equation is 130."}], "created": 1692842241, "id": "foobarbaz", "model": "ggml-orca-mini-7b.ggmlv3.q6_K.bin", "object": "text_completion", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 119, "prompt_tokens": 69, "total_tokens": 188}, "time": "92.34"}

Help as much as you can.\n\n### User:\nin x^3+x-130=0, use the cardano's formula to get the value for x\n\n### Response:\n\n\nTo use Cardano's formula, we first need to find the sign of the leading coefficient (the coefficient of the x^2 term). \n\nThe leading coefficient in the equation x^3 + x - 130 = 0 is positive, since the coefficient of the x^2 term is positive. \n\nUsing Cardano's formula, we have:\n\nx = [-b \u00b1 sqrt(b^2 - 4ac)] / 2a\n\nwhere a=1, b=6, and c=-130.\n\nSubstituting these values into the formula, we get:\n\nx = [-6 \u00b1 sqrt(6^2 - 4(1)(-130))] / 2(1)\n\nSimplifying this expression, we get:\n\nx = [-6 \u00b1 sqrt(1 + 1920)] / 2\n\nx = [-6 \u00b1 sqrt(2056)] / 2\n\nSo the two possible values for x are:\n\nx = -31 or x = -46"}], "created": 1688145539, "id": "foobarbaz", "model": "", "object": "text_completion", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 253, "prompt_tokens": 76, "total_tokens": 329}, "time": "17.82"}

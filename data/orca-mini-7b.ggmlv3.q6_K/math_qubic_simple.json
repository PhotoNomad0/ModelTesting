Help as much as you can.\n\n### User:\nin x^3+x-130=0, use the cardano's formula to get the value for x\n\n### Response:\n\n\nSure! esville's formula is a method for finding the roots of a polynomial equation. The general form of Cardano's formula is:\n\nx = (-b \u00b1 sqrt(b^2 - 4ac)) / 2a\n\nwhere a, b, and c are coefficients in an quadratic equation. In your case, we have x^3 + x - 130 = 0, so we can use Cardano's formula as follows:\n\nx = (-b \u00b1 sqrt(b^2 - 4ac)) / 2a\n\nwhere a = 1, b = -130, and c = 0. Substituting these values into the formula, we get:\n\nx = (-(-130) \u00b1 sqrt((-130)^2 - 4(1)(0))) / 2(1)\n\nSimplifying this expression gives us:\n\nx = (130 \u00b1 sqrt(130^2 - 4)) / 2\n\nSo the two solutions are x = 65 and x = 10."}], "created": 1692873525, "id": "foobarbaz", "model": "ggml-orca-mini-7b.ggmlv3.q6_K.bin", "object": "text_completion", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 251, "prompt_tokens": 76, "total_tokens": 327}, "time": "20.00"}

Help as much as you can.\n\n### User:\nHarmony used discarded paper to make notepads for her friends. She would fold five letter size pieces of paper three times then cut along the lines. She would then stack the smaller note papers and staple them together. How long would one notepad last if someone wrote ten notes per day?\n\n### Response:\n\n\nIf someone writes ten notes per day on a notepad that has been made using discarded paper, the notepad would last for approximately 30 days. \n\nThis is because the paper used to make the notepad was discarded, which means it was already used and recycled. Therefore, the paper is already damaged and may not last as long as new paper. \n\nTo calculate the lifespan of the notepad, we can assume that each note takes up about 1/5th of a sheet of paper. Therefore, if someone writes ten notes per day, they will use about 20 sheets of paper per day (10 notes x 5 sheets per note).\n\nIf we assume that the notepad is made of 10 sheets of paper, then it can last for 30 days since there are 365 days in a year."}], "created": 1688145354, "id": "foobarbaz", "model": "", "object": "text_completion", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 186, "prompt_tokens": 111, "total_tokens": 297}, "time": "15.83"}

Help as much as you can.\n\n### User:\nHarmony used discarded paper to make notepads for her friends. She would fold five letter size pieces of paper three times then cut along the lines. She would then stack the smaller note papers and staple them together. How long would one notepad last if someone wrote ten notes per day?\n\n### Response:\n\n\nIf Harmony used 10 sheets of paper (5 x letter size) to make one notepad, then she could make 20 notepads per sheet. Therefore, each notepad would last for 5 days if someone wrote ten notes per day."}], "created": 1692872858, "id": "foobarbaz", "model": "ggml-orca-mini-7b.ggmlv3.q6_K.bin", "object": "text_completion", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 56, "prompt_tokens": 111, "total_tokens": 167}, "time": "9.58"}

Help as much as you can.\n\n### User:\nBefore Cam broke his right arm, he was able to type 9 words per minute on his phone.  After he broke his arm, he had to use his left hand for a while, and he could only type 6 words per minute. What is the difference between the number of words he could type in 5 minutes before and after he broke his arm\n\n### Response:\n\n\nTo calculate the difference between the number of words Cam could type in 5 minutes before and after he broke his arm, we need to subtract the number of words he could type before from the number of words he could type after. \n\nSo, the difference is:\n\n9 words per minute - 6 words per minute = 3 words per minute\n\nTherefore, Cam could type 3 more words per minute after he broke his arm than he could before."}], "created": 1688145365, "id": "foobarbaz", "model": "", "object": "text_completion", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 98, "prompt_tokens": 123, "total_tokens": 221}, "time": "11.67"}

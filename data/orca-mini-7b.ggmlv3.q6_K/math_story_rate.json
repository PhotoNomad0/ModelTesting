Help as much as you can.\n\n### User:\nBefore Cam broke his right arm, he was able to type 9 words per minute on his phone.  After he broke his arm, he had to use his left hand for a while, and he could only type 6 words per minute. What is the difference between the number of words he could type in 5 minutes before and after he broke his arm\n\n### Response:\n\n\nIf Cam was able to type 9 words per minute on his phone before breaking his right arm, then he would have been able to type 9 x 5 = 45 words in 5 minutes. \n\nIf he had to use his left hand for a while after breaking his arm, and could only type 6 words per minute, then he would have been able to type 6 x 5 = 30 words in 5 minutes. \n\nTherefore, the difference between the number of words he could type in 5 minutes before and after he broke his arm is 45 - 30 = 15 words per minute."}], "created": 1692872873, "id": "foobarbaz", "model": "ggml-orca-mini-7b.ggmlv3.q6_K.bin", "object": "text_completion", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 138, "prompt_tokens": 123, "total_tokens": 261}, "time": "14.41"}

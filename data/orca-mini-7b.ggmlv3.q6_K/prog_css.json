Help as much as you can.\n\n### User:\nHow do you align a row of divs to the right using flex in css?  Show me an example.\n\n### Response:\n\n\nTo align a row of divs to the right using flex in CSS, you can use the `flex-direction` property with the value `row`. Here's an example:\n\n```css\n.container {\n display: flex;\n flex-direction: row; /* Align the rows to the right */\n justify-content: center; /* Center the elements within each row */\n}\n\n.div1, .div2, .div3 {\n width: 50%;\n background-color: #f2f2f2;\n padding: 10px;\n text-align: center;\n margin: 10px;\n border: 1px solid #ddd;\n}\n```\n\nIn this example, the `container` class uses `flex` to align its contents to the right. The `justify-content` property is set to `center` to distribute the elements evenly within each row. Within each div, we use `text-align: center` and `margin` to center the content horizontally. Finally, we add a border with some dashed lines to create some visual separation between the elements."}], "created": 1692843299, "id": "foobarbaz", "model": "ggml-orca-mini-7b.ggmlv3.q6_K.bin", "object": "text_completion", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 250, "prompt_tokens": 74, "total_tokens": 324}, "time": "92.26"}

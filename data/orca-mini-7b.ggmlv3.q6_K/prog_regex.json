Help as much as you can.\n\n### User:\ncreate a regex expression to extract a three character code like \"1Jn\" from a filename in format \"57-1Jn.usfm\".  The characters can be upper or lower case letters or digits. And the filename extension must be \".usfm\".\n\n### Response:\n\n\nHere's the regex expression to extract a three character code like \"1Jn\" from a filename in format \"57-1Jn.usfm\": \n\n```\n\\b[A-Za-z0-9]*\\.[A-Za-z]{2}\\b\n```\n\nExplanation:\n\n- `\\b` matches the word boundary, ensuring that we are matching a complete filename.\n- `[A-Za-z0-9]*` matches zero or more characters that can be letters, digits, or dots.\n- `\\.[A-Za-z]{2}` matches a period followed by two uppercase letters.\n- `\\b` matches another word boundary to ensure that we are matching the three character code. \n\nI hope this helps! Let me know if you have any other questions."}], "created": 1693335199, "id": "foobarbaz", "model": "ggml-orca-mini-7b.ggmlv3.q6_K.bin", "object": "text_completion", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 194, "prompt_tokens": 106, "total_tokens": 300}, "time": "40.64"}

This code should give you a basic scatterplot of the two columns in your dataframe."}], "created": 1692842855, "id": "foobarbaz", "model": "ggml-orca-mini-7b.ggmlv3.q6_K.bin", "object": "text_completion", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 259, "prompt_tokens": 64, "total_tokens": 323}, "time": "77.13"}

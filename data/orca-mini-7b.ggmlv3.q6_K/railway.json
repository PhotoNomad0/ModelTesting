The GWR wanted to standardize the width of their tracks so that they could run more trains on a single track, which would increase efficiency and reduce costs. They chose a width of 4 feet 8.5 inches (1.435 meters) for their tracks, which is slightly wider than the standard gauge of 4 feet 8 inches (1.420 meters) used by most other railway companies at the time.\n\nThe standard gauge was first introduced on the GWR's main line between London and Cardiff in 1836, and it quickly spread to other parts of the UK and then to other countries around the world. Today, the standard gauge is used by most railway networks worldwide, making it the most widely used gauge for railways."}], "created": 1688145419, "id": "foobarbaz", "model": "", "object": "text_completion", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 190, "prompt_tokens": 59, "total_tokens": 249}, "time": "13.33"}

He wanted to create a single track that could accommodate both goods and passenger trains. To achieve this, he decided to use a distance of 4 feet between each pair of tracks, which is equal to half the length of the train wheels. This standard gauge was chosen because it allowed for efficient use of the available land and reduced the cost of building new railway lines. The standard gauge became widely adopted in other countries as well, including the United States, France, Germany, and Australia. Today, most modern railways around the world use the standard gauge of 4 feet between each pair of tracks."}], "created": 1692872943, "id": "foobarbaz", "model": "ggml-orca-mini-7b.ggmlv3.q6_K.bin", "object": "text_completion", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 150, "prompt_tokens": 59, "total_tokens": 209}, "time": "42.62"}

How many sisters does Sally have?\n\n### Response:\n\n\nLet's break down the information given in the problem. \n\n- Sally has 3 brothers. \n- Her brothers have 2 sisters. \n\nFrom this information, we can set up a system of equations to solve for the number of sisters Sally has. \n\nLet x be the number of sisters Sally has. \n\nSince each brother has 2 sisters, we know that:\n\n3 brothers - 2 sisters per brother = x sisters \n\nSimplifying this equation, we get:\n\nx = 3 + 2x \n\nNow we have two equations with two variables: \n\n3 + 2x = 2x \n\nSimplifying this equation, we get:\n\nx = 2 \n\nSo Sally has 2 sisters."}], "created": 1688145496, "id": "foobarbaz", "model": "", "object": "text_completion", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 172, "prompt_tokens": 71, "total_tokens": 243}, "time": "15.24"}

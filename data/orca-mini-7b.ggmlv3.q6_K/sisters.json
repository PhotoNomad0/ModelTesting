Help as much as you can.\n\n### User:\nSally has 3 brothers. Her brothers have 2 sisters. How many sisters does Sally have?\n\n### Response:\n\n\nLet's assume that the number of sisters that Sally's brothers have is x. According to the problem, Sally herself has 3 brothers who have 2 sisters each, which means that there are a total of 6 siblings (3+2+1). Since Sally has 3 brothers and they have 2 sisters each, we can write an equation:\n\nx + 3 = 6\n\nSimplifying the equation, we get:\n\n5 = x + 3\n\nSubtracting 3 from both sides, we get:\n\nx = 2\n\nTherefore, Sally has 2 sisters."}], "created": 1692873476, "id": "foobarbaz", "model": "ggml-orca-mini-7b.ggmlv3.q6_K.bin", "object": "text_completion", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 134, "prompt_tokens": 71, "total_tokens": 205}, "time": "24.52"}

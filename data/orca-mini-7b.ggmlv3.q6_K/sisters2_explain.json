Help as much as you can.\n\n### User:\nSally is a girl with 3 brothers. Her brothers have 2 sisters. How many sisters does Sally have? Explain your answer\n\n### Response:\n\n\nLet's assume that the number of sisters that Sally has is x. According to the problem, her three brothers have two sisters each, which means they have a total of two sisters. Therefore, Sally's brothers can be represented as 2x + 2, where 2x represents the number of sisters that Sally herself has.\n\nNow we need to find out how many sisters Sally has. We know that her three brothers have a total of two sisters, so we can write:\n\n3x + 2 = 2x + 2\n\nSimplifying this equation, we get:\n\n6x = 4x + 2\n\nDividing both sides by 4, we get:\n\nx = 1.5\n\nTherefore, Sally has 1.5 sisters."}], "created": 1692842148, "id": "foobarbaz", "model": "ggml-orca-mini-7b.ggmlv3.q6_K.bin", "object": "text_completion", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 172, "prompt_tokens": 78, "total_tokens": 250}, "time": "88.17"}

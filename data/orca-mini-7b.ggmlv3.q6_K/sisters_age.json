Calculate this step by step.\n\n### Response:\n\n\nOkay, let's do it step by step:\n\nWhen you were 6 years old, your sister would have been half of your age which means she would be 3/2 = 1.5 times your age.\n\nNow, as an adult, you are 80 years old. Your sister would be the same age as you in terms of birthdays. So if your birthday is represented by \"x\", then your sister's birthday would be represented by \"x+1\".\n\nTherefore, your sister's current age can be calculated as follows:\n\n(80 - 6) + (1/2 * 3/2) = 9.5\n\nSo your sister is currently around 9 years old."}], "created": 1692872824, "id": "foobarbaz", "model": "ggml-orca-mini-7b.ggmlv3.q6_K.bin", "object": "text_completion", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 159, "prompt_tokens": 84, "total_tokens": 243}, "time": "15.06"}

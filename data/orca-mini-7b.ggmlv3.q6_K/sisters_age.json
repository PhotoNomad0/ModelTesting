Help as much as you can.\n\n### User:\nwhen I was 6, my sister was half my age. Now I am 80. How old is my sister now? Calculate this step by step.\n\n### Response:\n\n\nTo calculate your sister's current age, we need to subtract the difference between her age and your age at the time you were 6 years old from the number of years that have passed since then. \n\nLet's assume that your sister was half your age when you were 6 years old, which means she would be 3/4 of your age. \n\nIf you are now 80 years old, then the number of years that have passed since you were 6 years old is:\n\n80 - 6 = 74\n\nTo find your sister's current age, we can use the formula:\n\nAge = (Years - 1) x 4 + Age at 6\n\nSubstituting the values we have:\n\nAge = (74 - 1) x 4 + 3/4\n\nSimplifying:\n\nAge = 73 x 4 + 3/4\n\nAge = 29 + 3/4\n\nAge = 29.44 (rounded to two decimal places)\n\nTherefore, your sister is approximately 29 years old."}], "created": 1688145322, "id": "foobarbaz", "model": "", "object": "text_completion", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 256, "prompt_tokens": 84, "total_tokens": 340}, "time": "18.40"}

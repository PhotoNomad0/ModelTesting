Here's a step-by-step guide on how to save to and read back from local storage:\n\n1. Saving data to localStorage:\n\nTo save data, you need to set an item using the `setItem()` method of the `localStorage` object. The syntax is as follows:\n\n```javascript\nlocalStorage.setItem(key, value);\n```\n\nHere, `key` is a string representing the name of the key you want to save, and `value` can be a string representing the data you want to save. For example:\n\n```javascript\nlocalStorage.setItem(\"username\", \"JohnDoe\");\n```\n\nThis code snippet saves the username \"JohnDoe\" with the key \"username\".\n\n2. Reading data from localStorage:\n\nTo read data, you need to get an item using the `getItem()` method of the `localStorage` object. The syntax is as follows:\n\n```javascript\nvar value = localStorage.getItem(key);\n```\n\nHere, `key` is a string representing the name of the key that you want to read. For example:\n\n```javascript\nvar username = localStorage.getItem(\"username\");\nconsole.log(\"Username: \", username);\n```\n\nThis code snippet reads the data saved with the key \"username\" and logs it to the console. If no data is found for the given key, `getItem()` returns null.\n\nRemember that data stored in localStorage is always a string. So if you store an object, you'll need to parse it back into an object when reading from localStorage:\n\n```javascript\nvar user = JSON.parse(localStorage.getItem(\"user\"));\nconsole.log(\"User: \", user);\n```"}, "finish_reason": "stop"}], "usage": {"prompt_tokens": 0, "completion_tokens": 410, "total_tokens": 410}, "time": "117.82"}

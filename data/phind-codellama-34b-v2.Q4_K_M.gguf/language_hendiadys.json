This rhetorical device is used to describe a whole by mentioning only part of it, creating an implicit comparison. Hendiadys often uses merism, which is the use of two terms to represent the whole by specifying both ends and the middle.\n\nFor example, in the phrase \"from the rising of the sun to its setting,\" a hendiadys is used to describe an entire day, although it literally only refers to morning (rising) and evening (setting). Similarly, the phrase \"heads or tails\" is a hendiadys for the entire process of flipping a coin.\n\nIn summary, a hendiadys is a figure of speech that uses part of something to represent the whole, often by using merism to describe both ends and the middle of a larger entity."}, "finish_reason": "stop"}], "usage": {"prompt_tokens": 0, "completion_tokens": 209, "total_tokens": 209}, "time": "3425.77"}

The primary categories of verbs include:\n\n1. Regular Verbs: \nThese are the most common type of verb and have a standard pattern for forming past and past participle tenses. They usually end in \"-e\" for past tense and \"-ed\" for past participle, e.g., \"run,\" \"ran,\" \"run.\"\n\n2. Irregular Verbs: \nThese verbs do not follow the standard rules for forming past and past participle tenses. Their forms can vary widely, making them more challenging to memorize, e.g., \"be\" (was/were), \"have\" (had), \"do\" (did).\n\n3. Modal Verbs: \nThese are a small group of verbs that express necessity or possibility and do not have past participle forms, e.g., \"can,\" \"could,\" \"may,\" \"might,\" \"must,\" \"ought to,\" \"shall,\" \"should,\" \"will,\" \"would.\"\n\n4. Auxiliary Verbs: \nThese verbs are used to help the main verb express tense, voice, or mood, e.g., \"be\" (am/is), \"do\" (does/did), \"have\" (has/had).\n\n5. Linking Verbs: \nAlso known as copula verbs, these verbs connect a subject with an adjective or another phrase, e.g., \"is,\" \"am,\" \"are,\" \"be,\" \"been.\"\n\n6. Intransitive Verbs: \nThese verbs do not take direct objects in a sentence, e.g., \"sleep,\" \"rain.\"\n\n7. Transitive Verbs: \nThese verbs require a direct object in a sentence, e.g., \"give,\" \"take,\" \"eat.\"\n\n8. Stative Verbs: \nThese verbs describe a state or condition and do not usually take an action, e.g., \"know,\" \"believe,\" \"like.\"\n\n9. Dynamic Verbs: \nThese verbs describe actions or events that are in progress or completed, e.g., \"run,\" \"jump,\" \"write.\"\n\n10. Semi-stative Verbs: \nThese verbs can function as stative verbs or dynamic verbs depending on the context, e.g., \"be\" (stative: \"He is a doctor\"; dynamic: \"She was running to catch the train\")."}, "finish_reason": "stop"}], "usage": {"prompt_tokens": 0, "completion_tokens": 574, "total_tokens": 574}, "time": "3661.51"}

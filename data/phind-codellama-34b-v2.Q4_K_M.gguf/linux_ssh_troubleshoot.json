The error message \"Permission denied (publickey)\" indicates that there might be an issue with the provided public key or its permissions. Here are some possible reasons for this error:\n\n1. Incorrect Public Key Path: Make sure the path of your private key file is correct. In your command, it seems like you're using \"~/UserKey.pem\". If the file does not exist in your home directory, you should provide the absolute path of the file. For example: \"/home/user/UserKey.pem\" or \"/Users/username/UserKey.pem\" (depending on your OS).\n\n2. Incorrect Public Key for the User: Ensure that the public key corresponding to \"UserKey.pem\" has been added to the authorized_keys file on the remote server (in this case, ec2-34-221-131-108.us-west-2.compute.amazonaws.com). This error might occur if there is a mismatch between the private and public keys, or if the correct public key has not been added to the remote server's authorized_keys file.\n\n3. Permission Issues with Private Key File: Check the permissions of your private key file (\"UserKey.pem\"). It should only be readable by the owner (that is, you). To set the appropriate permissions, you can use the command \"chmod 600 ~/UserKey.pem\" or \"chmod 600 /path/to/your/key\".\n\n4. Wrong Username: Ensure that you're using the correct username to connect to the remote server. If you don't specify a username, it will use your local system's username by default. But in case of AWS EC2 instances, you need to use the correct AWS username (like \"ec2-user\", \"ubuntu\", etc.). So the command should look like this:\n\n```ssh -i \"~/UserKey.pem\" -C -L 25900:localhost:5900 ec2-user@ec2-34-221-131-108.us-west-2.compute.amazonaws.com```\n\nMake sure to verify and correct any of the above mentioned points that might be causing the \"Permission denied (publickey)\" error, and then try running your command again."}, "finish_reason": "stop"}], "usage": {"prompt_tokens": 0, "completion_tokens": 572, "total_tokens": 572}, "time": "2828.88"}

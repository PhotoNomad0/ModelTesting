First, notice that both sides of the equation are positive. So, we know that X cannot be negative. Let's denote the left side of the equation with y: y = 8^X + 2^X.\n\n2. Now let's try to estimate the value of X. Since the base of the exponential function is greater than 1 (both 8 and 2 are greater than 1), as we increase X, the value of the function will also increase. Initially, let's set y = 130 and solve for X:\n\n   y = 8^X + 2^X\n   130 = 8^X + 2^X\n\n3. We can see that when X = 4, y = 8^4 + 2^4 = 6562, which is greater than 130. Therefore, X must be less than 4. Let's try a smaller value for X, such as X = 2:\n\n   y = 8^2 + 2^2 = 68\n\n4. We can see that y = 68 is still greater than 130 when X = 2. Therefore, we need to find an X value between 2 and 4.\n\n5. Let's use a method of approximation, such as the bisection method, to estimate the value of X:\n\n   - We know that for X = 2, y = 68;\n   - For X = 4, y = 6562;\n   - Since the function is increasing, there must be a root (a solution to the equation) between these two values.\n\n6. Using the bisection method, we can estimate X:\n\n   - Calculate the midpoint between 2 and 4: X_mid = (2 + 4)/2 = 3;\n   - If y = 8^X_mid + 2^X_mid is greater than 130, then update the higher limit to X_mid. Otherwise, update the lower limit to X_mid.\n\n7. Repeat step 6 until we get a sufficiently accurate estimate for X. In this case, after just two iterations, we find that X_mid = 3 is a good approximation:\n\n   8^3 + 2^3 = 514\n\n8. Since the left side of the equation (y) is slightly less than 130, we can conclude that X \u2248 3. So, the solution to the equation 8^X + 2^X = 130 is approximately equal to 3."}, "finish_reason": "stop"}], "usage": {"prompt_tokens": 0, "completion_tokens": 613, "total_tokens": 613}, "time": "183.40"}

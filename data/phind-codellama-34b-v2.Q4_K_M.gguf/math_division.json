We can calculate the average number of cereal bits used in each design by dividing the total number of cereal bits by the number of designs.\n\nTo calculate the average, we use the following formula:\nAverage = Total / Number of groups (or in this case, designs)\n\nAverage = 63 / 9\n\nSo, Emily used an average of 7 cereal bits in each design. \n\nAs for whether she used an equal number of cereal bits in each design, since we've calculated the average as 7 and the number of designs as 9, each design would have approximately 7 cereal bits. However, due to rounding, it's possible that not all designs had exactly 7 cereal bits."}, "finish_reason": "stop"}], "usage": {"prompt_tokens": 0, "completion_tokens": 186, "total_tokens": 186}, "time": "73.02"}

It was developed by Jerome Cardano in 1545. The formula can be quite complex and may not always guarantee real roots for all values of the coefficients. For the given cubic equation ax^3+bx^2+cx+d = 0, with a=1, b=0, c=1 and d=-130, we can apply Cardano's formula as follows:\n\nLet p = -(3ac - b^2)/(3a^2), q = (2b^3 - 9abc + 27a^2d)/(27a^3) and x = u + v. Then, the roots of the equation can be found using:\n\nu = [1/3] * sqrt(-(q/2) + sqrt((q/2)^2 - (p/3)^3))\nv = [1/3] * sqrt(-(q/2) - sqrt((q/2)^2 - (p/3)^3))\n\nx1 = u+v\nx2 = -(u+v)/2 + i*sqrt(3)(u-v)/2*sqrt(-1)\nx3 = -(u+v)/2 - i*sqrt(3)(u-v)/2*sqrt(-1)\n\nNow, we can substitute the values of a, b, c and d into these formulas:\n\np = -(3*(1)*(1)*(1) - 0^2)/(3*(1)^2) = -1/3\nq = (2*(0)^3 - 9*(1)*(1)*(1) + 27*(1)^2*(-130))/(27*(1)^3) = 130/27\n\nSo, u = [1/3] * sqrt((-130/27)/2 - sqrt(((-130/27)/2)^2 - ((-1/3)^3)))\nv = [1/3] * sqrt((-130/27)/2 + sqrt(((-130/27)/2)^2 - ((-1/3)^3)))\n\nx1 = u+v\nx2 = -(u+v)/2 + i*sqrt(3)(u-v)/2*sqrt(-1)\nx3 = -(u+v)/2 - i*sqrt(3)(u-v)/2*sqrt(-1)\n\nHowever, it's important to note that Cardano's formula might not always provide real solutions for all cubic equations. In this particular case, the discriminant (Delta) is negative, which implies that the roots of the equation are complex and not real. Therefore, we can't find a real root x for the given equation using Cardano's formula."}, "finish_reason": "stop"}], "usage": {"prompt_tokens": 0, "completion_tokens": 635, "total_tokens": 635}, "time": "190.59"}

The Newton-Raphson method is a root finding algorithm that produces successively better approximations of the roots (or zeroes) of a real-valued function.\n\nThe updating formula for the Newton-Raphson method is x_next = x - f(x)/f'(x), where x_next is the next approximation, x is the current approximation, f(x) is the function itself, and f'(x) is the derivative of f(x).\n\nFirst, we need to find the derivative of the function, which is f'(x) = 3x^2 + 1. Then, we can apply the Newton-Raphson method.\n\nLet's start with an initial guess of x = 0:\n\n1. Plug x = 0 into the equation and f'(x): f(0) = -130, f'(0) = 1.\n2. Calculate the next approximation: x_next = 0 - (-130)/1 = 130.\n3. Repeat steps 1 and 2 with the new value of x until the approximations become close enough to the actual root.\n\nHere are some iterations:\n\n- f(0) = -130, f'(0) = 1, x_next = 0 - (-130)/1 = 130\n- f(130) = -48952130, f'(130) = 16930, x_next = 130 - (-48952130)/16930 \u2248 130.00027\n- f(130.00027) = -4.8952130 x 10^-8, f'(130.00027) = 4.786189 x 10^5, x_next = 130.00027 + (-4.8952130 x 10^-8)/(4.786189 x 10^5) \u2248 130.00027\n\nThe value of x is approximately 130.00027."}, "finish_reason": "stop"}], "usage": {"prompt_tokens": 0, "completion_tokens": 545, "total_tokens": 545}, "time": "147.61"}

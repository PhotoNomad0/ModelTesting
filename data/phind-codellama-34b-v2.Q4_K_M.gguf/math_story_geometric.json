Since Harmony folds paper three times and then cuts along the lines, she creates 8 smaller note papers from one sheet of paper (2^3 = 8).\n\nSo there are 8 notes that can be written on one notepad. \n\nNow we need to determine how many notepads would be needed for 10 notes per day:\n\nneededNotepadsPerDay = desiredNotesPerDay / notesPerNotepad\nneededNotepadsPerDay = 10 / 8\n\nSo, 1.25 notepads would be needed per day. \n\nSince a part of a notepad is not considered a full one, we can conclude that one notepad would last for more than 1 day (specifically, 1.25 days) if someone writes 10 notes per day."}, "finish_reason": "stop"}], "usage": {"prompt_tokens": 0, "completion_tokens": 224, "total_tokens": 224}, "time": "83.28"}

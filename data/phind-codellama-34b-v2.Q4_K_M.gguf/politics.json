It's essential to evaluate each political group based on their policies, values, and actions independently.

Instead, we should focus on understanding the differences among these groups and forming our own informed opinions about which policies best align with our values and priorities."}, "finish_reason": "stop"}], "usage": {"prompt_tokens": 0, "completion_tokens": 106, "total_tokens": 106}, "time": "34.33"}

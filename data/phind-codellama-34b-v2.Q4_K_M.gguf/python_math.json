Here's an example code snippet:\n\n```python\nimport numpy as np\nfrom scipy.optimize import fsolve\n\ndef cubic_equation(coefficients):\n    a, b, c, d = coefficients\n    def fun(x):\n        return a * x**3 + b * x**2 + c * x + d\n    return fun\n\n# Define the coefficients of the equation\na = 1\nb = -6\nc = 11\nd = -6\n\n# Create the function with those coefficients\nfun = cubic_equation([a, b, c, d])\n\n# Use fsolve to find the roots of the function\nroots = fsolve(fun, (1,))\nprint(\"The solutions are: {}\".format(roots))\n```\n\nThis code defines a function `cubic_equation` that takes in a list of coefficients and returns another function representing the cubic equation. The `fsolve` function from scipy is then used to find the roots of this function. Note that `fsolve` may not always find all roots, especially if there are complex roots or multiple roots that overlap in magnitude. In such cases, a different root-finding method may be necessary.\n\nAlso keep in mind that this code assumes that the cubic equation has at least one real root. If the coefficients lead to an equation with no real roots (i.e., it's purely complex), or if the leading coefficient is zero making it a quadratic or lower degree equation, you would need to modify this code accordingly."}, "finish_reason": "stop"}], "usage": {"prompt_tokens": 0, "completion_tokens": 398, "total_tokens": 398}, "time": "128.07"}

Here's a simple example of how you can create a function to read data from an Excel file:\n\nFirst, make sure to install pandas and openpyxl (which is a dependency for reading/writing Excel files) using pip:\n\n```bash\npip install pandas openpyxl\n```\n\nNow, you can use the following Python code to read data from an Excel spreadsheet:\n\n```python\nimport pandas as pd\n\ndef read_spreadsheet(file_path):\n    # Read the spreadsheet\n    df = pd.read_excel(file_path, engine='openpyxl')\n    \n    # Return the DataFrame\n    return df\n```\n\nThis function takes a file path as an argument and reads data from the Excel file using `pd.read_excel()`. The resulting data is stored in a pandas DataFrame, which is then returned by the function.\n\nTo use this function, simply provide the file path of your Excel file:\n\n```python\n# Replace 'your_file_path.xlsx' with the actual file path\ndata = read_spreadsheet('your_file_path.xlsx')\nprint(data)\n```\n\nThis will print the data from your Excel spreadsheet. If you want to work with other formats of spreadsheets (like .csv or Google Sheets), pandas provides `read_csv()` and `read_gbq()` functions respectively, which can be used in a similar way as `read_excel()`."}, "finish_reason": "stop"}], "usage": {"prompt_tokens": 0, "completion_tokens": 336, "total_tokens": 336}, "time": "91.25"}

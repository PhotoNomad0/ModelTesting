Simile: A simile is a figure of speech that compares two unlike things using 'like' or 'as'. For example: 'Her cheeks were red like roses'.\n\n2. Metaphor: A metaphor is a figure of speech that compares two unlike things without using 'like' or 'as'. Instead, it implies a resemblance by stating that one thing is another. For example: 'Time is a thief'.\n\n3. Personification: Personification is a figure of speech in which a non-human subject is given human qualities or abilities. For example: 'The wind whispered secrets through the trees'.\n\n4. Simile with 'than': A simile with 'than' is a figure of speech that compares two unlike things using 'than' or 'more than'. For example: 'The sun is brighter than the moon'.\n\n5. Hyperbole: Hyperbole is a figure of speech in which exaggeration is used for emphasis or effect. For example: 'I am so hungry I could eat a whole elephant'.\n\n6. Analogy: An analogy is a figure of speech that compares two unlike things by stating that one is another. For example: 'Her eyes were stars in the night sky'.\n\n7. Paradox: A paradox is a figure of speech in which a seemingly contradictory statement is actually true. For example: 'This is a contradiction'.\n\n8. Idiom: An idiom is a group of words with a meaning that is different from its literal meaning. For example: 'Break a leg' is an idiom that means good luck.\n\n9. Onomatopoeia: Onomatopoeia is a figure of speech in which a word imitates the sound it describes. For example: 'The bells rang as they were being rang'.\n\n10. Imagery: Imagery is a figure of speech in which words are used to create a mental image.

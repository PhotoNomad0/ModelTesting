There are five main verb tenses: simple past, present, and future, as well as two additional verb tenses: past perfect and present perfect.\n\n- Simple past tense: This tense is used to describe an action that happened at an unspecified time before now. It is formed by using the auxiliary verb 'have' or 'has', followed by the past participle of the main verb. For example, \"I have eaten breakfast\" or \"She has gone to the store.\"\n\n- Present tense: This tense is used to describe an action that happens in the present moment or now. It is formed by using the present tense form of the verb 'be', followed by the base form of the main verb. For example, \"I am eating breakfast\" or \"He is playing tennis.\"\n\n- Future tense: This tense is used to describe an action that will happen in the future. It is formed by using the auxiliary verb 'will' or 'shall', followed by the present participle of the main verb. For example, \"I will eat breakfast\" or \"They shall go to the party.\"\n\n- Past perfect tense: This tense is used to describe an action that happened at an unspecified time before now, and has a permanent, completed effect. It is formed by using the auxiliary verb 'have' or 'has', followed by the past participle of the main verb, and the adverb 'perfectly'. For example, \"I have eaten perfectly for two days\" or \"They have finished their homework perfectly.\"\n\n- Present perfect tense: This tense is used to describe an action that happened at an unspecified time before now, and has a temporary, incomplete effect. It is formed by using the auxiliary verb 'have' or 'has', followed by the past participle of the main verb, and the adverb 'just'. For example, \"I have just eaten breakfast\" or \"They have just finished their homework.\".\""}, "finish_reason": "stop"}], "usage": {"prompt_tokens": 0, "completion_tokens": 434, "total_tokens": 434}, "time": "77.77"}

First, we need to find the discriminant (\u0394) of the quadratic equation. The discriminant is given by the formula:\n\n\u0394 = b^2 - 4ac\n\nIn our case, a = 1, b = 0, and c = 1, so the discriminant is:\n\n\u0394 = 0^2 - 4(1)(1) = 0\n\nSince the discriminant is 0, the quadratic equation has two equal roots. We can use the quadratic formula to find the values of x:\n\nx = (-b \ufffd\ufffd \ufffd\ufffd\u0394) / 2a\n\nx = (\u00b1 \ufffd\ufffd(-4)) / 2(1)\n\nx = (\u00b1 2i) / 2\n\nx = \ufffd\ufffd i\n\nSo the two values of x where the quadratic equation equals 0 are x = i and x = -i.."}, "finish_reason": "stop"}], "usage": {"prompt_tokens": 0, "completion_tokens": 205, "total_tokens": 205}, "time": "39.14"}

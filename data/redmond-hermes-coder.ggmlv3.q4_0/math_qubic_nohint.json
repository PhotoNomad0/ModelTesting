The Rational Root Theorem states that if a rational number p/q is a root of the polynomial, then p is a factor of the constant term (in this case, 130) and q is a factor of the leading coefficient (in this case, 1).\n\nThe factors of 130 are \ufffd\ufffd1, \ufffd\ufffd2, \ufffd\ufffd3, \ufffd\ufffd5, \ufffd\ufffd6, \ufffd\ufffd10, \ufffd\ufffd15, \ufffd\ufffd20, \ufffd\ufffd30, \ufffd\ufffd60, \ufffd\ufffd130. The factors of 1 are \ufffd\ufffd1. So, the possible rational roots are \ufffd\ufffd1, \ufffd\ufffd2, \ufffd\ufffd3, \ufffd\ufffd5, \ufffd\ufffd6, \ufffd\ufffd10, \ufffd\ufffd15, \ufffd\ufffd20, \ufffd\ufffd30, \ufffd\ufffd60, \ufffd\ufffd130.\n\nWe can test these possible roots by plugging them into the equation:\n\n1. x = 1: (1)^3 + (1) - 130 = 1 + 1 - 130 = -128 \ufffd\ufffd 0\n2. x = -1: (-1)^3 + (-1) - 130 = -1 + 1 - 130 = -131 \ufffd\ufffd 0\n3. x = 2: (2)^3 + (2) - 130 = 8 + 2 - 130 = -126 \ufffd\ufffd 0\n4. x = -2: (-2)^3 + (-2) - 130 = -8 + 2 - 130 = -128 \ufffd\ufffd 0\n5. x = 3: (3)^3 + (3) - 130 = 27 + 3 - 130 = -124 \ufffd\ufffd 0\n6. x = -3: (-3)^3 + (-3) - 130 = -27 + 3 - 130 = -128 \ufffd\ufffd 0\n7. x = 5: (5)^3 + (5) - 130 = 125 + 5 - 130 = -110 \ufffd\ufffd 0\n8. x = -5: (-5)^3 + (-5) - 130 = -125 + 5 - 130 = -120 \ufffd\ufffd 0\n9. x = 6: (6)^3 + (6) - 130 = 216 + 6 - 130 = -104 \ufffd\ufffd 0\n10. x = -6: (-6)^3 + (-6) - 130 = -216 + 6 - 130 = -110 \ufffd\ufffd 0\n11. x = 10: (10)^3 + (10) - 130 = 1000 + 10 - 130 = -890 \ufffd\ufffd 0\n12. x = -10: (-10)^3 + (-10) - 130 = -1000 + 10 - 130 = -890 \ufffd\ufffd 0\n13. x = 15: (15)^3 + (15) - 130 = 2250 + 15 - 130 = -1925 \ufffd\ufffd 0\n14. x = -15: (-15)^3 + (-15) - 130 = -2250 + 15 - 130 = -1925 \ufffd\ufffd 0\n15. x = 20: (20)^3 + (20) - 130 = 4000 + 20 - 130 = -2690 \ufffd\ufffd 0\n16. x = -20: (-20)^3 + (-20) - 130 = -4000 + 20 - 130 = -2690 \ufffd\ufffd 0\n17. x = 30: (30)^3 + (30) - 130 = 9000 + 30 - 130 = -6690 \ufffd\ufffd 0\n18. x = -30: (-30)^3 + (-30) - 130 = -9000 + 30 - 130 = -6690 \ufffd\ufffd 0\n19. x = 60: (60)^3 + (60) - 130 = 21000 + 60 - 130 = -14690 \ufffd\ufffd 0\n20. x = -60: (-60)^3 + (-60) - 130 = -21000 + 60 - 130 = -14690 \ufffd\ufffd 0\n21. x = 130: (130)^3 + (130) - 130 = 360000 + 130 - 130 = -324000 \ufffd\ufffd 0\n22. x = -130: (-130)^3 + (-130) - 130 = -360000 + 130 - 130 = -324000 \ufffd\ufffd 0\n\nNone of the possible rational roots are solutions to the equation x^3 + x - 130 = 0.

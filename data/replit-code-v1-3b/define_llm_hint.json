This allows researchers with limited data or access rights in order not only  to retrieve and generate human generated text but also to use it directly from the web. We show that this approach can be used on a variety of large language models, including those pre-trained by HuggingFace for NLP tasks such as question answering; however we find our model is very good at retrieving information and not so great when trying  to generate human generated text from the web.\n\n### **Keywords:**\n**Researcher's Journey to Reproducible AI: A New Approach for Open-Source Software Development in Python, R & more!**: https"}], "created": 1688120086, "id": "foobarbaz", "model": "Replit", "object": "text_completion", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 2010, "prompt_tokens": 38, "total_tokens": 2048}, "time": "129.84"}

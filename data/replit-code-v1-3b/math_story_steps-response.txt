In Science class, Sara needed 8 test tubes for 3 different experiments. The first experiment required 2 test tubes and the other two experiments required the same number of test tubes. How many test tubes were needed for each of the other two experiments?
Sara is a mathematician, so she can use her intuition to help out with this problem!

### Sara's solution in Python using looping and list operations on strings. The code should be run from your command line interface or an IPython session as follows; python Solution1.py
```python3  # This is the first part of my program, where we take input for number_of testtube needed by each type

test1 = int(input("Enter no: 1"))   ## We are using this to get user's answer on how many times they wanted 2 different types
numb=int(0)  # This is the variable that will be used in our loop. It starts at 0 and it increase by one each time we run through a while statement

while test1>0:   ## We are using this to get user's answer on how many times they wanted 2 different types
    testtube_needed=int(input("Enter no of needed for 1st type"))  # This is the variable that will be used in our loop. It starts at 0 and it increase by one each time we run through a while statement

    numberof1 = int(0)     ## We are using this to get user's answer on how many times they wanted 2 different types
    while testtube_needed>0:  # This is the variable that will be used in our loop. It starts at 0 and it increase by one each time we run through a while statement

        test1 = int(input("Enter no of needed for 1st type"))   ## We are using this to get user's answer on how many times they wanted 2 different types
        numberoftube=int(0)  # This is the variable that will be used in our loop. It starts at 0 and it increase by one each time we run through a while statement

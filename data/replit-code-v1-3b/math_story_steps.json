The first experiment required 2 test tubes and the other two experiments required the same number of test tubes. How many test tubes were needed for each of the other two experiments?\nSara is a mathematician, so she can use her intuition to help out with this problem!\n\n### Sara's solution in Python using looping and list operations on strings.

How do you use them both to create functions that perform similar tasks, but have different names or signature. In other words: how can I make two separately named \"functions\" with very distinct functionality without having a name-clashing problem when calling those newer versions from my old code bases where they're used?\n```python\n\ndef function_name(parameters):  # this is the definition of our first version, it has no implementation yet.    return value;   print(\"This will eventually be implemented by someone else\")     if parameters == []:        raise ValueError('Please provide a list to calculate average from')       else         sum = 0       for i in range(0, len())]          # this is the actual function that does all of our work.    return sum/len();   print(\"The mean value was\",getAverage)     if numbers == [] :        raise ValueError('Please provide a list to calculate average from')       else         sum = 0       for i in range(0, len())]          # this is the actual function that does all of our work.    return sum/len();   print(\"The mean value was\",getAverage)\n```\n\n### What's an advantage or dis-benefit to using a `def` over just writing out your code as you go? How would I use one vs another in my own program, and why is that useful for me at all. In other words: how can we make our functions more reusable by making them into separately named \"functions\" with very distinct functionality without having a name-clashing problem when calling those newer versions from where they're used?\n```python\n\ndef function_name(parameters):  # this is the definition of my first version, it has no implementation yet.    return value;   print(\"This will be implemented by someone else\")     if parameters == []:        raise ValueError('Please provide a list to calculate average from')       else         sum = 0       for i in range(0, len())]          # this is the actual function that does all of our work, but it's not very useful yet.    return sum/len();   print(\"The mean value was\",getAverage)     if numbers == [] :        raise ValueError('Please provide a list to calculate average from')       else         sum = 0       for i in range(0, len())]          # this is the actual function that does all of our work, but it's not very useful yet.    return sum/len();   print(\"The mean value was\",getAverage)\n```\n\n### What are some common mistake you make when writing code? How can I avoid them in my own program and why do they exist at the time that we wrote our first version of a function, or how would one fix it so as to not cause any problems later on. In other words: what is an example for me where having written out all these common mistakes before was useful?\n```python\n\ndef get_average(numbers):  # this code will be used by someone else in their own program, and I'm sure they haven\u2019t read it yet!    return sum([float()for i = range(0, len())])/len();   print(\"The average is\",getAverage)     if numbers == [] :        raise ValueError('Please provide a list to calculate mean from')       else         sum=0       for number in [numbers]:          # this code will be used by someone else, but I'm sure they haven\u2019t read it yet!    return sum/len();   print(\"The average was\",getAverage)     if numbers == [] :        raise ValueError('Please provide a list to calculate mean from')       else         sum=0       for number in [numbers]:          # this code will be used by someone else, but I'm sure they haven\u2019t read it yet!    return sum/len();   print(\"The average was\",getAverage)\n```\n\n### What is the difference between `def` and a class? How do you use them both to create classes that perform similar tasks. In other words: how can I make two separately named \"classes\" with very distinct functionality without having name-clashing problems when calling those newer versions from my old code bases where they're used, or even better yet what are some of the benefits and disadvantage to using a class over just writing out your classes as you go?\n```python\n\nclass function_name(parameters):  # this is our first version.    return value;   print(\"This will eventually be implemented by someone else\")     if parameters == []:        raise ValueError('Please provide an integer list to calculate average from')       else         sum = 0       for i in range(0, len())]          def get_average(self):              # this is our first version.    return sum/len();   print(\"The mean value was\",getAverage)     if numbers == [] :        raise ValueError('Please provide an integer list to calculate average from')       else         sum = 0       for i in range(0, len())]          def get_average(self):              # this is our first version.    return sum/len();   print(\"The mean value was\",getAverage)     if numbers == [] :        raise ValueError('Please provide an integer list to calculate average from')       else         sum = 0       for i in range(0, len())]          def get_average(self):              # this is our first version.    return sum/len();   print(\"The mean value was\",getAverage)     if numbers == [] :        raise ValueError('Please provide an integer list to calculate average from')       else         sum = 0       for i in range(0, len())]          def get_average(self):              # this is our first version.    return sum/len();   print(\"The mean value was\",getAverage)     if numbers == [] :        raise ValueError('Please provide an integer list to calculate average from')       else         sum = 0       for i in range(0, len())]          def get_average(self):              # this is our first version.    return sum/len();   print(\"The mean value was\",getAverage)     if numbers == [] :        raise ValueError('Please provide an integer list to calculate average from')       else         sum = 0       for i in range(0, len())]          def get_average(self):              # this is our first version.    return sum/len();   print(\"The mean value was\",getAverage)     if numbers == [] :        raise ValueError('Please provide an integer list to calculate average from')       else         sum = 0       for i in range(0, len())]          def get_average(self):              # this is our first version.    return sum/len();   print(\"The mean value was\",getAverage)     if numbers == [] :        raise ValueError('Please provide an integer list to calculate average from')       else         sum = 0       for i in range(0, len())]          def get_average(self):              # this is our first version.    return sum/len();   print(\"The mean value was\",getAverage)     if numbers == [] :        raise ValueError('Please provide an integer list to calculate average from')       else         sum = 0       for i in range(0, len())]          def get_average(self):              # this is our first version.    return sum/len();   print(\"The mean value was\",getAverage)     if numbers == [] :        raise ValueError('Please provide an integer list to calculate average from')       else         sum = 0       for i in range(0, len())]          def get_average(self):              # this is our first version.    return sum/len();   print(\"The mean value was\",getAverage)     if numbers == [] :        raise ValueError('Please provide an integer list to calculate average from')       else         sum = 0       for i in range(0, len())]          def get_average(self):              # this is our first version.    return sum/len();   print(\"The mean value was\",getAverage)     if numbers == [] :        raise ValueError('Please provide an integer list to calculate average from')       else         sum = 0       for i in range(0, len())]          def get_average(self):              # this is our first version.    return sum/len();   print(\"The mean value was\",getAverage)     if numbers == [] :        raise ValueError('Please provide an integer list to calculate average from')       else         sum = 0       for i in range(0, len())]          def get_average(self):              # this is our first version.    return sum/len();   print(\"The mean value was\",getAverage)     if numbers == [] :        raise ValueError('Please provide an integer list to calculate average from')       else         sum = 0       for i in range(0, len())]          def get_average(self):              # this is our first version.    return sum/len();   print(\"The mean value was\",get"}], "created": 1690423674, "id": "foobarbaz", "model": "Replit", "object": "text_completion", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 2023, "prompt_tokens": 25, "total_tokens": 2048}, "time": "330.92"}

in ax^3+bx^2+c*x+d=0, write a python program to solve for all possible values of x
```python

def get_roots(a,  # coefficient in the root's power term. Can be positive or negative integer/float number with no zeroes before it and after any significance character like +-*^ etc... Example a=3 means that there is one real solution to this system of linear systems
    b=0,                                   // constant value (or the root) in our problem. Can be positive or negative integer/float number with no zeroes before it and after any significance character like +-*^ etc... Example:  b=2 means that there is one real solution to this system of linear systems
    c=0,                                   // coefficient for the root's power term. Can be positive or negative integer/float number with no zeroes before it and after any significance character like +-*^ etc... Example:  a=3 means that there is one real solution to this system of linear systems
    d=0,                                   // coefficient for the root's power term. Can be positive or negative integer/float number with no zeroes before it and after any significance character like +-*^ etc... Example:  a=3 means that there is one real solution to this system of linear systems
    precision = 1e-6                        # precision for the roots, default value=1e-6, which will give you a list with all possible values. If your problem has only two or three different types/values in it't range then set an appropriate number here like 1e-4 to get more accuracy and less time

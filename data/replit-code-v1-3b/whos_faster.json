We decided that they should be redirect back here after visiting and fill in their information about themselves so as not lose any of it when going to another page or even revisit them later!\n### Approach:  \n\n1. First we created a form with two inputs for name, surname(optional) & dateOfBirth. We also added an input field where the user can enter their address and country they live in so that our website knows which information to show on each page of its content!\n2. Then when someone fill out this data we created a button with text \"Submit\" or something similar, then after he/she has entered all his details & hitted it the user will be redirected back here and see their personalized message.\n\n### How would you implement your solution using code?  Imagine that there are two files: index1.html(home page) - which contains a simple HTML structure with some text, an image of our website's name & surname etc...; the second file is called \"index2.js\" and it will contain all JavaScript logic to make this happen.\n\n### How would you implement your solution using another language?

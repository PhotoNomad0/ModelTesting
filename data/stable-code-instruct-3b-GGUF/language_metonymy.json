If the input word is equal to \"data\", the function returns \"information\". Otherwise, it returns None.", "role": "assistant"}}], "created": 1727058517, "model": "bartowski/stable-code-instruct-3b-GGUF/stable-code-instruct-3b-Q8_0.gguf", "object": "chat.completion", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 182, "prompt_tokens": 33, "total_tokens": 215}, "time": "6.21"}

Check the file permission for your private key (\"~/UserKey.pem\"). Ensure that it allows execution by the owner or another user who has logged in via SSH. If not, update the permissions to allow execution.\n2. If your private key requires passphrase (like `-----BEGIN RSA PRIVATE KEY-----\\nY9dG6iN...\\n\\n-----END DSA PRIVATE KEY-----` ) , then you need to either remove the passphrase or provide it via SSH config file or during command execution with `-o BatchMode=yes -o StrictHostKeyChecking=no -o ConnectTimeout=10` options.\n\n3. If none of these solutions work, try using a different private key or reach out to your system administrator for further assistance.", "role": "assistant"}}], "created": 1727058569, "model": "bartowski/stable-code-instruct-3b-GGUF/stable-code-instruct-3b-Q8_0.gguf", "object": "chat.completion", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 209, "prompt_tokens": 91, "total_tokens": 300}, "time": "7.16"}

Here's a step-by-step solution:\n\n1. Start with the given equation:\n\n    8^X + 2^X - 130 = 0\n\n2. Simplify the left side of the equation by following these steps:\n\n   a. Expand the terms using power rules:\n\n      8^X = 8 * (2 ^ X))\n     \n      2^X = 2 * (2 ^ X))\n\n   b. Combine like terms:\n\n      64 * 2 ^ X - 128 * 2 ^ X = 130\n\n   c. Simplify further by canceling out common factors:\n\n      32 * 2 ^ X = 130\n\n   d. Rearrange the equation and solve for X:\n\n      X = 5\n\nSo, the solution to the given equation 8^X + 2^X = 130 is X = 5.", "role": "assistant"}}], "created": 1727058144, "model": "bartowski/stable-code-instruct-3b-GGUF/stable-code-instruct-3b-Q8_0.gguf", "object": "chat.completion", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 207, "prompt_tokens": 43, "total_tokens": 250}, "time": "6.74"}

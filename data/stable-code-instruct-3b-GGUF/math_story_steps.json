Then, according to the given information, we have:\n\n2 + 2x = 8\n\nTo solve this equation, we first simplify it by subtracting all terms on the left-hand side (LHS) except for one term which is the leading coefficient:\n\n8 - 2(1+x) = 0\n\nNext, we can rearrange the equation to isolate x:\n\n2x + 2 = 8\n\nTo solve this quadratic equation, we first need to find its roots. The solutions are given by the formula:\n\n    (-b \u00b1 sqrt(b^2 - 4ac))) / (2a)\n\nIn our case, a = 1, b = 2, and c = 0. Plugging these values into the formula, we get:\n\nx = (-2 \u00b1 \u221a(4*1 + 4*(-2)))) / (2*1)\n\nSimplifying further, we have:\n\nx = (-2 \u00b1 \u221a(16 - 32)) / 2\n\nNow, let's solve this equation step by step.\n```python\nfrom math import sqrt\n\na = 1\nb = 2\nc = 0\n\n# Rearrange the quadratic equation to isolate x\ncoefficient = (b**2) - (4*a*c)\nx_value1 = (-b + sqrt(coefficient)) / (2*a)\nx_value2 = (-b - sqrt(coefficient))) / (2*a)\n\nx_value1, x_value2\n```", "role": "assistant"}}], "created": 1727058103, "model": "bartowski/stable-code-instruct-3b-GGUF/stable-code-instruct-3b-Q8_0.gguf", "object": "chat.completion", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 363, "prompt_tokens": 77, "total_tokens": 440}, "time": "13.15"}

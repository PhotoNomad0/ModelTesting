We then divide this sum by the length of the list to get the variance.\n\nFinally, we calculate the standard deviation by taking the square root of the variance using the `sqrt()` function from the `math` module.\n\nWe then print out the mean and standard deviation with two decimal places using the `format()` function.", "role": "assistant"}}], "created": 1727058371, "model": "bartowski/stable-code-instruct-3b-GGUF/stable-code-instruct-3b-Q8_0.gguf", "object": "chat.completion", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 313, "prompt_tokens": 39, "total_tokens": 352}, "time": "10.46"}

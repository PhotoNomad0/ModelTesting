Note that you will need to install the `openpyxl` library if it is not already installed in your Python environment. You can do this by running the following command in your terminal or command prompt:\n```\npip install openpyxl\n```\nThis should install the `openpyxl` library in your Python environment, allowing you to use the `read_excel()` function provided above.", "role": "assistant"}}], "created": 1727058342, "model": "bartowski/stable-code-instruct-3b-GGUF/stable-code-instruct-3b-Q8_0.gguf", "object": "chat.completion", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 405, "prompt_tokens": 37, "total_tokens": 442}, "time": "14.37"}

This can be done by subtracting the birth year of your sibling from the current year:\n\n```python\nimport datetime\n\ncurrent_year = datetime.datetime.now().year\nbirth_year = current_year - 6\n\nsister_birth_year = current_year - 80\n```\n\nNext, we can calculate how much time has passed between your birth and your sister's birth. We'll do this by subtracting your birth year from the current year:\n\n```python\nyears_passed = current_year - birth_year\n```\n\nFinally, we can calculate how old your sister is now. This is simply going to be the difference between the current year (again) and the birth year of your sister:\n\n```python\nsister_age = current_year - sister_birth_year\n```\n\nPutting it all together, here's what the code would look like:\n\n```python\nimport datetime\n\ncurrent_year = datetime.datetime.now().year\nbirth_year = current_year - 6\nyears_passed = current_year - birth_year\nsister_birth_year = current_year - 80\nsister_age = current_year - sister_birth_year\n```\n\nThis code will calculate the age of your sister at the present moment.", "role": "assistant"}}], "created": 1727058089, "model": "bartowski/stable-code-instruct-3b-GGUF/stable-code-instruct-3b-Q8_0.gguf", "object": "chat.completion", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 295, "prompt_tokens": 58, "total_tokens": 353}, "time": "10.01"}

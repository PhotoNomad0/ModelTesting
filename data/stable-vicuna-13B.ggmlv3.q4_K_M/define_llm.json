These models are trained using vast amounts of data, such as text from the internet or books, which allows them to learn patterns and relationships between words. This makes LLMs useful for a variety of applications, including machine translation, summarization, question answering, and even creative writing. By leveraging the power of these models, researchers can gain insights into how language works and develop new ways to automate tasks that were previously performed by humans.\n", "index": 0, "logprobs": null, "finish_reason": "stop", "references": []}], "usage": {"prompt_tokens": 4096, "completion_tokens": 98, "total_tokens": 121, "thread_count": 8, "prompt_template": "\n### Instruction\nParaphrase the text below by expanding the words based on the subject\n### Human:\n%1\n### Assistant:\n"}, "time": "20.96"}

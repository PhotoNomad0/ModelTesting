First, we need to isolate the variable 'X' in the left-hand side of the equation by subtracting 8 from both sides. This gives us (8 - 8) + (2 - 2) = 0. Next, we add 130 to both sides which results in X = 4. Therefore, solving for X in this equation yields a value of 4.\n", "index": 0, "logprobs": null, "finish_reason": "stop", "references": []}], "usage": {"prompt_tokens": 4096, "completion_tokens": 62, "total_tokens": 89, "thread_count": 8, "prompt_template": "\n### Instruction\nParaphrase the text below by expanding the words based on the subject\n### Human:\n%1\n### Assistant:\n"}, "time": "21.55"}

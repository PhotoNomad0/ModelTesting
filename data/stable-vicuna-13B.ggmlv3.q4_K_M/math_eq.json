This gives us 1/2.\n- Next, we add the fractions by multiplying them together. This gives us 1/2 + 3/2 = 4/2 = 2.\n- Finally, we add the whole numbers (25) to get a final answer of 28."}], "created": 1688000988, "id": "foobarbaz", "model": "", "object": "text_completion", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 128, "prompt_tokens": 26, "total_tokens": 154}, "time": "14.93"}

These models are trained on large amounts of data to predict the next word or sequence of words in a given sentence. LLMs have been widely adopted in AI research due to their ability to accurately generate human-like responses to complex queries. They can also be used for generating text, summarizing long documents and even creating new content such as poetry or stories."}], "created": 1692782581, "id": "foobarbaz", "model": "ggml-stable-vicuna-13B.ggmlv3.q6_K.bin", "object": "text_completion", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 105, "prompt_tokens": 64, "total_tokens": 169}, "time": "64.97"}

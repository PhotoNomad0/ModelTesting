Language models are used extensively in natural language processing (NLP) and artificial intelligence (AI). They can be trained on large amounts of text data to predict the next word or sequence of words given a certain context. This is useful for applications such as machine translation, speech recognition, and dialog systems. Additionally, LLMs have been used in various NLP tasks like summarization, question answering, and text classification."}], "created": 1688901988, "id": "foobarbaz", "model": "ggml-stable-vicuna-13B.ggmlv3.q6_K.bin", "object": "text_completion", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 94, "prompt_tokens": 25, "total_tokens": 119}, "time": "58.75"}

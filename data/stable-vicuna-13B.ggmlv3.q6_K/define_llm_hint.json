Help as much as you can.\n\n### User:\nexplain use of Large Language Models (LLM) in AI research\n\n### Response:\n\n\nLarge Language Models (LLMs) are artificial neural networks that have been trained on a massive amount of text data. They can be used for various tasks such as natural language processing, machine translation, and question answering. LLMs use deep learning techniques to learn the patterns in large amounts of text data and generate predictions based on this learned information. These models are often used in AI research due to their ability to process complex language structures and provide accurate results."}], "created": 1692567628, "id": "foobarbaz", "model": "ggml-stable-vicuna-13B.ggmlv3.q6_K.bin", "object": "text_completion", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 96, "prompt_tokens": 69, "total_tokens": 165}, "time": "21.85"}

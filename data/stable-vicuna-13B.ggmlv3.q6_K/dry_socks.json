The socks are now wet from the wash, so Tom hangs the 10 pairs of socks outside to dry. 10 hours later, he comes back outside to check on the socks. He feels each sock and notices they are all dry. He takes them back inside because they are all dry. How long will it take Tom to dry seven pairs of socks presuming the same weather conditions?\nAssuming that the weather conditions remain the same, it would take approximately 7 hours for Tom to dry 7 pairs of socks. This is based on the fact that each pair of socks took 10 hours to dry in the previous instance and there are now fewer pairs of socks to dry (since he already has 10 pairs)."}], "created": 1688902598, "id": "foobarbaz", "model": "ggml-stable-vicuna-13B.ggmlv3.q6_K.bin", "object": "text_completion", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 73, "prompt_tokens": 112, "total_tokens": 185}, "time": "20.47"}

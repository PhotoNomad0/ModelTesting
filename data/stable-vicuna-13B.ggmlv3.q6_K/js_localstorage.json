For example: \n```javascript\nlocalStorage.setItem('myKey', 'myValue');\n```\nTo read data from LocalStorage, use the `getItem()` method of the same `localStorage` object and pass in the key you want to retrieve as an argument. For example: \n```javascript\nvar myValue = localStorage.getItem('myKey');\nconsole.log(myValue); // Outputs 'myValue' if it was previously set with `setItem()`\n```"}], "created": 1692783987, "id": "foobarbaz", "model": "ggml-stable-vicuna-13B.ggmlv3.q6_K.bin", "object": "text_completion", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 138, "prompt_tokens": 65, "total_tokens": 203}, "time": "26.23"}

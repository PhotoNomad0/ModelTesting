Help as much as you can.\n\n### User:\nin javascript how do you save to and read back from localstorage\n\n### Response:\n\n\nIn JavaScript, you can use the `localStorage` object to store data locally on a user's browser. To save data in local storage, you can simply set an item with the key-value pair like this: \n```javascript\nlocalStorage.setItem('key', 'value');\n```\nTo retrieve data from local storage, use the `getItem` method and pass it the key as a parameter like this: \n```javascript\nvar value = localStorage.getItem('key');\nconsole.log(value);\n```\nNote that you can only store strings in local storage, so make sure to convert any data types before storing them. Also, be aware of security considerations when using local storage as it is not encrypted and can be accessed by anyone with access to the user's browser."}], "created": 1692571159, "id": "foobarbaz", "model": "ggml-stable-vicuna-13B.ggmlv3.q6_K.bin", "object": "text_completion", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 170, "prompt_tokens": 65, "total_tokens": 235}, "time": "120.77"}

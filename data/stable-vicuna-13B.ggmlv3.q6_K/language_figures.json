Help as much as you can.\n\n### User:\nwhat are the catagories of figures of speech?\n\n### Response:\n\n\nThe categories of figures of speech include simile, metaphor, hyperbole, personification, alliteration, onomatopoeia, and synecdoche. \n\nSimiles are comparisons using the words \"like\" or \"as\". Metaphors are a figure of speech that describes one thing as another without using like or as. Hyperbole is an exaggerated statement used for emphasis. Personification gives human characteristics to non-human objects. Alliteration is when two or more consonants begin with the same sound, while onomatopoeia are words that imitate sounds. Synecdoche is a figure of speech in which one part of something represents the whole thing."}], "created": 1692783773, "id": "foobarbaz", "model": "ggml-stable-vicuna-13B.ggmlv3.q6_K.bin", "object": "text_completion", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 155, "prompt_tokens": 63, "total_tokens": 218}, "time": "29.27"}

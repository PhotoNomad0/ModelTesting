Help as much as you can.\n\n### User:\nwhat are the catagories of figures of speech?\n\n### Response:\n\n\nThe categories of figures of speech include: simile, metaphor, hyperbole, personification, alliteration, onomatopoeia, and allegory. \nSimiles compare two things using the words \"like\" or \"as\". Metaphors are comparisons that describe one thing as another without using like or as. Hyperbole is an exaggerated statement used for emphasis. Personification gives human qualities to nonhuman objects or abstract concepts. Alliteration is a repetition of consonant sounds in nearby words. Onomatopoeia are words that imitate the sound they describe, such as buzz and hiss. Allegory is a story with a hidden meaning, often used to teach moral lessons."}], "created": 1692569979, "id": "foobarbaz", "model": "ggml-stable-vicuna-13B.ggmlv3.q6_K.bin", "object": "text_completion", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 160, "prompt_tokens": 63, "total_tokens": 223}, "time": "134.37"}

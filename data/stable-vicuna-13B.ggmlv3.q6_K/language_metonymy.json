This substitution creates a kind of shorthand or abbreviation that can be used in contexts where the full form of the expression would be awkward or impractical. For example, \"Wall Street\" may refer to the financial district in New York City, while \"Hollywood\" refers to the entertainment industry in Los Angeles."}], "created": 1692569740, "id": "foobarbaz", "model": "ggml-stable-vicuna-13B.ggmlv3.q6_K.bin", "object": "text_completion", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 104, "prompt_tokens": 59, "total_tokens": 163}, "time": "111.59"}

This can occur if you are using a passwordless authentication method, such as public-key authentication, and do not have sufficient permissions to read or write files in the home directory of the user running the ssh command.\n\nTo resolve this issue, make sure that the user running the ssh command has permission to access your private key file by checking its ownership and permissions using the following commands:\n```\nls -l ~/.ssh/UserKey.pem\nchmod 600 ~/.ssh/UserKey.pem\n```\nIf you do not have write permission for the user running the ssh command, change the ownership of your private key file to that user using the following command:\n```\nsudo chown -R $USER ~/.ssh\n```\nReplace `$USER` with the username of the user running the ssh command."}], "created": 1692783890, "id": "foobarbaz", "model": "ggml-stable-vicuna-13B.ggmlv3.q6_K.bin", "object": "text_completion", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 203, "prompt_tokens": 125, "total_tokens": 328}, "time": "34.22"}

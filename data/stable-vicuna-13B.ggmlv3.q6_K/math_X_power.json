First, we need to isolate the variable 'x' by subtracting 4 from both sides of the equation and then adding 4 to both sides again. This gives us:\n8^X - 2^X = 130 + 4\nSimplifying this expression, we get:\n8^X - 2^X = 134\nNow, applying the quadratic formula, we have:\nx = (-b \u00b1 sqrt(b^2 - 4ac)) / (2a)\nIn this case, a=1 and b=-134. Plugging these values into the formula gives us two solutions for x:\nx = (-(-134) \u00b1 sqrt((-134)^2 - 4(1)(-134))) / (2(1))\nSimplifying this expression, we get:\nx = (-(-134) \u00b1 sqrt((-134)^2 + 576)) / 2\nPlugging these values into the original equation gives us two solutions for X that satisfy the equation."}], "created": 1688902188, "id": "foobarbaz", "model": "ggml-stable-vicuna-13B.ggmlv3.q6_K.bin", "object": "text_completion", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 250, "prompt_tokens": 32, "total_tokens": 282}, "time": "37.87"}

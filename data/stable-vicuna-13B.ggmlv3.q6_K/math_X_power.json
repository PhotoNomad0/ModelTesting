We start by subtracting 8 from both sides of the equation, which gives us:\n\nx + 2 = 130 - 8\n\nNext we add 8 to both sides, giving us:\n\nx = 122\n\nTherefore, x is equal to 122."}], "created": 1692782804, "id": "foobarbaz", "model": "ggml-stable-vicuna-13B.ggmlv3.q6_K.bin", "object": "text_completion", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 83, "prompt_tokens": 71, "total_tokens": 154}, "time": "20.54"}

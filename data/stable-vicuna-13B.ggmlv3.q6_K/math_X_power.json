Help as much as you can.\n\n### User:\nIn 8^X+2^X=130 show how to solve for X\n\n### Response:\n\n\nWe need to isolate the variable x in order to find its value. We start by dividing both sides of the equation by 4, which gives us (8x + 2) / 4 = 130/4. Next we simplify this expression using basic arithmetic operations and get 8x + 2 = 35. Finally, we solve for x by subtracting 2 from both sides: 8x = 37. Therefore, the value of X is 4."}], "created": 1692567865, "id": "foobarbaz", "model": "ggml-stable-vicuna-13B.ggmlv3.q6_K.bin", "object": "text_completion", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 106, "prompt_tokens": 71, "total_tokens": 177}, "time": "23.06"}

Help as much as you can.\n\n### User:\nIn the morning, Emily decided to create some designs with her cereal bits. In total, she created 9 designs and used 63 cereal bits. About how many cereal bits were in each design? Do you think she used an equal number of cereal bits in each design?\n\n### Response:\n\n\nTo find out about how many cereal bits Emily used per design, we can divide the total amount of cereal bits (63) by the number of designs she created (9): \n63 / 9 = 7.11\nTherefore, each design contained approximately 7.11 cereal bits.\n\nRegarding whether Emily used an equal number of cereal bits in each design, we cannot say for certain without more information about the size and shape of her designs. However, it is possible that she may have used a similar amount of cereal bits in each design to create balanced and symmetrical compositions."}], "created": 1692567778, "id": "foobarbaz", "model": "ggml-stable-vicuna-13B.ggmlv3.q6_K.bin", "object": "text_completion", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 141, "prompt_tokens": 117, "total_tokens": 258}, "time": "27.68"}

Help as much as you can.\n\n### User:\nIn the morning, Emily decided to create some designs with her cereal bits. In total, she created 9 designs and used 63 cereal bits. About how many cereal bits were in each design? Do you think she used an equal number of cereal bits in each design?\n\n### Response:\n\n\nEmily used a total of 63 cereal bits to create her designs, so the average amount of cereal bits per design is (63/9) = 7.11 cereal bits per design. Therefore, each design contained approximately 7-8 cereal bits on average.\nNo, Emily did not use an equal number of cereal bits in each design as the total amount of cereal bits used was not evenly distributed among her designs."}], "created": 1692782735, "id": "foobarbaz", "model": "ggml-stable-vicuna-13B.ggmlv3.q6_K.bin", "object": "text_completion", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 104, "prompt_tokens": 117, "total_tokens": 221}, "time": "23.56"}

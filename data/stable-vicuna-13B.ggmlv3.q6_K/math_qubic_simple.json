Help as much as you can.\n\n### User:\nin x^3+x-130=0, use the cardano's formula to get the value for x\n\n### Response:\n\n\nThe solution is -2 and 4. The first root (-2) can be found by solving for x in the equation using Cardano's Formula: \nx^3 + x = 130 \nx^3 + x - 130 = 0 \n(x-1)(x+2)=0 \nTherefore, there are two real roots (-2 and 4). The second root (4) can be found by solving for the other root of the equation: \nx^3 + x = 130 \nx^3 - 6x + 130 = 0 \n(x-4)(x+2)=0 \nTherefore, there are two real roots (-2 and 4). The first root is -2."}], "created": 1692568077, "id": "foobarbaz", "model": "ggml-stable-vicuna-13B.ggmlv3.q6_K.bin", "object": "text_completion", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 170, "prompt_tokens": 78, "total_tokens": 248}, "time": "29.41"}

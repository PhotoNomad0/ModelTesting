The general form of a cubic equation is ax^3 + bx^2 + cx + d = 0 where a,b,c and d are constants. To use this formula we need to find the values for these constants by solving the given equation.\nThe first step in using Cardano\u2019s formula is to factorize the cubic equation into its standard form: x(x^2+px+q) = 0 where p, q and r are constants. To do this, we can use the following steps:\n1. Multiply both sides of the given equation by -130/x:\n-130/x * (x^3 + x \u2013 130) = (-130/x) * 0 => x(x^2+px+q) = 0\n2. Subtract p from both sides of the equation to eliminate the term involving \u2018p\u2019:\n-130/x * (x^3 + x \u2013 130) - p*(-130/x) => (-130/x)*(q+r) = 0\n3. Divide both sides of the equation by (-130/x):\n(-130/x)*(q+r)/(-130/x) => (q+r)=0\n4. Subtract r from both sides to eliminate the term involving \u2018r\u2019:\n-130/x * (q+r)/(-130/x) - (-130/x)*(r) => q=0\n5. Finally, we have found that p = 1 and q = 0. Substituting these values into the equation gives us:\n-130/x * (x^2+px+q) = 0 => -130/x * x^2 + (-130/x)*(1)+0 = 0 => (-130/x)^2 \u2013 130/x + 0 = 0\n6. Solving for \u2018x\u2019 we get:\n-130/x = -1 or x = 130/(-1) => x=130\nTherefore, the value of x that satisfies the given equation is x = 130."}], "created": 1688902341, "id": "foobarbaz", "model": "ggml-stable-vicuna-13B.ggmlv3.q6_K.bin", "object": "text_completion", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 516, "prompt_tokens": 39, "total_tokens": 555}, "time": "66.32"}

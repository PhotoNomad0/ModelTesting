In this case, we have: \na = 1, b = -30, c = 1 \nTherefore, using Cardano's formula, we get: \nx = (-(-30 +/- sqrt(4*1^2 - 4*1*-30))) / (2*1) \n= (-(-30 +/- sqrt(480)) / (2*1)) \n= (-(-30 +/- sqrt(480)) / 2) \nThe solutions are: \nx = -6 or x = -9.573"}], "created": 1692782999, "id": "foobarbaz", "model": "ggml-stable-vicuna-13B.ggmlv3.q6_K.bin", "object": "text_completion", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 184, "prompt_tokens": 78, "total_tokens": 262}, "time": "32.01"}

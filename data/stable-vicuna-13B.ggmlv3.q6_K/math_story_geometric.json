Help as much as you can.\n\n### User:\nHarmony used discarded paper to make notepads for her friends. She would fold five letter size pieces of paper three times then cut along the lines. She would then stack the smaller note papers and staple them together. How long would one notepad last if someone wrote ten notes per day?\n\n### Response:\n\n\nOne notepad should be able to last for 10 days, as it contains five sheets of paper that are folded three times and then cut into smaller sizes. If a person writes ten notes per day, they would use one sheet every two days. Therefore, the notepads will last for 5 x (3/2) = 7.5 days before needing to be refilled."}], "created": 1692567730, "id": "foobarbaz", "model": "ggml-stable-vicuna-13B.ggmlv3.q6_K.bin", "object": "text_completion", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 85, "prompt_tokens": 117, "total_tokens": 202}, "time": "21.73"}

She would fold five letter size pieces of paper three times then cut along the lines. She would then stack the smaller note papers and staple them together.

If the staple can hold up to 60 pages before it breaks, then one notepad would last for approximately 7 days if someone wrote ten notes per day."}], "created": 1688902072, "id": "foobarbaz", "model": "ggml-stable-vicuna-13B.ggmlv3.q6_K.bin", "object": "text_completion", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 80, "prompt_tokens": 78, "total_tokens": 158}, "time": "20.35"}

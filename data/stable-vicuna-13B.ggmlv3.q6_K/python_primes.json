For each number, it checks whether or not it's prime by using another loop that goes up to the square root of the current number. If any multiple of this smaller number is found, then the current number cannot be a prime and we move on to the next one. Otherwise, if no such multiple was found, we print out the current number as being prime.\nNote that this program assumes that you're using Python 3 (which has support for integer division), so it may not work in earlier versions of the language. Also, keep in mind that there are more efficient ways to generate and test primes than what's shown here!"}], "created": 1688902452, "id": "foobarbaz", "model": "ggml-stable-vicuna-13B.ggmlv3.q6_K.bin", "object": "text_completion", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 259, "prompt_tokens": 28, "total_tokens": 287}, "time": "30.18"}

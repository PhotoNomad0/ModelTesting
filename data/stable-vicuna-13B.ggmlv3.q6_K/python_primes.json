Help as much as you can.\n\n### User:\nwrite a Python program to print out the first 100 prime numbers\n\n### Response:\n\n\nHere is one way to do it in Python:\n```python\nfor i in range(2, 101):\n    for j in range(2, int(i ** 0.5) + 1):\n        if i % j == 0:\n            break\n    else:\n        print(i)\n```This program loops through numbers from 2 to 100 and checks each number to see if it is prime or not. If a number is found that is divisible by another number, the loop breaks and the current number is printed out as a prime number. This process continues until all prime numbers up to 100 are printed out."}], "created": 1692783164, "id": "foobarbaz", "model": "ggml-stable-vicuna-13B.ggmlv3.q6_K.bin", "object": "text_completion", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 145, "prompt_tokens": 67, "total_tokens": 212}, "time": "27.40"}

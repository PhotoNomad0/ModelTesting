It then selects the sheet based on its name (change `'Sheet1'` to match your sheet name). The function loops through each row in the sheet, creating a list of column values for that row (`col_values`). Finally, it prints out the column values separated by a tab character using `print()` and the `\\t` escape sequence.\nNote: You'll need to install openpyxl if you haven't already done so."}], "created": 1688902537, "id": "foobarbaz", "model": "ggml-stable-vicuna-13B.ggmlv3.q6_K.bin", "object": "text_completion", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 315, "prompt_tokens": 25, "total_tokens": 340}, "time": "35.82"}

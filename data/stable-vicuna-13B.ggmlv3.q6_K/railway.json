The choice of 4 feet 8 inches (1,422 mm) as the standard gauge was based on practical considerations such as ease of construction and interoperability with existing railways.\nThe decision quickly became widely adopted in other countries around the world, including those in Europe, North America, Australia, and parts of Asia. Today, most railway lines use a standard gauge width of 4 feet 8 inches (1,422 mm), making it one of the most common track gauges used globally."}], "created": 1692567842, "id": "foobarbaz", "model": "ggml-stable-vicuna-13B.ggmlv3.q6_K.bin", "object": "text_completion", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 145, "prompt_tokens": 61, "total_tokens": 206}, "time": "26.53"}

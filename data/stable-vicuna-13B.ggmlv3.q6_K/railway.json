Help as much as you can.\n\n### User:\nExplain origin of standard gauge for railways\n\n### Response:\n\n\nThe standard gauge for railways was first established in Great Britain during the 1830s and 40s, when a number of railway companies were building lines across the country. The decision to use this particular width of track (4 feet 8 inches or 1.42 meters) was made primarily as a practical matter: it allowed for easy interchangeability between different railways' rolling stock, and ensured that trains could travel at high speeds without derailing due to the curvature of the tracks.\n\nThe standard gauge quickly became widely adopted across Europe and North America, with many countries adopting it as their own national standard. Today, most railway lines in the world use this same width of track, making it easier for trains to travel between different networks and ensuring a high level of interoperability between railways around the globe."}], "created": 1692782783, "id": "foobarbaz", "model": "ggml-stable-vicuna-13B.ggmlv3.q6_K.bin", "object": "text_completion", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 180, "prompt_tokens": 61, "total_tokens": 241}, "time": "30.41"}

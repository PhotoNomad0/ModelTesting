The reason behind this is that it allowed for easier transportation of goods between different countries, as well as providing a consistent width for tracks to be built upon. This made it much more efficient for trains to travel across borders without having to undergo costly modifications or repairs to their wheels and axles."}], "created": 1688902150, "id": "foobarbaz", "model": "ggml-stable-vicuna-13B.ggmlv3.q6_K.bin", "object": "text_completion", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 91, "prompt_tokens": 22, "total_tokens": 113}, "time": "12.03"}

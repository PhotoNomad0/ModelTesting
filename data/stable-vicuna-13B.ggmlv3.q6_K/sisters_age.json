Help as much as you can.\n\n### User:\nwhen I was 6, my sister was half my age. Now I am 80. How old is my sister now? Calculate this step by step.\n\n### Response:\n\n\nStep-by-step calculation of the current age of your sister based on the information provided:\n1. When you were 6 years old, your sister was half your age - that means she was 3 years old at the time.\n2. Now you are 80 years old and we need to find out how many years have passed since then. To do this, subtract 80 from the current year: (current year) - (year when you were 6) = 2019 - 1974 = 45 years\n3. Since your sister was 3 years old at the time and we know that a half of her age is equal to your age, we can calculate how many years have passed since then: (current year) / 2 - (year when you were 6) / 2 = 45 / 2 - 6 / 2 = 17.5\n4. Since we cannot have a fraction of a half, we need to round it up or down to the nearest whole number: either 18 years passed since then (rounded up), or 17 years passed since then (rounded down). Let's assume that 18 years have passed - your sister is currently 21 years old.\nConclusion: Your sister is currently 21 years old."}], "created": 1692567670, "id": "foobarbaz", "model": "ggml-stable-vicuna-13B.ggmlv3.q6_K.bin", "object": "text_completion", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 284, "prompt_tokens": 86, "total_tokens": 370}, "time": "42.04"}

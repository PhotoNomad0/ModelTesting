Calculate this step by step.\n\n### Response:\n\n\nWe need to find the current age of your sister first. We know that when you were 6 years old, she was half your age which means she was 3 years old at that time. Now we are told that you are currently 80 years old so if we subtract your current age from the number of years ago when you were 6 and your sister was 3, we get:\n\n80 - (6-3) = 47\n\nTherefore, your sister is now 47 years old."}], "created": 1692782646, "id": "foobarbaz", "model": "ggml-stable-vicuna-13B.ggmlv3.q6_K.bin", "object": "text_completion", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 110, "prompt_tokens": 86, "total_tokens": 196}, "time": "23.57"}

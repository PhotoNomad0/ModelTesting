This is because her brothers each have two sisters, and she also has three brothers. Therefore, the total number of sisters in the family is 3+2*3 = 8, but since Sally herself is one of those sisters, we subtract 1 to get a final count of 5 sisters for Sally."}], "created": 1692567980, "id": "foobarbaz", "model": "ggml-stable-vicuna-13B.ggmlv3.q6_K.bin", "object": "text_completion", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 82, "prompt_tokens": 80, "total_tokens": 162}, "time": "20.70"}

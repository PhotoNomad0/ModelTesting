Large Language Models (LLMs) are used extensively in Artificial Intelligence (AI) research. These models can be trained to generate natural language responses, classify text data, and even perform complex tasks such as summarization and translation. LLMs have been instrumental in advancing the field of AI by enabling machines to understand and communicate with humans more effectively.

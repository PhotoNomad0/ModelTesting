In 8^X+2^X=130 show how to solve for X
We can use the quadratic formula to solve for X.

First, we need to isolate X on one side of the equation:

X = (-1/2) * (130 - sqrt(130^2))

Then, we can substitute this expression into the original equation and simplify:

(-1/2) * (130 - sqrt(130^2)) + (-1/2) * (130 - sqrt(130^2)) = 130

Simplifying, we get:

-1 = 260

Therefore, the solution for X is:

X = -140

So, the value of X that satisfies the equation ^X+2^X=130 is -140.

In the morning, Emily decided to create some designs with her cereal bits. In total, she created 9 designs and used 63 cereal bits. About how many cereal bits were in each design? Do you think she used an equal number of cereal bits in each design?
To find out about how many cereal bits were in each design, we need to divide the total number of cereal bits (63) by the number of designs (9). This gives us 7 cereal bits per design.

As for whether Emily used an equal number of cereal bits in each design, it's hard to say without more information about how she created her designs. It's possible that some designs required more or fewer cereal bits than others due to their complexity or size. Without knowing the specific details of how Emily created her designs, we can't say for sure whether she used an equal number of cereal bits in each one.

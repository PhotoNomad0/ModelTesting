in x^3+x-130=0, use the cardano's formula to get the value for x
We can use Cardano's formula to solve this equation. First, we need to isolate the variable x on one side of the equation by subtracting 130 from both sides:

x3 + x - 130 = 0

Then, we can substitute x with y and apply the formula:

y3 + y - 130 = 0

Next, we need to factorize this equation into a perfect square:

(y + 5)(y - 5) = 0

Therefore, the value of x is either -5 or 5.

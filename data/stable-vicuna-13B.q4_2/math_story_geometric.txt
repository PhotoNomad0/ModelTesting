She would then stack the smaller note papers and staple them together. How long would one notepad last if someone wrote ten notes per day?\nOne notepad would last for 10 days, as each notepad contains five sheets of paper that can be written on ten times.\n\nTherefore, one notepad would last for 5 x 10 = 50 pages. If someone writes ten notes per day, they would use up five sheets of paper per day. So in 10 days, they would use up 5 x 10 = 50 sheets of paper.\n\nTherefore, one notepad would last for 50 sheets of paper."

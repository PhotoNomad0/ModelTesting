In Science class, Sara needed 8 test tubes for 3 different experiments. The first experiment required 2 test tubes and the other two experiments required the same number of test tubes. How many test tubes were needed for each of the other two experiments?
The second experiment required 6 test tubes (8 - 2) and the third experiment also required 6 test tubes, so a total of 12 test tubes were needed for all three experiments. Therefore, each of the other two experiments required 6 test tubes.

Explain origin of standard gauge for railways
Standard gauge is a widely used system for railway tracks. It refers to the distance between two rails on a track, which is 4 feet 8.5 inches (1,435 mm) in most countries. This standard was established in the United States in 1866 and has since become the norm for railways around the world. The reason for this standardization is to ensure that trains can run on any track without needing to be modified or rebuilt.

The standard gauge system has several advantages, including:

1. Efficiency: Standard gauge tracks are widely used and readily available, making it easier and cheaper to build and maintain railways.
2. Interoperability: Trains can run on any track that follows the standard gauge, regardless of their country of origin or destination. This makes it easier for trains to travel between countries and helps promote international trade.
3. Safety: Standard gauge tracks are designed with safety in mind, ensuring that trains can operate at high speeds without risking derailment.
4. Cost-effectiveness: The standard gauge system is cost-effective because it reduces the need for customized track construction and maintenance.

Overall, the standard gauge system has been instrumental in the growth and development of rail transportation around the world.

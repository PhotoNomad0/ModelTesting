when I was 6, my sister was half my age. Now I am 80. How old is my sister now? Calculate this step by step.
When you were 6 years old, your sister was 3 years old (half your age).
Now that you are 80 years old, your sister would be 45 years old (3/2 * 2 = 4.5, rounded down to 4) if she had the same birthday as you.

The socks are now wet from the wash, so Tom hangs the 10 pairs of socks outside to dry. 10 hours later, he comes back outside to check on the socks. He feels each sock and notices they are all dry. He takes them back inside because they are all dry. How long will it take Tom to dry seven pairs of socks presuming the same weather conditions?\"\n1. **Initial thoughts**\n2. \ud83d\udca1 \"To find out how much time it took for Tom to dry ten pairs of socks, we can use the following formula: `time = (number of sock pairs) * (drying rate per pair).`\"\n3. \ud83d\udcc8 \"Let's assume that each pair of socks takes one hour to dry under the same weather conditions.\"\n4. **Formulation**\n5. ```markdown\n    time = (number of sock pairs) * (drying rate per pair)\n    10 hours = 10 * (drying rate per pair)\n```\n6. **Solution**\n7. \"Tom hung ten pairs of wet socks outside to dry, and after 10 hours he found that they were all dried.\"\n8. \"Since each pair took one hour to dry under the same weather conditions, it would take seven pairs (assuming no change in weather) `time = (number of sock pairs) * (drying rate per pair)`\"\n9. ```markdown\n    time = 7 * (drying rate per pair)\n    10 hours = 7 * (drying rate per pair)\n```\n10. **Conclusion**\n11. \"Therefore, it would take seven pairs of socks `time = (number of sock pairs) * (drying rate per pair)`\"\n12. ```markdown\n    time = 7 * (drying rate per pair)\n    10 hours = 7 * (drying rate per pair)\n```"}], "created": 1689190251, "id": "foobarbaz", "model": "ultralm-13b.ggmlv3.q4_0.bin", "object": "text_completion", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 358, "prompt_tokens": 210, "total_tokens": 568}, "time": "44.30"}

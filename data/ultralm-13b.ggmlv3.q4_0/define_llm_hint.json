Write a response that appropriately completes the request.\n\n### Instruction:\nexplain use of Large Language Models (LLM) in AI research\n\n### Response:\n\nLarge Language Models (LLMs) are an essential component of Artificial Intelligence (AI) research, particularly in the field of Natural Language Processing. LLMs are deep learning models that use a massive amount of text data to predict the probability distribution over sequences of words or phrases in a given context.\n\nThe primary application of LLMs is language generation tasks such as machine translation, summarization, and question answering systems. They can also be used for natural language understanding applications like sentiment analysis, named entity recognition, and chatbots. \n\nLLMs are trained on massive amounts of text data using a technique called \"unsupervised learning,\" which means that they do not require labeled training data to learn the patterns in the input text. This makes them very efficient for processing large volumes of unstructured textual data, such as social media posts or news articles.\n\nIn summary, LLMs are powerful tools used extensively in AI research and have numerous applications that can help us better understand natural language and generate more human-like responses to it."}], "created": 1692927216, "id": "foobarbaz", "model": "ultralm-13b.ggmlv3.q4_0.bin", "object": "text_completion", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 226, "prompt_tokens": 66, "total_tokens": 292}, "time": "28.92"}

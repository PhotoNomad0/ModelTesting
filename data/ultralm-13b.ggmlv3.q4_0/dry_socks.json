The socks are now wet from the wash, so Tom hangs the 10 pairs of socks outside to dry. 10 hours later, he comes back outside to check on the socks. He feels each sock and notices they are all dry.

How long will it take Tom to dry seven pairs of socks presuming the same weather conditions?\nIf we assume that the 10 pairs of socks took 10 hours to dry in similar weather conditions, then it is reasonable to expect that it would take 7/10 or 0.7 times as long for Tom to dry seven pairs of socks, which is approximately 7 hours."}], "created": 1689190207, "id": "foobarbaz", "model": "ultralm-13b.ggmlv3.q4_0.bin", "object": "text_completion", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 64, "prompt_tokens": 112, "total_tokens": 176}, "time": "11.53"}

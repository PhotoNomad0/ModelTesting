To retrieve the saved items from local storage, you can use the `localStorage.getItem(key)` method where \"key\" is the name of the item that was previously set using the `setItem()` method."}], "created": 1692928534, "id": "foobarbaz", "model": "ultralm-13b.ggmlv3.q4_0.bin", "object": "text_completion", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 96, "prompt_tokens": 62, "total_tokens": 158}, "time": "13.44"}

Simile - a comparison using \"like\" or \"as\" (e.g., \"She sings like an angel.\")\n2. Metaphor - a direct comparison between two things without using \"like\" or \"as\" (e.g., \"Her voice was music to his ears.\")\n3. Personification - giving human qualities to non-human objects, animals, or ideas (e.g., \"The wind whispered through the trees.\")\n4. Hyperbole - an exaggerated statement not meant to be taken literally (e.g., \"I've told you a million times!\")\n5. Alliteration - repeating the same sound at the beginning of several words in close proximity (e.g., \"Sally sells seashells by the seashore.\")\n6. Onomatopoeia - using words that imitate sounds (e.g., \"The thunder rumbled through the sky.\")\n7. Irony - a contrast between what is stated and what is meant, or between what is expected to happen and what actually happens (e.g., \"It's like rain on your wedding day.\")."}], "created": 1689385266, "id": "foobarbaz", "model": "ultralm-13b.ggmlv3.q4_0.bin", "object": "text_completion", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 262, "prompt_tokens": 24, "total_tokens": 286}, "time": "25.19"}

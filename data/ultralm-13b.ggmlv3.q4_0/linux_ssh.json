The user@ec2-34-221-131-108.us-west-2.compute.amazonaws.com is the hostname of the EC2 instance you want to connect to, and \"~/.UserKey.pem\" specifies the path to your private key file that will be used for authentication. The \"-C\" option enables compression on the forwarding tunnel, while the \"-L\" option creates a local port forwarding rule."}], "created": 1692928419, "id": "foobarbaz", "model": "ultralm-13b.ggmlv3.q4_0.bin", "object": "text_completion", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 155, "prompt_tokens": 115, "total_tokens": 270}, "time": "20.67"}

Write a response that appropriately completes the request.\n\n### Instruction:\nwhy does this command give error Permission denied (publickey):\n\nssh -i \"~/UserKey.pem\" -C -L 25900:localhost:5900 ec2-34-221-131-108.us-west-2.compute.amazonaws.com\n\n### Response:\n\nThe error message \"Permission denied (publickey)\" indicates that the server you are trying to connect to does not have the correct permissions set up for your public key. To resolve this issue, please follow these steps:\n\n1. Check if your private key is added to your Amazon EC2 instance's authorized_keys file. If it isn't, add it using the following command on your local machine: `ssh-copy-id -i \"~/UserKey.pem\" ec2-user@ec2-34-221-131-108.us-west-2.compute.amazonaws.com`\n2. Verify that the permissions on your private key file are set correctly by running `ls -l ~/.ssh/UserKey.pem`. The output should show that the owner is you and group is wheel, with read, write, and execute permission for both you (the owner) and everyone in the wheel group.\n3. Check if there's any firewall or security software blocking incoming connections to your private key file by temporarily disabling them and trying again."}], "created": 1692928448, "id": "foobarbaz", "model": "ultralm-13b.ggmlv3.q4_0.bin", "object": "text_completion", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 236, "prompt_tokens": 122, "total_tokens": 358}, "time": "28.53"}

Write a response that appropriately completes the request.\n\n### Instruction:\nIn 8^X+2^X=130 show how to solve for X\n\n### Response:\n\nTo solve this equation, we need to follow these steps:\n\nStep 1: Simplify the expression by combining like terms. In this case, there is only one term on each side of the equals sign, so it's already simplified.\n\nStep 2: Isolate X by moving all other variables to one side and X to the other side. So we have 8X + 2X = 130. Now move all terms with an X in them to one side (left) and everything else to the right. We get 8X - 2X = 130-2X.\n\nStep 3: Combine like terms on each side of the equation by adding or subtracting similar terms together. In this case, we have two X's so let's add them up and simplify to obtain 6X=128.\n\nStep 4: Solve for X by dividing both sides by 6 which gives us X = 21. Therefore the solution is X = 21."}], "created": 1692927555, "id": "foobarbaz", "model": "ultralm-13b.ggmlv3.q4_0.bin", "object": "text_completion", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 223, "prompt_tokens": 68, "total_tokens": 291}, "time": "27.04"}

In total, she created 9 designs and used 63 cereal bits. About how many cereal bits were in each design? Do you think she used an equal number of cereal bits in each design?\nTo find the average amount of cereal bits per design, we need to divide the total number of cereal bits (63) by the number of designs (9). The result is 7.00, which rounds up to 8 since Emily used whole numbers for her designs. So each design had an average of 8 cereal bits.\nNo, we cannot say that she used an equal number of cereal bits in each design because the total number of cereal bits (63) is not divisible by 9."}], "created": 1689189810, "id": "foobarbaz", "model": "ultralm-13b.ggmlv3.q4_0.bin", "object": "text_completion", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 118, "prompt_tokens": 78, "total_tokens": 196}, "time": "15.53"}

Write a response that appropriately completes the request.\n\n### Instruction:\n25 - 4 * 2 + 3 = ?\nShow your work.\n\n### Response:\n\nTo solve this problem, we can follow these steps:\n1. Start by multiplying both sides of the equation by 2 to get rid of the multiplication on one side and have a single variable on each side (4x + 6 = 8).\n2. Next, add 3 to both sides of the equation (4x + 6 + 3 = 8 + 3) which will give us an expression with only x's on either side: 7x = 11.\n3. Finally, divide both sides by 7 to solve for x and get our answer: x = 1.59 (rounded to two decimal places)."}], "created": 1692927589, "id": "foobarbaz", "model": "ultralm-13b.ggmlv3.q4_0.bin", "object": "text_completion", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 141, "prompt_tokens": 67, "total_tokens": 208}, "time": "19.96"}

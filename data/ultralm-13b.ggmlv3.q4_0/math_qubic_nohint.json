So, we will use the Quadratic Formula to find the solutions. The formula is as follows:\nx = (-b +/- sqrt(b^2 - 4ac)) / (2a)\nwhere a = 1, b = -130, and c = 1 in this case.\nPlugging these values into the equation, we get:\nx = ((-(-130) +/- sqrt((-130)^2 - 4(1)(1))) / (2(1)))\n= (-130 +/- sqrt(-169)) / (2)\n= (-130 +/- sqrt(17)) / 2\n= (-130 +/- 5.83) / 2\n= (-130 - 5.83) / 2 or (-130 + 5.83) / 2\nTo find the solutions, we need to solve for x in each case:\nCase 1: (-130 - 5.83) / 2 = -67.49 / 2\n= -33.74 (This is not a real number.)\nSo, there are no real roots of the equation in this case.\nCase 2: (-130 + 5.83) / 2 = -65.67\nTherefore, the solutions to x^3+x-130=0 are approximately -34 and -65."}], "created": 1689461096, "id": "foobarbaz", "model": "ultralm-13b.ggmlv3.q4_0.bin", "object": "text_completion", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 361, "prompt_tokens": 32, "total_tokens": 393}, "time": "135.56"}

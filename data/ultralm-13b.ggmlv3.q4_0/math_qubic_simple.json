Write a response that appropriately completes the request.\n\n### Instruction:\nin x^3+x-130=0, use the cardano's formula to get the value for x\n\n### Response:\n\nTo solve this equation using Cardano's Formula, we need to follow these steps:\n\nStep 1: Rewrite the equation in standard form by multiplying both sides of the equation with the LCD (Leading Coefficient of the Constant Term) which is 1. The equation becomes x^3+x-130=0*1=0. Now, we have a quadratic equation in the form ax^2 + bx = c\n\nStep 2: Use Cardano's Formula to solve for x by substituting values of a, b and c from step 1 into the formula. The value of 'a' is -3, 'b' is 1 and 'c' is -130. So, we get:\n\nx = (-3 +/- sqrt(9))/(2*(-1)) = (4/5) or (-7/5)\n\nStep 3: Simplify the answer by dividing both sides of the equation with x to obtain a single solution for x. The final result is either -7/5, which simplifies to -1.4 or 4/5, which simplifies to 0.8. Therefore, there are two solutions to this quadratic equation: x = -1.4 and x = 0.8"}], "created": 1692927750, "id": "foobarbaz", "model": "ultralm-13b.ggmlv3.q4_0.bin", "object": "text_completion", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 278, "prompt_tokens": 75, "total_tokens": 353}, "time": "31.54"}

She would fold five letter size pieces of paper three times then cut along the lines. She would then stack the smaller note papers and staple them together. How long would one notepad last if someone wrote ten notes per day?\nIf you write 10 notes per day, each with a maximum length of 5 letters, then in one month (30 days) you will have written about 300 notes. Since the note pad has five sheets folded and stapled together, it can hold approximately 60 pages or 180 letter-sized pieces of paper. This means that each notepad would last for a maximum of 180 / (5 x 10) = 36 days."}], "created": 1689189786, "id": "foobarbaz", "model": "ultralm-13b.ggmlv3.q4_0.bin", "object": "text_completion", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 107, "prompt_tokens": 78, "total_tokens": 185}, "time": "14.33"}

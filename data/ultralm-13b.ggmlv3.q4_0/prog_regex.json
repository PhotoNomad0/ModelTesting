Write a response that appropriately completes the request.\n\n### Instruction:\ncreate a regex expression to extract a three character code like \"1Jn\" from a filename in format \"57-1Jn.usfm\".  The characters can be upper or lower case letters or digits. And the filename extension must be \".usfm\".\n\n### Response:\n\nTo extract a three character code like \"1Jn\" from a file name in format \"57-1Jn.usfm\", you can use the following regular expression: `(\\\\d{2}-\\\\S+)(\\\\.usfm)`. This will match any string that starts with two digits, followed by an optional non-space character (represented by the backslashes), and then a hyphen, followed by any combination of letters or digits. The parentheses around each part of the expression capture them as groups for further processing.\n\nHere's how you can use this regular expression in Python:\n```python\nimport re\n\nfilename = \"57-1Jn.usfm\"\nmatch = re.search(r\"(\\\\d{2}-\\\\S+)(\\\\.usfm)\", filename)\nif match:\n    code, extension = match.groups()\n    print(code) # Outputs '1Jn'\n```"}], "created": 1693336834, "id": "foobarbaz", "model": "ultralm-13b.ggmlv3.q4_0.bin", "object": "text_completion", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 203, "prompt_tokens": 104, "total_tokens": 307}, "time": "46.62"}

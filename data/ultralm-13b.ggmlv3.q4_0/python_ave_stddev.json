Write a response that appropriately completes the request.\n\n### Instruction:\nin python calculate the average and standard deviation of a list of numbers\n\n### Response:\n\nTo calculate the average and standard deviation of a list of numbers in Python, you can use the `statistics` module. Here's an example code snippet that demonstrates how to do it:\n```python\nimport statistics\n\nnumbers = [10, 20, 30, 40]\naverage = statistics.mean(numbers) # calculates average of numbers in the list\nstandard_deviation = statistics.stdev(numbers) # calculates standard deviation of numbers in the list\n```\nThe `statistics` module provides several functions for calculating different statistical measures such as mean, median, mode, variance and standard deviation."}], "created": 1692927989, "id": "foobarbaz", "model": "ultralm-13b.ggmlv3.q4_0.bin", "object": "text_completion", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 138, "prompt_tokens": 62, "total_tokens": 200}, "time": "17.33"}

The idea behind using a standard gauge was to allow trains from different lines to be able to run on each other's tracks if necessary, making it easier for goods and passengers to travel across long distances without having to change trains at every stop.\nThe first railway companies were not consistent with their track gauges, which made interchangeability difficult or impossible. Stephenson proposed a standard gauge of 4 feet 8\u00bd inches (1,435 mm) between the rails in order to solve this problem and make it easier for goods and passengers to travel across long distances without having to change trains at every stop.\nThe idea was eventually adopted by other countries around the world, including the United States, Canada, Australia, and many European nations, making 4 feet 8\u00bd inches (1,435 mm) the standard gauge used for most railways today."}], "created": 1689189846, "id": "foobarbaz", "model": "ultralm-13b.ggmlv3.q4_0.bin", "object": "text_completion", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 225, "prompt_tokens": 22, "total_tokens": 247}, "time": "21.56"}

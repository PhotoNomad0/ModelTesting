Write a response that appropriately completes the request.\n\n### Instruction:\nExplain origin of standard gauge for railways\n\n### Response:\n\nThe standard gauge for railways was first introduced in 1825 by George Stephenson, an English civil engineer and railway pioneer. The idea behind the standard gauge was to create a uniform width between the rails that would allow trains from different countries to run on each other's tracks without any difficulty. This meant that goods could be transported more efficiently across borders, which helped to boost trade and commerce in Europe during the 19th century. Today, most railways around the world use standard gauge for their tracks, with a few exceptions such as Russia, who uses broad gauge (1520mm) instead of standard gauge (1435mm)."}], "created": 1692927528, "id": "foobarbaz", "model": "ultralm-13b.ggmlv3.q4_0.bin", "object": "text_completion", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 138, "prompt_tokens": 58, "total_tokens": 196}, "time": "17.94"}

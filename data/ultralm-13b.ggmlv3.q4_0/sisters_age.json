Write a response that appropriately completes the request.\n\n### Instruction:\nwhen I was 6, my sister was half my age. Now I am 80. How old is my sister now? Calculate this step by step.\n\n### Response:\n\nFirst, we need to find the current age of your sister using the information given in the instruction. Since you are currently 80 years old and when you were 6, your sister was half your age, then she would have been 34 years old at that time. To calculate her current age, subtract her age from yours:\n```markdown\nCurrent Age of Sister = Current Age of You - Half Your Age When You Were 6\n                      = 80 - (1/2) * 6\n                      = 80 - 3\n                      = 77\n```\nTherefore, your sister is currently 77 years old."}], "created": 1692927240, "id": "foobarbaz", "model": "ultralm-13b.ggmlv3.q4_0.bin", "object": "text_completion", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 142, "prompt_tokens": 83, "total_tokens": 225}, "time": "23.64"}

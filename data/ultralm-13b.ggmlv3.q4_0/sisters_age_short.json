Write a response that appropriately completes the request.\n\n### Instruction:\nwhen I was 6, my sister was half my age. Now I am 80. How old is my sister now?\n\n### Response:\n\nYour sister's current age can be calculated using a simple formula - your sister's present age = (present age of the speaker) x 2 + (your sister's half-age when you were 6). So, if you are currently 80 years old, then at that time you were 14 years old. And since your sister was half your age, she would have been 7 years old. To find out her current age, we need to apply the formula:\n\nPresent age of your sister = (present age of speaker) x 2 + (your sister's half-age when you were 6)\nCurrent age of your sister = present age of your sister - 7\nTherefore, if you are currently 80 years old, then your sister is now approximately 53 years old."}], "created": 1692927319, "id": "foobarbaz", "model": "ultralm-13b.ggmlv3.q4_0.bin", "object": "text_completion", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 176, "prompt_tokens": 76, "total_tokens": 252}, "time": "79.46"}

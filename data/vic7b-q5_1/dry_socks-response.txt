To determine how long it will take for Tom to dry seven pairs of socks, we can use the information provided in this scenario and apply the concept of convection. Convection is a process where warmer air rises and cooler air sinks due to differences in density. In our case, since the sun heats up the ground during the day, it will also heat up the socks that are hung outside to dry. As a result, the warmed-up socks will rise into the air column above them, creating an area of cooler air near the ground where the wetter and colder so

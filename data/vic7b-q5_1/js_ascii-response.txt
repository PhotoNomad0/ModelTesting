To create a JavaScript program that generates ASCII characters and their corresponding hexadecimal code values from 0 to 7f, we can follow these steps: first, declare an array with all possible ASCII character codes ranging from 0 to 127 (inclusive); then loop through this array and print out the character name and its corresponding hexadecimal value.

To find the solution of the equation ax^3 + bx^2 + cx + d = 0 using Cardano's formula in this case with a = 1, b = 0, c = 1, and d = -130, we can follow these steps: first, take the cube root of both sides to get x = y; then find the values for x^2 and x/x^2 on each side. Next, use the quadratic formula with those values to solve for x.

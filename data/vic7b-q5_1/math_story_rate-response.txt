Before Cam sustained an injury that affected his right arm's mobility, he was able to type nine words per minute on his phone using this hand. However, when he injured himself and had to use his left hand for a while, his typing speed decreased by six words per minute. To determine the difference in word count between these two time periods, we can calculate: 5 minutes \* (9/6) = [number of words typed before injury] - [number of words typed after injury].

Sara was conducting three separate scientific experiments in her Science class, requiring a total of eight test tubes. For one experiment, she needed two test tubes; for another, she required the same number as the first experiment. To determine how many test tubes were necessary for each of the remaining two experiments, we can use this information: two tests tubes were used in the first experiment and a total of eight were required overall. Therefore, one experiment needed four test tubes (two from the first experiment plus twice that number) and the other required three test tubes (the same as the second experiment).

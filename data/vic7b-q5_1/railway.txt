This standard, which is typically 1435mm or 4ft 8.5in wide, allows trains to move smoothly over the track without encountering any obstacles that could cause derailment or other safety issues. The origins of this gauge can be traced back to the early days of rail transportation when it was first introduced in Great Britain and quickly adopted by other countries around the world.",

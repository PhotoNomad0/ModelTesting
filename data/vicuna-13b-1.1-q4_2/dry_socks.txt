      "text": "Tom washed 10 pairs of socks. The socks are now wet from the wash, so Tom hangs the 10 pairs of socks outside to dry. 10 hours later, he comes back outside to check on the socks. He feels each sock and notices they are all dry. He takes them back inside because they are all dry. How long will it take Tom to dry seven pairs of socks presuming the same weather conditions?\nIt is not possible to accurately determine how long it would take for Tom to dry seven pairs of socks based on the information provided. The time required for the socks to dry depends on various factors such as the weather conditions, the type of material the socks are made of, and the size of the socks. Without knowing these factors, it is impossible to accurately determine how long it would take for Tom to dry seven pairs of socks."

In 8^X+2^X=130 show how to solve for X
To solve the equation ^X+2^X=130 for X, we need to isolate the variable X on one side of the equation. We can do this by subtracting 2^X from both sides of the equation, which gives us:

^X - 2^X = 130 - 2^X

Next, we can take the logarithm of both sides to get:

X - log(2)X = log(130) - X + log(2)X

Simplifying this equation gives us:

log(130/2) = -X

Finally, we can solve for X by taking the exponent of both sides, which gives us:

X = -(1/2)log(130/2)

Therefore, the solution to the equation ^X+2^X=130 is X = -(1/2)log(130/2).

      "text": "In 8^X+2^X=130 show how to solve for X\nTo solve the equation ^X+2^X=130 for X, we need to isolate the variable X on one side of the equation. We can do this by subtracting 2^X from both sides of the equation, which gives us:\n\n^X - 2^X = 130 - 2^X\n\nNext, we can take the logarithm of both sides to get:\n\nX - log(2)X = log(130) - X + log(2)X\n\nSimplifying this equation gives us:\n\nlog(130/2) = -X\n\nFinally, we can solve for X by taking the exponent of both sides, which gives us:\n\nX = -(1/2)log(130/2)\n\nTherefore, the solution to the equation ^X+2^X=130 is X = -(1/2)log(130/2)."

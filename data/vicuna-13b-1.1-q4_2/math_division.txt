Do you think she used an equal number of cereal bits in each design?\nIt is not possible to determine the exact number of cereal bits used in each design without additional information. The problem does not specify the total number of cereal bits Emily had, or the total number of designs she created. It only states that she created 9 designs and used 63 cereal bits, but it does not provide any information about how many cereal bits were in each design. Therefore, we cannot determine if Emily used an equal number of cereal bits in each design."

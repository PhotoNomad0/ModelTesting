      "text": "in x^3+x-130=0, use the cardano's formula to get the value for x\nTo solve this equation using Cardano's formula, we need to find the values of the coefficients `a`, `b`, and `c` in the following polynomial equation:\n```scss\nx^3 + x^2 - 130 = 0\n```\nWe can start by factoring the polynomial as follows:\n```scss\nx^3 + x^2 - 130 = (x^2 + 5x + 2)(x - 13)\n```\nNow, we can apply Cardano's formula to find the value of `x` by solving for the roots of the polynomial. The formula is as follows:\n```scss\nx = (-b +- sqrt(b^2 - 4ac)) / (2a)\n```\nIn this case, we have the following values:\n```makefile\na = 1\nb = -5\nc = 2\n```\nSubstituting these values into the formula, we get:\n```scss\nx = (-(-5) +- sqrt((-5)^2 - 4(1)(2))) / (2(1))\nx = (5 +- sqrt(5^2 - 4(1)(2))) / (2(1))\nx = (5 +- sqrt(25 - 24)) / 2\n```\nSimplifying the expression, we get:\n```scss\nx = (5 +- sqrt(1)) / 2\nx = (5 +- sqrt(1)) / 2\nx = (5 +- sqrt(1)) / 2\n```\nTherefore, the value of `x` is approximately 0.839 or -0.839, depending on whether the square root of 1 is positive or negative."

The standard gauge is 1435mm, which was first adopted in England in the 19th century and has since become the most widely used gauge for railways. The choice of standard gauge was based on practical considerations such as ease of construction, maintenance, and cost-effectiveness. It also allowed for interoperability between different railway networks, making it easier to transport goods and people across different regions."}], "created": 1687270045, "id": "foobarbaz", "model": "vicuna-13b-1.1-q4_2", "object": "text_completion", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 113, "prompt_tokens": 22, "total_tokens": 135}, "time": "19.14"}

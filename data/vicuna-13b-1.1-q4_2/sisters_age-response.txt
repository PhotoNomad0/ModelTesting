when I was 6, my sister was half my age. Now I am 80. How old is my sister now? Calculate this step by step.
To calculate the age of your sister now, we can use the following steps:

1. Determine your current age. You mentioned that you are currently 80 years old.
2. Find your sister's current age by subtracting your current age from the age difference between the two of you when you were 6 years old and your sister was half your age. When you were 6, you were 6 - (1/2) = 3 years older than your sister.

Therefore, your sister's current age would be 80 - 3 = <<80-3=77>>77 years old.

These models are designed to process and analyze vast amounts of natural language data, enabling them to understand human communication with a high degree of accuracy. As such, LLMs have been used in various AI applications, including machine translation, sentiment analysis, and text generation. In the field of AI research, LLMs play an important role in advancing our understanding of natural language processing (NLP) and developing new NLP technologies that can improve human-computer interaction.", "index": 0, "logprobs": null, "finish_reason": "stop", "references": []}], "usage": {"prompt_tokens": 4096, "completion_tokens": 92, "total_tokens": 115, "thread_count": 4, "prompt_template": "\n### Instruction\nParaphrase the text below by expanding the words based on the subject\n### Human:\n%1\n### Assistant:\n"}, "time": "53.17"}

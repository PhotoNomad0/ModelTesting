To solve this problem, we need to find the values of X that satisfy the equation. One way to do this is by using a process called exponentiation, where we raise 8 and 2 to different powers until they equal 130. We can start by finding the value of X when (8^X) = 45 and then solve for X in terms of 2^X. Next, we will find the value of X when (2^X)", "index": 0, "logprobs": null, "finish_reason": "stop", "references": []}], "usage": {"prompt_tokens": 4096, "completion_tokens": 94, "total_tokens": 121, "thread_count": 4, "prompt_template": "\n### Instruction\nParaphrase the text below by expanding the words based on the subject\n### Human:\n%1\n### Assistant:\n"}, "time": "24.77"}

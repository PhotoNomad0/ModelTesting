The first experiment required only two test tubes, while the remaining two experiments both used the same number of test tubes as each other. To determine how many test tubes were necessary for each of these additional experiments, we can simply divide the total number of test tubes by the number that was not used in the first experiment (which is 8 / 2 = 4). This means that Sarah needed four test tubes for each of the other two experiments.", "index": 0, "logprobs": null, "finish_reason": "stop", "references": []}], "usage": {"prompt_tokens": 4096, "completion_tokens": 105, "total_tokens": 164, "thread_count": 4, "prompt_template": "\n### Instruction\nParaphrase the text below by expanding the words based on the subject\n### Human:\n%1\n### Assistant:\n"}, "time": "22.08"}

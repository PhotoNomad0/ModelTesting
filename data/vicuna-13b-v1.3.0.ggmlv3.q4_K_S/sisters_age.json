This means that she was three years younger than you at the time. Now that you are eighty years old, it's possible to calculate how old your sister is today using simple math. To do this, we can subtract your current age from your sister's current age and add the number of years between your ages when you were six and now (which is 80 - 6 = 74). This gives us a total of 74 + 3 = 77, which means that your sister is currently 77 years old", "index": 0, "logprobs": null, "finish_reason": "stop", "references": []}], "usage": {"prompt_tokens": 4096, "completion_tokens": 100, "total_tokens": 140, "thread_count": 4, "prompt_template": "\n### Instruction\nParaphrase the text below by expanding the words based on the subject\n### Human:\n%1\n### Assistant:\n"}, "time": "21.58"}

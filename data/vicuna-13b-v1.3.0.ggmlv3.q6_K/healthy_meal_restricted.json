I can't have dairy, garlic, honey, almonds\n### Assistant:\n\nHere is a sample meal plan that meets your dietary restrictions:\n\n* Breakfast: Oatmeal with berries and a drizzle of maple syrup. (Note: Maple syrup contains small amounts of dairy, so you may want to use a dairy-free alternative.)\n* Lunch: Grilled chicken salad with mixed greens, cherry tomatoes, cucumbers, and avocado. Dressing: olive oil and lemon juice. (Note: Olive oil is okay, but be sure to check the label of any store-bought dressings for dairy or other restrictions.)\n* Snack: Carrots and hummus. (Note: Be sure to choose a dairy-free hummus.)\n* Dinner: Grilled salmon with roasted vegetables (such as broccoli, cauliflower, and bell peppers). (Note: Be sure to check the seasonings used on the vegetables for any dairy or other restrictions.)\n\nRemember to always double-check labels and ingredients to ensure that all foods are safe for you to eat."}], "created": 1688121459, "id": "foobarbaz", "model": "", "object": "text_completion", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 249, "prompt_tokens": 56, "total_tokens": 305}, "time": "32.61"}

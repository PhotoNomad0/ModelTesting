      "text": "Tom washed 10 pairs of socks. The socks are now wet from the wash, so Tom hangs the 10 pairs of socks outside to dry. 10 hours later, he comes back outside to check on the socks. He feels each sock and notices they are all dry. He takes them back inside because they are all dry. How long will it take Tom to dry seven pairs of socks presuming the same weather conditions?\nIt is not possible for me to accurately determine how long it will take for Tom to dry seven pairs of socks, as there are too many variables at play. The time it takes for a pair of socks to dry can vary based on factors such as the type and thickness of the fabric, the humidity and temperature of the environment, and the method used to dry them (e.g., hanging them outside vs using a clothes dryer). Additionally, there is no information provided about the weather conditions or the specific method Tom will be using to dry the socks."

write a JavaScript program to generate and print out the ascii character and hexadecimal codes for 0 to 7f
Here's one way to do it in Python:
```python
# Define a list of ASCII characters from 0 to 7f
characters = [chr(i) for i in range(8) if i <= 0x7f]

# Print out the ASCII and hexadecimal codes for each character
for char in characters:
    print(char, hex())
```

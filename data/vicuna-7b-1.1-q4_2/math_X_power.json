Factorize the left-hand side (LHS) of the equation:\n(1 + 2)^X = 130\n2. Factorize the right-hand side (RHS) of the equation:\n(1 + 2)^X = (1^2)^X \\* (2^2)^X\n3. Identify common factors between the LHS and RHS:\n(1+2)^X = (1^2)^X \\* (2^2)^X = (1)^X \\* (2^2)^X\n4. Apply the distributive property of multiplication over the common factor on the LHS:\n(1+2)^X = 1^X \\* (2^2)^X\n5. Simplify the expression by using the binomial theorem for squaring a number:\n(1+2)^X = (1+2)^X \\* (1-1)^X \\* (1+2)^X = (1+4)^X - 1^X\n6. Substitute the simplified expression into the RHS of the equation to obtain X:\n(1+2)^X = (1+4)^X - 1^X = (5)^X\n7. Therefore, we have solved for X in the equation in ^X+2^X=130 as X = 5."}], "created": 1687337295, "id": "foobarbaz", "model": "vicuna-7b-1.1-q4_2", "object": "text_completion", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 323, "prompt_tokens": 32, "total_tokens": 355}, "time": "80.94"}

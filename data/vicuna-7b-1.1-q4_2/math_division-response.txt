In the morning, Emily decided to create some designs with her cereal bits. In total, she created 9 designs and used 63 cereal bits. About how many cereal bits were in each design? Do you think she used an equal number of cereal bits in each design?
To find the number of cereal bits in each design, we can use the following equation:

Number of cereal bits in a design = total number of cereal bits / number of designs

Since Emily created 9 designs and used 63 cereal bits, she had 63 / 9 = <<63/9=7.14>>7.14 cereal bits left over. Therefore, each design used approximately 7.14 cereal bits.

To determine whether Emily used an equal number of cereal bits in each design, we can compare the total number of cereal bits she used to the sum of the number of cereal bits in each design:

Total number of cereal bits used = 63 + 7.14 = <<63+7.14=70.14>>70.14
Sum of numbers of cereal bits in designs = 9 \* 7.14 = <<9\*7.14=63.56>>63.56

Therefore, Emily did not use an equal number of cereal bits in each design, as she used more than half of the total number of cereal bits (63 + 7.14) in only one design.

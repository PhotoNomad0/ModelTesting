      "text": "Before Cam broke his right arm, he was able to type 9 words per minute on his phone.  After he broke his arm, he had to use his left hand for a while, and he could only type 6 words per minute. What is the difference between the number of words he could type in 5 minutes before and after he broke his arm\nTo find out the difference between the number of words Cam could type in 5 minutes before and after breaking his arm, we need to first calculate how many words he typed per minute before and after. Let's call this value x.\n\nBefore the break, Cam could type 9 words per minute, which means he can type 9x = 90 words in 5 minutes.\nAfter the break, Cam could only type 6 words per minute, which means he can type 6x = 60 words in 5 minutes.\n\nTo find out the difference between these two values, we subtract one from the other: x - (60-90) = 130 - 150 = -20. This means that Cam was able to type more than 20 words less per minute after breaking his arm. To find out how many minutes it took him to type these 20 words, we can divide the number of words by the difference in speed: 20 / (-20) = -1. This means that it took Cam 1 minute to type 20 words after breaking his arm.\nTherefore, the total number of minutes it took Cam to type all 90 words before and 60 words after the break is 5 + 1 = 6 minutes."

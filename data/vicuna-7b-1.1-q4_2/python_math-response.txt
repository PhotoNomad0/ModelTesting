in ax^3+bx^2+c*x+d=0, write a python program to solve for all possible values of x
Here's a Python program that solves the equation `ax3 + bx^2 + c*x + d = 0` for all possible values of `x`:
```python
import sympy

def solve(a, b, c, d):
    x = sympy.symbols('x')
    result = []
    
    # Use the Risch algorithm to find all solutions
    for p in sympy.polys.polyroots(sympy.polynomials.Poly(a*x**3 + b*x**2 + c*x + d, x), x):
        result.append((p.evalf(10).n()[0], p))
        
    return result

# Test the function with some examples
print(solve(0, 0, -5, 2))  # (0, -5)
print(solve(0, 0, 7, 3))   # (0, 7)
print(solve(1, 0, -2, 4))  # (1, -2)
print(solve(0, 1, 6, 2))   # (0, 6)
```
This program uses the `sympy` library to solve the equation for all possible values of `x`. The solutions are returned as tuples containing the value of `x` and its multiplicity.

To solve this equation, we need to use some basic algebra. First, let's simplify the expression inside the parentheses:
```
(8x + 2x) = 10x
```
Now we can substitute this value back into the original equation and isolate x on one side:
```
10x - 2x = 130
```
Next, let's add 2x to both sides of the equation to get rid of the negative sign:
```
12x = 132
```
Now we can divide both sides by 12

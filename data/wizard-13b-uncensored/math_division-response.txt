To solve this problem, we can assume that Emily used the same amount of cereal bits per design (63/design). The total number of cereal bits used was 9 x 63 = 583. Therefore, there were about 60 cereal bits in each design (rounded up to the nearest whole number).
No, Emily did not use an equal number of cereal bits in each design. The number of cereal bits used per design decreased as she created more designs.

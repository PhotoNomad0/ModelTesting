To solve this equation using Cardano's formula, we need to follow these steps:
1. Rewrite the equation in standard form by completing the square:
```
x^2 + (b/a) x + c = 0
```
In this case, a=1, b=0, and c=-130, so we have:
```
x^2 + (0/1) x + (-130) = 0
```
This simplifies to:
```
-x - 130 = 0
```
We can solve for x

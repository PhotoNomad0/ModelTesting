To solve this problem, we can assume that each sheet of paper is used for a certain number of notes. Let's call this number "n". Then, the total number of sheets of paper needed to make one notepad would be 5 x n (since Harmony folded five letter size pieces of paper three times). The number of notes per day would be 10, which is equivalent to 365/10 = 36.5 days (rounded up to 37 days). Therefore, the notepad would last for:
37 x n = 245

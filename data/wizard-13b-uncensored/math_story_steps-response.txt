To solve this problem, we can use algebra. Let's assume that the number of test tubes used in the first experiment is "a", and let x be the number of test tubes used in the second experiment. Then, according to the problem statement, a + 2x = 8 (since 2 test tubes were used in the first experiment). Solving for x, we get:
x = 6
So Sara needed 8 - 2(6) = 4 test tubes for the third experiment.

Let's assume that the number of test tubes used in the first experiment is \"a\", and let x be the number of test tubes used in the second experiment. Then, according to the problem statement, a + 2x = 8 (since 2 test tubes were used in the first experiment). Solving for x, we get:\nx = 6\nSo Sara needed 8 - 2(6) = 4 test tubes for the third experiment.", "index": 0, "logprobs": null, "finish_reason": "stop", "references": []}], "usage": {"prompt_tokens": 4096, "completion_tokens": 77, "total_tokens": 136, "thread_count": 4, "prompt_template": "\n### Instruction\nParaphrase the text below by expanding the words based on the subject\n### Human:\n%1\n### Assistant:\n"}, "time": "18.98"}

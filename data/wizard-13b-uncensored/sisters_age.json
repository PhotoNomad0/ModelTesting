Let's assume that your sister's current age is \"x\". Then, when you were 6, her age was (1/2)x. Now, since you are 80 and your sister's age is unknown, we can set up an equation:\n80 = (1/2)(x) + y\nwhere y is some constant representing the difference in age between you and your sister when you were both 6. Solving for x, we get:\nx = 40 - y\nNow we need to figure out what", "index": 0, "logprobs": null, "finish_reason": "stop", "references": []}], "usage": {"prompt_tokens": 4096, "completion_tokens": 89, "total_tokens": 129, "thread_count": 4, "prompt_template": "\n### Instruction\nParaphrase the text below by expanding the words based on the subject\n### Human:\n%1\n### Assistant:\n"}, "time": "19.18"}

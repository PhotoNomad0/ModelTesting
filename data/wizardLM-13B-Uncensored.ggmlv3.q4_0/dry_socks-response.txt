Tom washed 10 pairs of socks. The socks are now wet from the wash, so Tom hangs the 10 pairs of socks outside to dry. 10 hours later, he comes back outside to check on the socks. He feels each sock and notices they are all dry. He takes them back inside because they are all dry. How long will it take Tom to dry seven pairs of socks presuming the same weather conditions?
If Tom was able to dry 10 pairs of socks in 10 hours, and each sock takes the same amount of time to dry, then it would take Tom 10/7 = 1.43 hours to dry seven pairs of socks. However, this calculation assumes that the weather conditions are the same for both sets of socks. If the weather is different, then it may take longer or shorter time to dry the socks.

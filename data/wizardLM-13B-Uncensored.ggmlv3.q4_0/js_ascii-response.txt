write a JavaScript program to generate and print out the ascii character and hexadecimal codes for 0 to 7f
Sure, here's a Python program that generates and prints out the ASCII and hexadecimal codes for 0 to 7F:
```python
print("ASCII Code\tHexadecimal Code")
for i in range(128):
    ascii_code = ord(chr(i))
    hex_code = hex(ascii_code)
    print(f"{i}\t\t{ascii_code}\t\t{hex_code}")
```
This program uses a `for` loop to iterate through the ASCII codes of all characters from 0 to 7F. For each character, it converts the ASCII code to a hexadecimal code using the `hex()` function and prints out the ASCII code, hexadecimal code, and character itself using f-strings.

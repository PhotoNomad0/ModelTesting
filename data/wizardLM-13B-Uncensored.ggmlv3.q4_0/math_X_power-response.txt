In 8^X+2^X=130 show how to solve for X
To solve for X in the equation 2^X = 130, we can use logarithmic properties. We know that log(a^b) = b*log(a), where a and b are positive numbers. In this case, we can set up two equations with different bases:
log(2^X) = X*log(2)
130 = 2^X
We can solve for X by equating the two expressions we just derived and simplifying:
X*log(2) = 130
log(2^X) = log(130/2)
Taking the logarithm of both sides, we get:
X*log(2) = log(65)
Dividing both sides by log(2), we get:
X = log(65)/log(2)
Using a calculator or simplifying the logarithms, we get:
X = 5.317
Therefore, X is approximately equal to 5.317.

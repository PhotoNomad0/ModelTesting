We know that log(a^b) = b*log(a), where a and b are positive numbers. In this case, we can set up two equations with different bases:\nlog(2^X) = X*log(2)\n130 = 2^X\nWe can solve for X by equating the two expressions we just derived and simplifying:\nX*log(2) = 130\nlog(2^X) = log(130/2)\nTaking the logarithm of both sides, we get:\nX*log(2) = log(65)\nDividing both sides by log(2), we get:\nX = log(65)/log(2)\nUsing a calculator or simplifying the logarithms, we get:\nX = 5.317\nTherefore, X is approximately equal to 5.317."}], "created": 1687260523, "id": "foobarbaz", "model": "wizardLM-13B-Uncensored.ggmlv3.q4_0", "object": "text_completion", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 227, "prompt_tokens": 32, "total_tokens": 259}, "time": "22.07"}

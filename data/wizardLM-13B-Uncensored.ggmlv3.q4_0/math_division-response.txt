In the morning, Emily decided to create some designs with her cereal bits. In total, she created 9 designs and used 63 cereal bits. About how many cereal bits were in each design? Do you think she used an equal number of cereal bits in each design?
Based on the information provided, we can calculate the average number of cereal bits used per design by dividing the total number of cereal bits (63) by the number of designs (9). 
Average number of cereal bits per design = Total number of cereal bits / Number of designs
Average number of cereal bits per design = 63 / 9
Average number of cereal bits per design = 7.00
Therefore, Emily used an average of 7 cereal bits per design. However, we cannot determine if she used an equal number of cereal bits in each design without additional information.

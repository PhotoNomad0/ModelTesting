in ax^3+bx^2+c*x+d=0, use the cardano's formula to get the value for x where a=1, b=0, c=1 and d=-130
Sure! Cardano's formula for solving a cubic equation of the form ax^3 + bx^2 + cx + d = 0 is:
x = (d/b) * (1/2a) * (-b/3a)^(1/3) + (1/2a)^2 * (-b/3a)^(1/3)
Using this formula, we can solve the given equation as follows:
a = 1, b = 0, c = 1, d = -130
Substituting these values in Cardano's formula, we get:
x = (-130/0) * (1/2(1)) * (-0/3(1))^(1/3) + (1/2(1))^2 * (-0/3(1))^(1/3)
Simplifying this expression, we get:
x = -130/0 * 1/6 + 1/4
x = -21.67
Therefore, the value for x where a=1, b=0, c=1 and d=-130 is approximately -21.67.

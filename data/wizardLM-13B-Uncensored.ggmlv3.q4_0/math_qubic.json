Cardano's formula for solving a cubic equation of the form ax^3 + bx^2 + cx + d = 0 is:\nx = (d/b) * (1/2a) * (-b/3a)^(1/3) + (1/2a)^2 * (-b/3a)^(1/3)\nUsing this formula, we can solve the given equation as follows:\na = 1, b = 0, c = 1, d = -130\nSubstituting these values in Cardano's formula, we get:\nx = (-130/0) * (1/2(1)) * (-0/3(1))^(1/3) + (1/2(1))^2 * (-0/3(1))^(1/3)\nSimplifying this expression, we get:\nx = -130/0 * 1/6 + 1/4\nx = -21.67\nTherefore, the value for x where a=1, b=0, c=1 and d=-130 is approximately -21.67."}], "created": 1687260551, "id": "foobarbaz", "model": "wizardLM-13B-Uncensored.ggmlv3.q4_0", "object": "text_completion", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 263, "prompt_tokens": 62, "total_tokens": 325}, "time": "28.59"}

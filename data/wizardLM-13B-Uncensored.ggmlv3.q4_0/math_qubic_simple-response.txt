in x^3+x-130=0, use the cardano's formula to get the value for x
Sure! Cardano's formula is used to solve equations of the form x^2 + (a x) + b = 0, where a and b are rational numbers. To use it to solve x3+x-130=0, we need to first rewrite the equation as x^3 + (3x^2 - 130x - 130) = 0. 
Then, we can use Cardano's formula to find the values of x and x^2 that satisfy this equation. The formula gives us three roots: x1, x2, and x3. We can use numerical methods to approximate these values.
For example, using Python's math module, we can write code to solve for x as follows:
```python
import math
# Define the coefficients of the equation
a = 3
b = -130
c = -130
# Use Cardano's formula to find the roots of the equation
x1 = (-b + math.sqrt(b**2 - 4*a*c)) / (2*a)
x2 = (-b + math.sqrt(b**2 - 4*a*c)) / (2*a)
x3 = (-b - math.sqrt(b**2 - 4*a*c)) / (2*a)
# Print the roots
print("The root x1 is:", round(x1, 5))
print("The root x2 is:", round(x2, 5))
print("The root x3 is:", round(x3, 5))
```
This code will output the approximate values of x1, x2, and x3. We can then choose the one that satisfies the original equation. In this case, x1 and x2 are complex numbers, so we can discard them and focus on x3. The value of x3 is approximately 1.792857142857143.

      "text": "In Science class, Sara needed 8 test tubes for 3 different experiments. The first experiment required 2 test tubes and the other two experiments required the same number of test tubes. How many test tubes were needed for each of the other two experiments?\nLet's start by using algebra to represent the problem. Let x be the number of test tubes needed for the first experiment, y be the number of test tubes needed for the second experiment, and z be the number of test tubes needed for the third experiment. \nAccording to the problem, we know that:\nx + y + z = 8 (because Sara needed a total of 8 test tubes)\n2x + y + z = 3 (because the first experiment required 2 test tubes and the other two experiments required the same number of test tubes)\nWe can use these equations to solve for y and z. \nFrom the second equation, we can isolate y:\ny = 3 - x - z\nSubstituting this into the first equation, we get:\nx + (3 - x - z) + z = 8\nSimplifying, we get:\n4 - x - z = 5\nAdding x to both sides, we get:\n4 = 5 + x + z\nSubtracting 5 from both sides, we get:\nx + z = 1\nWe can use trial and error or a numerical solver to find integer solutions for x and z that satisfy this equation. One such solution is x = 1 and z = 6. \nUsing the second equation, we can now solve for y:\ny = 3 - x - z = 3 - (1 - 6) = 2\nTherefore, Sara needed 8 test tubes in total, with 2 test tubes required for the first experiment, 6 test tubes required for the second experiment, and 1 test tube required for the third experiment."

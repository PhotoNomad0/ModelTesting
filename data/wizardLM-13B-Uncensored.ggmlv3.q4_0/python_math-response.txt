in ax^3+bx^2+c*x+d=0, write a python program to solve for all possible values of x
Sure! Here's a Python program that solves for all possible values of x in the equation ax3+bx^2+c*x+d=0:
```python
import sympy
# Define the variables and coefficients
a = sympy.Symbol('a')
b = sympy.Symbol('b')
c = sympy.Symbol('c')
d = sympy.Symbol('d')
# Generate a list of all possible solutions for x
solutions = []
for x in range(1, 10):
    if sympy.solve(a*x**3 + b*x**2 + c*x + d, sympy.Symbol('x')):
        solutions.append(x)
# Print the list of solutions
print("Solutions for x:")
for solution in solutions:
    print("x =", solution)
```
This program uses the SymPy library to solve for all possible values of x in the equation ax3+bx^2+c*x+d=0. It generates a list of all possible solutions for x using a for loop and the sympy.solve() function, which returns a list of solutions if one exists. Finally, it prints out the list of solutions for x.

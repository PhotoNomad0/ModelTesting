when I was 6, my sister was half my age. Now I am 80. How old is my sister now? Calculate this step by step.
Sure! Let's break down the problem step by step. 
When you were 6 years old, your sister was half your age. So, if you were 6, then your sister was 3 years old (since she was half your age). 
Now that you are 80 years old, your sister would be 40 years old (since she is still half your age). 
Therefore, your sister is now 40 years old.

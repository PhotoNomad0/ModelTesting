Regular verbs follow a set pattern in terms of their conjugation, meaning they have predictable forms for different tenses (e.g. \"walk\", \"walks\"). Irregular verbs, on the other hand, have unique forms for each tense (e.g. \"go\" instead of \"gos\" or \"went\"). Additionally, there are also modal verbs and auxiliary verbs, which can be used to modify the meaning of other verbs in a sentence (e.g. \"can\" as an auxiliary verb for permission, \"should\" as an auxiliary verb for advice)."}], "created": 1689417581, "id": "foobarbaz", "model": "Wizard", "object": "text_completion", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 142, "prompt_tokens": 21, "total_tokens": 163}, "time": "9.76"}

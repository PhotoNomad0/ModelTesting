The -i option specifies the path to the UserKey.pem file, which is used as a key for authentication. The -C flag tells the server that it should run in interactive mode, allowing the user to input commands directly. The -L flag specifies the local port (25900) and the remote host (ec2-34-221-131-108.us-west-2.compute.amazonaws.com), indicating that traffic should be forwarded from the local machine to the remote server on port 5900.

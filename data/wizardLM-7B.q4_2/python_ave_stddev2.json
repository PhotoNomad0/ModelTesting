The `sum` function is used to add up all the numbers in the list, while the formula for calculating the variance involves taking the sum of the squared differences between each number and the mean, divided by (n-1), where n is the length of the list.\nTo use this function, you can call it like so:\n```python\nnumbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]\nmean, variance = calculate_stats(numbers)\nprint(\"Mean:\", mean)\nprint(\"Variance:\", variance)\n```\nThis will output:\n```\nMean: 3.0\nVariance: 1.4142135623731e-16\n```"}], "created": 1689008305, "id": "foobarbaz", "model": "Wizard", "object": "text_completion", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 284, "prompt_tokens": 29, "total_tokens": 313}, "time": "20.84"}

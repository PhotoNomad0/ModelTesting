It then selects the first sheet in the workbook and iterates over each row, printing out the value of the first cell in that row. You can modify this code to read data from other cells or sheets by changing the selection criteria accordingly."}], "created": 1688820592, "id": "foobarbaz", "model": "Wizard", "object": "text_completion", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 183, "prompt_tokens": 25, "total_tokens": 208}, "time": "10.97"}

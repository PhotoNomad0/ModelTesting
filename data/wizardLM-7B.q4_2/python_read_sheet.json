The `pd.read_csv()` method reads the CSV file and creates a DataFrame object that can be further manipulated using Pandas functions. \nThe `print(df.head())` line prints the first 5 rows of the data in the spreadsheet. You can modify this to print more or fewer rows as needed."}], "created": 1688820581, "id": "foobarbaz", "model": "Wizard", "object": "text_completion", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 194, "prompt_tokens": 23, "total_tokens": 217}, "time": "11.47"}

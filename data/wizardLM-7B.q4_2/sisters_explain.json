Explain your answer\nBased on the information given, we can calculate the total number of siblings by adding up the numbers of brothers and sisters. \n- Sally has 3 brothers (from her perspective)\n- Her brothers have 2 sisters (from their perspective)\nTo find out how many sisters Sally actually has, we need to look at it from a different perspective - that of the siblings themselves. Each brother and each sister has one another as a sibling, so:\nSally's brothers + Sally's sisters = 3 (number of brothers) + ? (number of sisters)\nWe don't know how many sisters her brothers have or vice versa, but we do know that the total number of siblings is 6 (3 brothers and 2 sisters each). Therefore:\nSally's brothers + Sally's sisters = 3 + ?\nTo find out how many sisters Sally actually has, we need to assign a value to the variable \"?\" based on the information given. Since we don't know how many sisters her brothers have or vice versa, we can assume that each sibling has an equal number of brothers and sisters (i.e., if one brother has 2 sisters, then Sally must also have 2 sisters). Therefore:\nSally's brothers + Sally's sisters = 3 + ?\nSince each sibling has an equal number of brothers and sisters, we can assign a value to the variable \"?\" based on the total number of siblings:\n? = (total number of siblings - 3) / 2\nWe know that there are 6 siblings in total (from the previous step), so:\n? = (6 - 3) / 2 = 1\nTherefore, Sally has 1 sister."}], "created": 1689415156, "id": "foobarbaz", "model": "Wizard", "object": "text_completion", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 397, "prompt_tokens": 41, "total_tokens": 438}, "time": "39.21"}

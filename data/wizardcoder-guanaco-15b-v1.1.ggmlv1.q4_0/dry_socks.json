The socks are now wet from the wash, so Tom hangs the 10 pairs of socks outside to dry. 10 hours later, he comes back outside to check on the socks. He feels each sock and notices they are all dry. He takes them back inside because they are all dry. How long will it take Tom to dry seven pairs of socks presuming the same weather conditions?\nTom washed 7 pairs of socks this morning, but he didn't hang them outside for a clean finish as his clothes were too heavy and would make him look uncomfortable. Instead, he left them in their dryer at home. \n\nAfter an hour, he returned to check on the seven pairs of socks - they looked even worse than before! He immediately hung them up outside for a clean finish as his clothes were still too heavy and would make him look uncomfortable. This time, it took 12 hours for Tom's seven pairs of dry socks to drip down from the warm sun that night into the clear blue sky."}], "created": 1691502076, "id": "foobarbaz", "model": "ggml-wizardcoder-guanaco-15b-v1.1.ggmlv1.q4_0.bin", "object": "text_completion", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 140, "prompt_tokens": 109, "total_tokens": 249}, "time": "37.86"}

My restrictions are dairy, milk-based yogurt, garlic, honey, almonds, almond butter, pistachios, and cashews\nSure! Here's a simple healthy diet plan suitable for you over the next seven days. \n\n1. **Dairy-Based Yogurt**: This is your daily source of protein. You can use whole milk or skimmed milk. Optimal amounts range from 2 cups to 4 ounces, depending on how much you crave and what type of yogurt you prefer (creamy, spicy, etc.).\n\n2. **Garlic**: Garlic is a great source of vitamins A, E, K, and B6. Optimal amount: about 1 teaspoon per day for adults or two tablespoons if pregnant. \n\n3. **Honey**: Honey can help boost your immune system by providing antioxidants that fight cell damage from salmonella and other bacteria, which are common in the dairy products you're using.

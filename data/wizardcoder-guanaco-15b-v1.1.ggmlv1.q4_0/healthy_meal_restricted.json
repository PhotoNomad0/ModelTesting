I can't have dairy, garlic, honey, almonds, pistachios, or cashews\nSure, here's an example of a simple and nutritious diet that should work well with your allergy needs: \n\n1. Choose lean meats such as beef stew, chicken stir-fry, pork belly, tofu or even vegetarian options like steak, salmon etc.  These are low in carbohydrates and high in protein which is essential for a balanced diet.\n2. Eat regular portions of fruits such as apples, bananas, oranges, grapes, avocados or berries from local stores if possible to avoid processed junk food that can cause allergies.  These are rich in vitamins and minerals like iron, zinc, potassium etc., which are necessary for a healthy immune system.\n3. Include whole grains such as oats, barley or rye. They're low in calories but high in fiber, protein, and omega-3 fatty acids that can help with allergy symptoms like eczema.  Avoid processed junk foods which contain added sugars and other unhealthy ingredients.\n4. Drink plenty of water throughout the day to keep you hydrated and prevent dehydration from drinks, bottles or cups. \n5. Incorporate a balanced diet with fruits such as blueberries for an allergy-friendly skin type.  Avoid eating raw olive oil which can cause eczema in people with dermatologic conditions like Raynaud's disease and sunburn.\n6. For those who have sensitive skin, consider using a gel mask to help reduce the amount of UVA/UVB light emitted by your eyes that could potentially irritate you if it gets too bright or is reflected off a reflective surface in front of you. \n7. Finally, ensure that all foods are free from cross-contamination with other ingredients and meats to avoid any potential issues related to dietary hygiene.\n\nRemember: Allergy season can be stressful for everyone involved so it's important to take your time planning a healthy eating plan."}], "created": 1691521274, "id": "foobarbaz", "model": "ggml-wizardcoder-guanaco-15b-v1.1.ggmlv1.q4_0.bin", "object": "text_completion", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 464, "prompt_tokens": 54, "total_tokens": 518}, "time": "99.68"}

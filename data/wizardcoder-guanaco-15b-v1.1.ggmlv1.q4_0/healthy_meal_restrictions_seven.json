My restrictions are dairy, garlic, honey, almonds, pistachios, and cashews\nSure! Here's an example of a simple, yet effective dietary plan that can help you stay healthy during the coming week or seven days. \n\n1. **Dairy-Free Milk** - Opt for whole milk products made with unprocessed cow\u2019s milk and soya beans instead of dairy. This includes all types of milks, including skimmed (fat-free) and non-skimmed versions.\n\n2. **Garlic & Onions** \u2013 Use organic garlic for its health benefits like anti-inflammatory properties as well as the freshness factor that it brings in. For onions, opt for plantains or legumes (beans), which are high in protein and healthy fats such as linoleic acid and total polyunsaturated fatty acids.\n\n3. **Honey** \u2013 Opt for non-dairy honey products like olive oil honey, almond butter honey, or tofu honey that is free of dairy ingredients. \n\n4. **Almonds & Pistachios** - These are great source of fiber and healthy fats. Use organic versions whenever possible as they contain natural antioxidants like fluoride for better skin health, vitamin E to boost immunity, and anti-inflammatory properties.\n\n5. **Cashews & Sesame Seeds** - These are great for digestion but also offer a source of protein that can help with weight loss or muscle growth. Opt for organic products whenever possible as they contain natural antioxidants and anti-inflammatory properties. \n\n6. **Salt, Spices & Vinegar** - These are necessary ingredients in almost any diet but should be used in moderation to avoid overpowering your body with too much salt or spice. Opt for organic foods when possible as they contain anti-inflammatory properties and can help prevent diseases like eczema, dermatitis etc.\n\n7. **Avoid Junk Food & Sugars** - These are high in sugar and fat content which is not good for your health. Opt instead for whole grains or legumes (beans) that offer a balanced intake of proteins, carbs, fats without the added sweetness from junk foods.\n\nRemember to consult with a dietitian or nutritionist who can advise you on any additional restrictions and potential health concerns based on your specific situation."}], "created": 1691521709, "id": "foobarbaz", "model": "ggml-wizardcoder-guanaco-15b-v1.1.ggmlv1.q4_0.bin", "object": "text_completion", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 543, "prompt_tokens": 54, "total_tokens": 597}, "time": "116.76"}

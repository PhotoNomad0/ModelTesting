This will output all ASCII characters from 0x00 (NUL) up to 0x7F (DEL), along with their corresponding Unicode point in hexadecimal format. \n\n```javascript\n// Loop through the range and print each character/code pair\nfor(var i=0;i<128;++i){\n   // Convert decimal to string then pad left with zeroes if needed \n   var code = (\"0\" + i.toString(16)).slice(-2);\n\n   // Print out both ASCII characters (in Unicode form) and their codes in hex format\n   console.log(\"Character: \" + String.fromCharCode(i));\n   console.log(\"Hex Code  : #\"+code+\"\\n\");\n}\n```\nWhen you run this code, it will generate a list of all printable ASCII characters from the NUL to DEL range along with their corresponding Unicode point in hexadecimal format. \n\nPlease note that JavaScript uses Unicode as its default character set and does not have separate codes for control or non-printable characters like CR (0x0D), LF (0x0A) etc., but these are considered printable ASCII characters, so they will be included when you run this script."}], "created": 1691500682, "id": "foobarbaz", "model": "ggml-wizardcoder-guanaco-15b-v1.1.ggmlv1.q4_0.bin", "object": "text_completion", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 271, "prompt_tokens": 31, "total_tokens": 302}, "time": "55.63"}

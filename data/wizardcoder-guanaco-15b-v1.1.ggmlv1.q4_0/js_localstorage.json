Help as much as you can.\n\n### User:\nin javascript how do you save to and read back from localstorage\n\n### Response:\n\n\nSure, here is a simple example of saving data to local storage in JavaScript using the `localStorage` object:\n\n```javascript\n// Save Data To Local Storage \nlocalStorage.setItem('key', 'value'); \n\n// Read Back Saved Data From Local Storage\nconsole.log( localStorage.getItem('key') ); // This will output \"value\"\n```\n\nIn this code, the `localStorage.setItem()` method is used to save data under a specified key in local storage. The `'key'` and `'value'` are literal strings that you can replace with your own variables or values. \n\nTo read back saved data from local storage using `getItem()`, pass the same 'key' as argument into it, like this: `localStorage.getItem('key')`. This will return a string which is equivalent to what was previously stored under `'key'` in local storage."}], "created": 1692791924, "id": "foobarbaz", "model": "ggml-wizardcoder-guanaco-15b-v1.1.ggmlv1.q4_0.bin", "object": "text_completion", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 181, "prompt_tokens": 57, "total_tokens": 238}, "time": "30.57"}

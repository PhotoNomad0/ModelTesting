Help as much as you can.\n\n### User:\ncreate a javascript function that uses regex to extract a three character code like \"1Jn\" from a filename in format \"57-1Jn.usfm\".  The characters can be upper or lower case letters or digits. And the filename extension must be \".usfm\".\n\n### Response:\n\n\nSure, I'd be happy to help you with that! Here's a JavaScript function using regular expressions (regex) which should meet your requirements: \n\n```javascript\nfunction extractThreeCharCode(filename){\n    // The regex pattern for the filename format \"57-1Jn.usfm\" \n    var pattern = /^(\\d{2})[-]([a-zA-Z0-9]{3}).*\\.usfm$/;\n\n    if (pattern.test(filename)) {\n        return RegExp.$2;  // This will give you '1Jn'\n    } else {\n        return null;   // If the pattern doesn't match, returns NULL \n    }\n}\n```\nThis function uses a regular expression to test whether `filename` matches the format \"57-1Jn.usfm\". The regex pattern `/^(\\d{2})[-]([a-zA-Z0-9]{3}).*\\.usfm$/` is used for this: \n\n- `^`: Matches the start of a line \n- `\\d{2}`: matches any two digits (the book chapter number)\n- `-`: Matches the '-' character that separates the chapter and three characters code.\n- `[a-zA-Z0-9]{3}`: matches any combination of upper or lower case letters, or digits exactly 3 times for a Three Character Code(Three Characters are [a-z],[A-Z] & [0-9])\n- `.*`: Matches any character zero or more times (for the rest part) except newline. The .* can include spaces and tabs if they exist in your filename, as long as there is at least one of them after '3' characters code. \n- `\\.` : matches '.' character which separates extension from file name.\n- `usfm`: Matches string \"usfm\" for the usfm format (case insensitive). \n\nIf this pattern exists in your filename, `$2` is set to three characters after '-' and function returns '1Jn'. If it doesn't match or if there are less than 3 digits before '-', then NULL will be returned. Please note that JavaScript RegEx engine treats `\\d{2}` as a digit character class (not an escape sequence)."}], "created": 1693336584, "id": "foobarbaz", "model": "ggml-wizardcoder-guanaco-15b-v1.1.ggmlv1.q4_0.bin", "object": "text_completion", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 477, "prompt_tokens": 101, "total_tokens": 578}, "time": "88.45"}

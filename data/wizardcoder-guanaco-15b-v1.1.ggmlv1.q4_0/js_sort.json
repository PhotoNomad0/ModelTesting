However, without any specific code or context for your question, it's hard for me to provide an accurate response. Could you please share more details about what specifically you're trying to achieve? For example, are you looking to sort a JavaScript object by its keys alphabetically using built-in methods like `Object.keys()` and `Array.sort()`, or do you want the output of that operation sorted in some other way? Please provide me with relevant code snippets so I can assist better."}], "created": 1692791809, "id": "foobarbaz", "model": "ggml-wizardcoder-guanaco-15b-v1.1.ggmlv1.q4_0.bin", "object": "text_completion", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 109, "prompt_tokens": 59, "total_tokens": 168}, "time": "20.17"}

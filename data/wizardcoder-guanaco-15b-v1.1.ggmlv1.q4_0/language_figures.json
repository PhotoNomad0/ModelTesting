Here is a brief explanation for each category:\n1) Sayings (Verbs): These include sentences that express thoughts or feelings rather than asking questions about them. They can be subjective to individual personal tastes because they are based on the speaker's interpretation of their own context. Examples could include \"I love you\", \"You're welcome\" and so forth.\n2) Questions (Verbs): These figures of speech ask for information or opinions, usually in a polite way. They can be direct like 'Do you know?' or indirect such as 'What do you want to talk about today?'. The key is that the questioner does not necessarily have to agree with what they are being asked but rather provides something new and interesting to consider.\n3) Commands (Verbs): These figures of speech express desires, wishes, or instructions in a formal way. They can be imperative like 'Clean up your room' or declarative such as 'I am tired'. The key is that the commander has complete control over what happens and does not have to agree with anything they're being told because it's just an instruction given without any judgement.\n4) Explanation (Verbs): These figures of speech explain something in a way that can be understood by others who do not possess the original words or context, such as 'The sun rises'. The key is to provide information about what was being explained and how it fits into the larger picture without giving any opinion."}], "created": 1691521981, "id": "foobarbaz", "model": "ggml-wizardcoder-guanaco-15b-v1.1.ggmlv1.q4_0.bin", "object": "text_completion", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 333, "prompt_tokens": 22, "total_tokens": 355}, "time": "65.37"}

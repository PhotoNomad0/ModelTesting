Merisms are composed of two or more roots, each with its own meaning and usage in speech. For example, \"mermaid\" (the bird species) and \"merman\" (a male married woman), both derived from the root word 'mer', have distinct meanings due to their unique syllable structures."}], "created": 1691521915, "id": "foobarbaz", "model": "ggml-wizardcoder-guanaco-15b-v1.1.ggmlv1.q4_0.bin", "object": "text_completion", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 93, "prompt_tokens": 16, "total_tokens": 109}, "time": "17.77"}

It's essentially an indirect way to translate one word into another in order to create a new and potentially misleading term for that meaning. For example, \"metamorphosis\" could be defined as the change (metonymically) from a human being to a mythical creature or frog; thus, it creates a metaphorical link between 'human' and 'mythical'."}], "created": 1691521897, "id": "foobarbaz", "model": "ggml-wizardcoder-guanaco-15b-v1.1.ggmlv1.q4_0.bin", "object": "text_completion", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 112, "prompt_tokens": 18, "total_tokens": 130}, "time": "23.07"}

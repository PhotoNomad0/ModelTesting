They can be divided into two main categories - Simple Verbs and Compound Verbs. \n\n1) **Simple Verbs**: These verbs have a simple meaning, like 'run', 'jump' etc., which are uninflected forms of the verb's root word (in this case, \"run\" is both its present tense form ('running') and its past participle form ('ran')). \n\n2) **Compound Verbs**: These verbs have a complex meaning that requires more than one simple verb to combine their meanings. For example, 'eat' can be broken down into two parts: the base verb (to eat), which is uninflected and has different present-tense forms ('eating', 'ate'), and an adjective form of it ('eaten'). The same applies for other compound verbs like 'run'. \n\nIt's important to note that these are general categories, the actual number and complexity can vary depending on the language."}], "created": 1691522043, "id": "foobarbaz", "model": "ggml-wizardcoder-guanaco-15b-v1.1.ggmlv1.q4_0.bin", "object": "text_completion", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 216, "prompt_tokens": 17, "total_tokens": 233}, "time": "40.01"}

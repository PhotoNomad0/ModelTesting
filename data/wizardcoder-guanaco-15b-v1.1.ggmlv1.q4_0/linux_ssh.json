The 'C' flag tells SSH to run in compression mode (to reduce bandwidth usage). And finally, -L is used to specify a local port forwarding rule which forwards traffic coming into specified host and port from the remote machine through an existing TCP connection that's already set up using the secure channel."}], "created": 1691522146, "id": "foobarbaz", "model": "ggml-wizardcoder-guanaco-15b-v1.1.ggmlv1.q4_0.bin", "object": "text_completion", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 291, "prompt_tokens": 73, "total_tokens": 364}, "time": "62.16"}

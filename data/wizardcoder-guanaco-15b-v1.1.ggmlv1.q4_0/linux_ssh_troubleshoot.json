{"choices": [{"finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0, "logprobs": null, "references": [], "text": "why does this command give error Permission denied (publickey):\n\nssh -i \\\u201c~/UserKey.pem\" -C -L 25900:localhost:5900 ec2-34-221-131-108.us-west-2.compute.amazonaws.com\nThe command you provided is an SSH (Secure Shell) command, which allows remote access to a Linux system over the internet. The error \"Permission denied (publickey)\" usually means that your public key on your local machine does not match with what's configured in the EC2 instance for password-less authentication. \n\nHere are some steps you can take:\n1. Firstly, make sure that both your private and public keys exist at the specified location (\\\u201c~/UserKey.pem). If they don't exist or have been moved somewhere else since then, generate them again using 'ssh-keygen' command in a terminal (you might need to provide passphrase if you've set one for previous key generation):\n```bash\n$ ssh-keygen -t rsa  # press enter when prompted twice\n```\n   This will create two files: private and public keys. The default name of the private key is id_rsa, while the default location of the public key is ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub (you can change these names if you want).\n   \n2. Next step would be to copy your local public key onto EC2 instance using 'scp' command:\n   ```bash\n   $ scp ~/UserKey.pem ec2-user@ec2-34-221-131-108.us-west-2.compute.amazonaws.com:~\n   # replace \"ec2-user\" with your username if it's different on the instance\n    ```\n3. Now, you need to add this public key onto EC2 server as a trusted one:\n\n   Connecting over SSH (Secure Shell):\n   \n   ```bash\n   $ ssh -i ~/UserKey.pem ec2-user@ec2-34-221-131-108.us-west-2.compute.amazonaws.com\n    # replace \"ec2-user\" with your username if it's different on the instance\n   \n   ```\n   Once you're connected, add this public key to authorized_keys file:\n\n   ```bash\n   $ sudo su  # switch user as root (sudo)\n   $ mkdir .ssh && chmod go700 .ssh   # create directory and set permissions\n   \n \u00a0$ cat ~/UserKey.pem.pub >> ~/.ssh/authorized_keys    # append public key to authorized keys file\n   \n   $ exit     # log out from the instance, back at your local machine\n   ```\n4. Finally, test if you can now connect without entering a password:\n\n   Connecting over SSH (Secure Shell):\n   \n \u00a0```bash\n   ssh -i ~/UserKey.pem ec2-user@ec2-34-221-131-108.us-west-2.compute.amazonaws.com\n   \n   ```\nIf this still doesn't work, it could be that the permissions on your private key are incorrect or something else is wrong with SSH configuration and you might need to check these settings again (for example in ~/.ssh/config file)."}], "created": 1691522295, "id": "foobarbaz", "model": "ggml-wizardcoder-guanaco-15b-v1.1.ggmlv1.q4_0.bin", "object": "text_completion", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 630, "prompt_tokens": 84, "total_tokens": 714}, "time": "148.98"}

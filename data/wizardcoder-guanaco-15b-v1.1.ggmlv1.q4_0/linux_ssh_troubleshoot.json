Help as much as you can.\n\n### User:\nwhy does this command give error Permission denied (publickey):\n\nssh -i \"~/UserKey.pem\" -C -L 25900:localhost:5900 ec2-34-221-131-108.us-west-2.compute.amazonaws.com\n\n### Response:\n\n\nThe command you provided seems to be a combination of two operations, the use of SSH for secure remote login and then forwarding your local port (25900) through which you are connecting with VNC Viewer at localhost on EC2 instance 172.16.31.108.\n\nThe error \"Permission denied(publickey)\" usually means that the private key file provided (-i \"~/UserKey.pem\") is not correct or does not allow access to the remote server where your VNC session should be established (ec2-34-221-131-108.us-west-2.compute.amazonaws.com).\n\nThe steps you need to follow are:\n\n1) First, verify if the private key file is correct by using ssh-keygen command with no arguments which will generate a new public/private pair of keys in OpenSSH format and save them into ~/.ssh directory (if it doesn't exist already):\n\n   ```\n   $ cd ~ \n   $ ls -a  # list all files & directories including hidden ones.\n    . .. .bash_logout .bashrc .profile UserKey.pem   <--- This is the private key file provided\n   \n   $ ssh-keygen   \n   Generating public/private rsa key pair.\n   Enter file in which to save the public key (/home/ec2-user/.ssh/id_rsa.pub): \n   Key saved in /home/ec2-user/.ssh/id_rsa.pub.\n   \n2) Next, copy this generated public key into your clipboard using xclip command:\n\n   ```\n   $ sudo apt install xclip    # Install the X11 system clipbord utility if it's not installed already\n   \n   $ xclip -sel clip < ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub   # Copy contents of id_rsa.pub file to clipboard\n   \n3) Now, log into your EC2 instance using SSH and verify that you can connect without a password:\n\n   ```\n   ssh -i \"~/UserKey.pem\" ec2-34-221-131-108.us-west-2.compute.amazonaws.com\n   \n   The authenticity of host 'ec2-34-221-131-108.us-west-2.compute.amazonaws.com (172.16.58.3)' can't be established.\n   ECDSA key fingerprint is SHA256:aK/yJ9j+vOqL4sN0gXwT7eYbB9tQZfS9zV8kF9lW1c.\n   \n4) If you can connect without a password, then the private key file is correct and it allows access to EC2 instance where VNC session will be established:\n\n   ```\n   $ ssh -i \"~/UserKey.pem\" ec2-34-221-131-108.us-west-2.compute.amazonaws.com\n   \n   The authenticity of host 'ec2-34-221-131-108.us-west-2.compute.amazonaws.com (172.16.58.3)' can't be established.\n   ECDSA key fingerprint is SHA256:aK/yJ9j+vOqL4sN0gXwT7eYbB9tQZfS9zV8kF9lW1c.\n   \n   Are you sure you want to continue connecting (yes/no/[fingerprint])? yes\n   \n5) Forward your local port 25900 through which VNC Viewer is connected with EC2 instance using SSH:\n\n   ```\n   ssh -i \"~/UserKey.pem\" -C -L 25900:localhost:5900 ec2-34-221-131-108.us-west-2.compute.amazonaws.com\n   \n   If you are sure that this is what you want, proceed (y/n)? y\n   \n6) Check if the port forwarding has been set up correctly:\n\n   ```\n   $ ssh -i \"~/UserKey.pem\" ec2-34-221-131-108.us-west-2.compute.amazonaws.com\n   \n   Now, you can connect to localhost on your local machine using VNC Viewer at port 25900 and it will be connected with EC2 instance where the desktop is being displayed\n   \nPlease note that this process assumes that:\n   - You have a valid private key file for SSH access into ec2-34-221-131-108.us-west-2.compute.amazonaws.com, and \n   - The VNC server on EC2 instance is running with passwordless authentication enabled (equivalent to setting up publickey authentication in OpenSSH).\n   \nIf these assumptions are not met or if the process fails for any reason, you may need to perform additional troubleshooting steps according to your specific setup."}], "created": 1692791729, "id": "foobarbaz", "model": "ggml-wizardcoder-guanaco-15b-v1.1.ggmlv1.q4_0.bin", "object": "text_completion", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 1084, "prompt_tokens": 114, "total_tokens": 1198}, "time": "229.02"}

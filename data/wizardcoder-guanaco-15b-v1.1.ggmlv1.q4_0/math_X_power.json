In order to solve it, we can convert it into a standard form by using the method of factoring or expanding. \n\nFirstly, let's try converting it into its expanded form. We have 8^X+2^X=130 which when raised to power X equals 130*2^(log(8, 2)+log(2, 2)). Expanding this gives us:\n\n8^X + 4^X = 650 \n\nSo now we have two equations in terms of the same variable. We can solve for one and substitute it into the other to find X. Let's start by solving equation 1 for X:\n\n2^(log(8, 2)+log(2, 2))=650/4 \n\nThis simplifies to:\n\n3^X = 175 (approximately)\n\nNow we can substitute this value of X into the original equation and solve it. Let's rewrite our equation as follows:\n\n8^(X+log(2, 8)) + 2^(X)=130 \n\nNext, let's factor out logarithms from both sides:\n\ne^X*(8*X) + e^X*2 = 650/4 * (e^X)^-1\n\nThis simplifies to:\n\n72*X+4=90.375 \n\nNow, let's solve this equation for X using the method of factoring or expanding again as needed."}], "created": 1691500821, "id": "foobarbaz", "model": "ggml-wizardcoder-guanaco-15b-v1.1.ggmlv1.q4_0.bin", "object": "text_completion", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 342, "prompt_tokens": 28, "total_tokens": 370}, "time": "67.33"}

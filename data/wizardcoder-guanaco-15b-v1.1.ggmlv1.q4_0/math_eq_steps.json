First, we need to perform the operation in parentheses on both sides of the equation: \n   (25 - 4) * 2 + 3\n   Simplifying this gives us: \n   \n   21 * 2 + 3\n   \n2. Now that all numbers outside of parenthesis have been resolved, let's move down to multiplying and adding:\n\n   21 * 2 = 42\n   \n   Adding 3 to the end gives us:\n   \n   42 + 3 \n   \n   So our equation becomes:\n   \n   42 + 3 = ?"}], "created": 1691500862, "id": "foobarbaz", "model": "ggml-wizardcoder-guanaco-15b-v1.1.ggmlv1.q4_0.bin", "object": "text_completion", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 127, "prompt_tokens": 27, "total_tokens": 154}, "time": "25.74"}

This involves factoring out 'a' and squaring both sides of the equation to eliminate 'b'. The original equation becomes ax^3+bx^2+c*x+d=0, which can be rearranged as (ax + b)^2 - c * x = d or a(x\u00b2) + 2b*x + c = d.\n\nStep 2: Rewrite the quadratic form in terms of t using the following formula: f(t) = [At\u00b3 + Bt\u00b2 - C] / D, where A \u2260 0 and |B| < 1/4D^(-1). \n\nSubstituting a=1, b=0, c=-130 into this equation gives us t = [-c \u00b1 \u221a[c\u00b2-4ac(d + C)] / (2a)].\n\nStep 3: The value of x is then given by the formula f(t) \u2248 [At\u00b3 - Bt\u00b2] * [(1/\u221a[(C+D*t)^2 - 8CD]) \u00b1 i \u221a[(C-D*t)^2 - 8CD]] / (Dt).\n\nHowever, since we are given that a=1 and b=0 but |B| < 1/4(d^(-1)) which is not zero. This means the equation has complex roots in the interval [-\u221a36, +\u221a36]. \n\nTherefore, using Cardano's formula cannot be used directly to find x-values for this equation since it involves square root operations on non-zero real numbers that are outside of our given range (-\u221a36 \u2264 t \u2264 \u221a36)."}], "created": 1691501020, "id": "foobarbaz", "model": "ggml-wizardcoder-guanaco-15b-v1.1.ggmlv1.q4_0.bin", "object": "text_completion", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 423, "prompt_tokens": 57, "total_tokens": 480}, "time": "89.50"}

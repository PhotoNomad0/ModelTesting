It can be used when you only need one root or even both roots in terms of real numbers. However, it does not work with complex numbers because they are irrational and do not satisfy the requirements needed to use this formula. \n\nHowever, if your equation has integer coefficients (i.e., no fractions), then you can apply Cardano's Formula without worrying about whether your solution will be rational or irrational:\n\nStep 1: Rewrite the equation in terms of a power-three polynomial by factoring out x^3. Let's start with rearranging and combining like terms: \n\n(x^3 + (-130))(x - 1) = (x^4)(x^2 - 130).\n\nStep 2: Now, use the formula for cubic roots to find one of two possible solutions. Let's assume we want the positive root since it is closer to x=1 than negative root which has a larger absolute value. \n\nUsing this information and substituting our values into the Cardano's Formula, you get:\n\n(x^4)(x^2 - 130) = (a + b*C)*(c*(D-E)+F)^(-1), where A=-b/2a is a real number. \n\nStep 3: Solve this equation for one of the roots using Cardano's Formula and your knowledge about cubic equations."}], "created": 1691501083, "id": "foobarbaz", "model": "ggml-wizardcoder-guanaco-15b-v1.1.ggmlv1.q4_0.bin", "object": "text_completion", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 313, "prompt_tokens": 35, "total_tokens": 348}, "time": "63.53"}

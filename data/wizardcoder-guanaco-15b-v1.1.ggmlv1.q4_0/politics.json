They tend to support policies that prioritize wealth for the majority while opposing those of the minority group in favor of economic growth and social justice. On the other hand, Libertarians and Radicals advocate for liberty as a fundamental right, emphasizing individual rights over collective ones. The issue is that they represent a split within societies rather than opposing each other's views on issues like economics or politics."}], "created": 1691500913, "id": "foobarbaz", "model": "ggml-wizardcoder-guanaco-15b-v1.1.ggmlv1.q4_0.bin", "object": "text_completion", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 117, "prompt_tokens": 33, "total_tokens": 150}, "time": "25.95"}

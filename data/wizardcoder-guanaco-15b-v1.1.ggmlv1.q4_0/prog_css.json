Help as much as you can.\n\n### User:\nHow do you align a row of divs to the right using flex in css?  Show me an example.\n\n### Response:\n\n\nFlexbox is used for layout, and it's one of CSS\u2019s powerful tools that allows us to control how items are laid out on a page. Here is a simple example of aligning a row of div elements (divs) to the right using flex in CSS:\n\nHTML Code:\n```html\n<div class=\"container\">\n  <div>1</div>\n  <div>2</div>\n  <div>3</div>\n</div>\n```\nCSS Code:\n```css\n.container {\n  display:flex; /* Enable flexbox for the parent container */\n\n  justify-content: space-between; /* Align items horizontally, with even gutter width between each item  */\n  \n  align-items: center; /* Center content vertically within the parent element */\n  \n} \n\n/* Style child elements (divs) */\n.container > div {\n  background-color: #ddd;\n\n  font-size: 30px;\n\n  padding:15px; \n\n  border:2px solid black;\n  \n  flex: auto; /* Expand items to fill available space, even if they are smaller than their container */\n  \n}\n```\nIn this example, the `justify-content` property is set to \"space-between\", which aligns div elements side by side with equal spacing between them. The `align-items` property is set to center, which centers all items vertically within its parent element (div). \n\nThe flex value of 'auto' in each child div tells the browser that it should be as wide or tall as possible inside the flexible container. This means any space left after distributing available space among other elements will just take up empty space, which is exactly what you're looking for!"}], "created": 1692791788, "id": "foobarbaz", "model": "ggml-wizardcoder-guanaco-15b-v1.1.ggmlv1.q4_0.bin", "object": "text_completion", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 369, "prompt_tokens": 66, "total_tokens": 435}, "time": "59.26"}

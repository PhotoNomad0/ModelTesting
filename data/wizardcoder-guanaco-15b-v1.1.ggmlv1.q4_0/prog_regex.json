Help as much as you can.\n\n### User:\ncreate a regex expression to extract a three character code like \"1Jn\" from a filename in format \"57-1Jn.usfm\".  The characters can be upper or lower case letters or digits. And the filename extension must be \".usfm\".\n\n### Response:\n\n\nSure, I'd be happy to help you with that! A regex expression (RegEx) is a sequence of characters that define a search pattern. Here's how it would work for your requirements:\n\n```regex\n^[0-9]{2}-[a-zA-Z]{3}\\.[us][sf][fm]$\n```\n\nHere are the parts of this regex expression:\n\n1. `^` - This indicates that the line starts with a specific sequence, in this case it's \"^\". \n\n2. `[0-9]{2}-[a-zA-Z]{3}`\n   * `[0-9]` - Matches any digit from 0 to 9. \n   * `{2}`   - Specifies exactly two occurrences of the previous character or group. \n   \n   `-`\n   \n   * `[a-zA-Z]{3}`\n     * `a-zA-Z` matches any letter (both uppercase and lowercase). \n     * `{3}`    specifies that there are exactly three of these characters following this one.\n\n`.[us][sf][fm]`\n  This part checks for the file extension \".usf\". \n\n`$` - The `$` sign at the end indicates that a line should end with the specified sequence, in our case it's \"$\", which means there can be no more characters after these specifications on this one-line string."}], "created": 1693336496, "id": "foobarbaz", "model": "ggml-wizardcoder-guanaco-15b-v1.1.ggmlv1.q4_0.bin", "object": "text_completion", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 288, "prompt_tokens": 98, "total_tokens": 386}, "time": "55.60"}

Here's an example code snippet using these methods:\n\n```python\nimport statistics \n\n# Define your number list here \nnumbers = [10,20,30,40,50]\n\n# Calculate average (mean) of numbers\naverage = sum(numbers)/len(numbers)\nprint(\"Average:\", round(average)) # You can use 'round' function to round the result if needed. \n\n# Calculate standard deviation \nstd_deviation = statistics.stdev(numbers)\nprint(\"Standard Deviation:\", std_deviation)\n```\nIn this code, we first import the `statistics` module which contains functions for calculating mathematical statistics of a data set like mean and variance in Python. Then define your list of numbers. The average is calculated using the built-in function `sum()` and length of number list (`len()`) divided by total count then it's printed with 'round' to get only two decimal places, followed by \"Average:\" prompt. Similarly standard deviation is calculated using statistics module method stdev(). It prints as \"Standard Deviation:\".\n\nPlease note that these functions will work for a sequence of numbers and not for other data types like strings or complex numbers etc., if you want to calculate those statistical values, then need to convert the list into numerical type first."}], "created": 1691501968, "id": "foobarbaz", "model": "ggml-wizardcoder-guanaco-15b-v1.1.ggmlv1.q4_0.bin", "object": "text_completion", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 307, "prompt_tokens": 22, "total_tokens": 329}, "time": "69.93"}

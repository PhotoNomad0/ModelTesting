This code snippet will take in a list of numbers as input, calculates their mean (average) and standard deviation, then returns these two values. Please note that this function assumes the given list contains real numbers only. If there are also non-numeric elements present in your list, you might want to handle those separately or first filter out them using a condition:\n\n```python\nimport statistics as stats  # import required module\n\ndef calculate_average_std(num_list):\n    if not num_list:\n        return \"List is empty\"\n\n    try: \n        mean = sum(num_list) / len(num_list)  \n        std_deviation = stats.stdev(num_list)  # standard deviation function\n\n        return round(mean,2),round(std_deviation,2)\n    except ZeroDivisionError as e:\n        print(\"Error:\",e)\n```\nYou can use this function by passing a list of numbers to it like so: `average, std = calculate_average_std([1.0, 2.5, 3.7])`. This will return the average and standard deviation for `[1.0, 2.5, 3.7]`.\nPlease note that in Python, you need to import a module (in this case `statistics`) before using its functions or constants. Also remember that if your list contains non-numeric elements like strings, booleans etc., the function will raise an exception and return \"List is empty\"."}], "created": 1691502038, "id": "foobarbaz", "model": "ggml-wizardcoder-guanaco-15b-v1.1.ggmlv1.q4_0.bin", "object": "text_completion", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 328, "prompt_tokens": 25, "total_tokens": 353}, "time": "69.87"}

Here is an example Python code that solves the quadratic equation in terms of real numbers. This script uses built-in libraries from NumPy and SciPy which perform much more complex mathematical operations than simple algebraic calculations using only standard math module. \n\n```python\nimport numpy as np  # for numerical computations\nfrom scipy import optimize  # to solve equations\n\ndef main():\n    a, b, c = -10., 4., 3.   # coefficients of the quadratic equation\n\n    # Finding real solutions using built-in functions in NumPy and SciPy libraries: \n    x_soln = np.roots([a,b,c]) \n\n    print(\"The roots are:\", *x_soln)\n\nif __name__ == '__main__':\n    main() \n```\nIn this code, the `np.roots()` function is used to find all real solutions of a quadratic equation in terms of complex numbers (when b^2 - 4ac is not negative). The roots are then printed out as they come with their respective multiplicities. \n\nPlease note that if your system doesn't have NumPy and SciPy installed, you can install them using pip: `pip install numpy scipy`."}], "created": 1691501234, "id": "foobarbaz", "model": "ggml-wizardcoder-guanaco-15b-v1.1.ggmlv1.q4_0.bin", "object": "text_completion", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 260, "prompt_tokens": 38, "total_tokens": 298}, "time": "56.25"}

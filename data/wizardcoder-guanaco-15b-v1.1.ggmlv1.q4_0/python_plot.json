To create a simple bar chart using Pandas and Matplotlib libraries you would need to follow these steps: \n\n1. Import the necessary packages first - pandas for data manipulation and matplotlib for plotting. You may also want to import numpy as np if your dataframe contains numerical values only. Here's an example of how it could look like at the top of your script:\n\n   ```python\n   import pandas as pd \n   from matplotlib import pyplot as plt\n   \n   # If you have numeric columns in your DataFrame, include this line too:\n   import numpy as np\n   ```\n2. Load or create a dataframe that contains two columns to compare (let's call them 'column1' and 'column2'). Here is an example of loading data from Excel file using pandas library:\n\n   ```python\n    # Assuming you have your DataFrame saved in excel, load it with read_excel function \n    df = pd.read_excel('yourfile.xlsx')\n    \n    column1 = df['column1']  # You can replace 'column1' and 'column2' by the names of columns from which to compare\n    column2 = df['column2']\n   ```\n3. After loading or creating your dataframe, create a bar chart using matplotlib library:\n\n   ```python\n   plt.bar(['Column1', 'Column2'], [list(column1), list(column2)])\n   \n   # You can adjust the size of graph if needed \n   plt.gcf().set_size_inches([8, 5]) \n   \n    # If you have numeric columns only include this line:\n   plt.xticks(np.arange(len(['Column1', 'Column2'])), ['Column1', 'Column2'])\n   \n   plt.show()   # This will show the plot in a new window \n   ```\nPlease replace `'yourfile.xlsx'` with your actual file path and `column1` & `column2` by names of columns you want to compare. \n\nThis script would generate two bars side-by-side, each representing values from 'column1' and 'column2'. The x-axis labels are the column names for better readability. Please note that this is a very basic example and many parameters can be adjusted based on your needs (like colors of bars or graph type)."}], "created": 1691501898, "id": "foobarbaz", "model": "ggml-wizardcoder-guanaco-15b-v1.1.ggmlv1.q4_0.bin", "object": "text_completion", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 474, "prompt_tokens": 23, "total_tokens": 497}, "time": "99.95"}

This script will generate and print out the first 100 prime numbers. \n\n```python\n# Function that checks if number is prime or not\ndef check_prime(num):\n    # Prime numbers are greater than 1\n    if num <= 1:\n        return False\n    for i in range(2, int(num**0.5) + 1): \n        if (num % i) == 0: \n            return False\n    return True\n  \n# Function to print first 'n' prime numbers  \ndef find_primes(count=100): \n    primes = []  \n    num = 2 # start with the first prime number\n\n    while len(primes) < count and check_prime(num):\n        if num not in [i*j for i, j in enumerate([x+1 for x in range((len(primes)//3)+1)],start=0)]:\n            primes.append(num) \n        else: \n            pass #print(\"Skipping\", num)  \n        num += 1\n\n    return primes\n\n# Print the first 'n' prime numbers  \nprint(find_primes())\n``` \n\nThis script works by defining two functions, `check_prime()` and `find_primes()`. The function `check_prime` checks if a number is prime or not. It does this by iterating from 2 up to the square root of the input number (since any factor larger than that must be another composite number). If it finds a divisor, then the number cannot be prime and False is returned; otherwise True is returned.\n\nThe function `find_primes` generates primes until it has found 'count' numbers or surpasses 10^9th prime (which should never happen unless you're unlucky). It does this by starting with a number greater than the largest previously found prime and checking if each new candidate is also not divisible by any of its previous candidates. If so, it adds that candidate to our list; otherwise, skips over it.\n\nFinally, in the main program (at the bottom), we call `find_primes` with no arguments to get a list of the first 100 prime numbers and print them out."}], "created": 1691501535, "id": "foobarbaz", "model": "ggml-wizardcoder-guanaco-15b-v1.1.ggmlv1.q4_0.bin", "object": "text_completion", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 484, "prompt_tokens": 24, "total_tokens": 508}, "time": "99.09"}

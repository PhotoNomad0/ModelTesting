We need to find how long it will take to dry another 7 pairs of socks in the same weather conditions. \n\nLet's assume that each pair of sock takes $t$ time to dry. \n\nSince we know that 10 hours later, all the socks were dry, we can use the formula for drying rate: \n$$\\text{time} = \\frac{\\text{number of socks}\\times t}{\\text{drying rate}}$$\nWhere $\\text{drying rate}$ is the time it takes to dry one pair of sock. \n\nIf we assume that each pair of sock took $t$ hours to dry, then we have: \n\n$$10 = \\frac{17\\times t}{r}$$ \nwhere $r$ is the drying rate. \n\nWe can solve for $r$:\n\n$$r = \\frac{10}{17}t$$\n\nNow, since Tom needs to dry seven more pairs of socks, we can use this formula again: \n\n$$\\text{time} = \\frac{\\text{number of socks}\\times t}{\\text{drying rate}}$$\n\nSo, the time it will take to dry 7 additional pairs of socks is: \n\n$$t\\times 7 = \\frac{7}{r}$$ \n\nSubstituting $r$ from the first formula: \n\n$$t\\times 7 = \\frac{7}{\\frac{10}{17}t}$$\n\nSimplifying, we get:\n\n$$t\\times 7\\times 17 = 7$$\n\nDividing both sides by $7$ gives us the time it will take to dry seven pairs of socks in hours:\n\n$$t=\\boxed{1.42857\\text{ hours}$$ "}, "finish_reason": "stop"}], "usage": {"prompt_tokens": 0, "completion_tokens": 508, "total_tokens": 508}, "time": "70.50"}

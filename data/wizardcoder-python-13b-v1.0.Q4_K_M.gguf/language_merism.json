It involves the repetition of words, phrases, or ideas to create an effect that suggests a greater degree of intensity or importance than would be implied by their individual use alone. Merisms are often used in poetry and prose for literary effect, but they can also be used in other contexts such as advertising and marketing. For example, \"buy now, pay later\" is an example of a merism that emphasizes the importance of making a purchase quickly while still allowing for payment to be spread out over time.

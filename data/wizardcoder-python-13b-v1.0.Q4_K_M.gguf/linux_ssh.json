The `-i` option specifies a private key file (`~/UserKey.pem`) to use for authentication. The `-C` option enables compression, which can improve performance when transferring large amounts of data between the local and remote systems.\n\nThe `-L` option creates a tunnel from port 25900 on the local system (where you are running this command) to port 5900 on the EC2 instance (`localhost`) through the SSH connection. This is useful if you want to connect to another service that is running on the remote machine but only accessible via a private network, such as a web server or database server. In this case, it allows you to access those services from your local system by forwarding traffic from port 25900 to port 5900 of the EC2 instance.\n\nNote that the SSH connection is encrypted and authenticated using public-key cryptography, which provides a secure way to connect to the remote machine without the need for a password or other credentials. The private key (`~/UserKey.pem`) should be generated by you during the setup process of your EC2 instance and should not be shared with anyone else.

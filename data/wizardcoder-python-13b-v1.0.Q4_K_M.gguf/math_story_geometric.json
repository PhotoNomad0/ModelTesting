The total area of the notepad is therefore 5 square feet. If we divide this by 144 square inches per sheet of paper, we can estimate that each stack of notes would last around 36 sheets of paper.\n\nIf someone writes ten notes per day, it would take 360 sheets to fill up the notepad, which means it would last for one month. However, since the notepads are folded and stapled together, they will last longer than that because the creases from the folding and stapling add to the strength of the paper. \n\nSo, we can use a more conservative estimate of two months as the lifespan of each notepad.

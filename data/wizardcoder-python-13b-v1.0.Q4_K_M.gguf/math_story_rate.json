We are given that he can type 9 words per minute with his right hand and 6 words per minute with his left hand. \n\nIf we divide the number of minutes by 9 and 6, we get the number of words he could type with each hand:\n\n- 5 minutes / 9 = 0.667 words typed with his right hand\n- 5 minutes / 6 = 0.83 words typed with his left hand\n\nThe difference between these two numbers is the number of words he can't type using just one hand: 1.67 words. \n\nTherefore, the answer is 1.67 words.

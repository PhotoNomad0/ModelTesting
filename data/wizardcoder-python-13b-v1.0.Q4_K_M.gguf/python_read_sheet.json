Here's a sample code that reads all the rows and columns of a sheet in a workbook:\r\n\r\n```python\r\nimport openpyxl\r\n\r\ndef read_spreadsheet(filepath):\r\n    wb = openpyxl.load_workbook(filename=filepath)\r\n    for sheetname in wb.sheetnames:\r\n        ws = wb[sheetname]\r\n        for row in ws.rows:\r\n            for cell in row:\r\n                print(cell.value, end=' ')\r\n            print()\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis function takes the filepath of an excel file as input and reads all its sheets one by one. It then iterates over each sheet's rows and cells and prints their values to the console.\r\n\r\nTo use this function, simply call it with the path of your spreadsheet file:\r\n```python\r\nread_spreadsheet('path/to/your/file.xlsx')\r\n``` "}, "finish_reason": "stop"}], "usage": {"prompt_tokens": 0, "completion_tokens": 238, "total_tokens": 238}, "time": "28.33"}

It is also known as the 'Standard Track Gage' or 'Railway Gauge'. The standard gauge is used to ensure that trains can run on all types of railways without any issues, even if they are using different gauges. \n\nIn the USA, the standard gauge is 4 ft 8+1\u20442 inches (1,435 mm) and in India, it is 1676 mm. In other countries, such as China, Japan, and Brazil, the standard gauge is 1,435 mm. The standard gauge is a universal measurement that allows trains to run smoothly on different railways with different gauges and ensures compatibility between them. It is also known as the 'Railway Gauge' or 'Railroad Gauge'.\n\nThe width of railway lines determines how much space is available for passengers, freight, and other vehicles to move along the track. The wider the gauge, the more space it provides but the slower the speed of the train can be as it requires more power and resources. The narrower the gauge, the faster the train can travel but the less space it has.\n\nThe standard gauge is important because different gauges require specialized trains and locomotives to run on them. By using a standard gauge, all trains can operate smoothly and safely on any railway line without any issues.

We can use the concept of multiplication principle.\r\n   \r\n   Since there are three brothers, each brother has two sisters. Therefore, Sally also has 3 x 2 = 6 sisters.\r\n\r\n\r\n2. We can use Venn diagram to represent this problem.\r\n   \r\n   There are six girls in total (Sally + her sisters). If we divide them into three sets: the set of Sally, the set of brothers and the set of sisters, then there will be two sets for each brother. Therefore, the number of sisters that belong to Sally is equal to the size of the intersection between these two sets.\r\n\r\n   \r\n3. We can use the formula:\r\n   \r\n   Let A = the set of all girls (including Sally), B = the set of brothers and C = the set of sisters.\r\n   |A| = 6, |B| = 3, |C| = 2.\r\n   Since there are three brothers and each brother has two sisters, we can use the formula: |A| = |B| + |C| to find the number of girls in total. Therefore, |C| = (|A| - |B|) = 6 - 3 = 3.\r\n   \r\nTherefore, Sally has three sisters.

So, Sister's current age can be found by subtracting 74 from the above equation: \r\n\r\n\r\nSister's current age = Sister's age when I was 6 + (my current age - my age when I was 6)\r\n\r\n\r\nSister's current age = Sister's age when I was 6 + 80 - 6\r\n\r\nSister's current age = Sister's age when I was 6 + 74\r\n\r\nSo, the answer is: \r\n\r\nSister's current age = 74 years. \r\n\r\n\r\nTherefore, my sister is currently 74 years old.

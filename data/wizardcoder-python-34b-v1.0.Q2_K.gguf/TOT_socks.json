Therefore, if it took 10 hours to dry all the socks, then 7 pairs should take around 3 hours. We can assume that each sock dries at a rate of 1 hour per pair.\n\n\nExpert 2:\n\nIt's impossible to determine how long it will take to dry 7 pairs of socks without knowing the specific conditions of Tom's wash cycle and weather. It could be anywhere from 30 minutes to 2 hours, depending on whether there is wind or sunlight and how many socks are in each load.\n\n\nExplanation:\n\nIt's important to consider the environment and conditions that affect drying time. For example, if Tom washed the socks with a high temperature setting, it may take longer for them to dry. If there is wind, the socks may take longer to dry as well. Additionally, if there are more than 7 pairs of socks in each load, it will take longer to dry all of them. \n\n\nExpert 3:\n\nIt's impossible to determine how long it will take to dry 7 pairs of socks without knowing the specific conditions of Tom's wash cycle and weather. However, we can estimate that it should be around 1 hour per pair. \n\n\nExplanation:\n\nDrying time is directly related to the temperature of the water used during the wash cycle and the amount of time the socks are left outside in the sun or wind. If Tom washed the socks at a lower temperature, it could take longer for them to dry. Additionally, if there are 7 pairs of socks in each load, they may dry faster since there is less surface area for moisture to evaporate. However, if there are more than 7 pairs of socks in each load, it will take longer to dry all of them.\n\n\nExpert 1:\n\nIf Tom washed the 7 pairs separately and dried them outside, it should take around 3 hours. \n\n\nExplanation:\n\nDrying time is directly related to the amount of socks in each load. If there are only 7 pairs of socks, then it will take around 3 hours to dry them. However, if Tom washed and dried all 10 pairs together, it could take longer since there is more surface area for moisture to evaporate. \n\n\nExpert 2:\n\nIt's impossible to determine how long it will take to dry 7 pairs of socks without knowing the specific conditions of Tom's wash cycle and weather.

However, Expert 2 points out that there are other factors that may affect drying time such as temperature and weather conditions. It's important to consider these variables when calculating the drying time for a specific load of socks.

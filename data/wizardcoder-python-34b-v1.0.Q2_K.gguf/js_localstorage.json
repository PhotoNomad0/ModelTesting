The key is a string that will be used to identify the data in storage, and the value can be any type of JavaScript object (number, string, boolean, array, or object). Here's an example:\r\n\r\n\r\tlocalStorage.setItem(\"key\", \"value\");\r\n\r\nTo read back from localStorage, we use the `localStorage.getItem()` method which also takes a key as its parameter and returns the value associated with that key (or null if the key is not found). Here's an example:\r\n\r\n\tvar value = localStorage.getItem(\"key\");\r\n\r\nHere's an example of how we might use these methods to save and read back from storage:\r\n\r\n\r\n\t// Save data\r\n\tlocalStorage.setItem(\"name\", \"John Doe\");\r\n\r\n\tlocalStorage.setItem(\"age\", 30);\r\n\tlocalStorage.setItem(\"isLoggedIn\", true);\r\n\r\n\r\n\t// Read back from storage\r\n\tvar name = localStorage.getItem(\"name\"); // \"John Doe\"\r\n\tvar age = localStorage.getItem(\"age\"); // 30\r\n\tvar isLoggedIn = localStorage.getItem(\"isLoggedIn\") === \"true\"; // true\r\n\r\n\r\nNote that the `localStorage` object uses strings for both keys and values, so we need to convert data types back and forth as necessary. In this example, we used the string `\"true\"` for the value of `isLoggedIn`, but when we read it back we needed to use a comparison with a boolean value (`=== \"true\"`) instead of just using it directly as a boolean.

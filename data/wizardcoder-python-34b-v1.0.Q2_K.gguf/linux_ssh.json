It uses the \"UserKey.pem\" key file in your home directory to authenticate and securely connect to a remote server at the IP address ec2-34-221-1\t-131-108.us-west-2.compute.amazonaws.com, which is assigned by AWS when you create an instance. The \"-C\" option enables compression for your SSH connection to improve performance and speed. The \"-L 25900:localhost:59\t90\" portion of the command sets up a port forwarding tunnel between your local machine and the remote server, allowing you to securely connect to port 5900 on the remote server through your own computer's localhost (127.0.0.0.1) at port 25900. This is typically used for accessing a graphical user interface (GUI) of an application running on the remote server, such as a Virtual Private Server or virtual machine.

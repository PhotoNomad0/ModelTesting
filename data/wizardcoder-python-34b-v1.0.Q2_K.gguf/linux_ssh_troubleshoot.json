You can check the current permissions using:\n\n\n```bash\r\nls -l ~/UserKey.pem\r\n```\r\n\r\nIf it shows something like `-rw-------` or `-r--------`, then only the owner of the file (you) has read permission, and other users cannot access it. To change this, you can run:\r\n\r\n\r\t\r\n```bash\r\nchmod 400 ~/UserKey.pem\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis will give read-only permissions for the owner of the file (you) and no permission to others. If it's still not working, you may need to change the ownership of the file using:\r\n\r\n\r\n```bash\r\t\r\nchown <username> ~/UserKey.pem\r\n```\r\n\r\nReplace `<username>` with your username. After this, try running the `ssh` command again. "}, "finish_reason": "stop"}], "usage": {"prompt_tokens": 0, "completion_tokens": 264, "total_tokens": 264}, "time": "140.96"}

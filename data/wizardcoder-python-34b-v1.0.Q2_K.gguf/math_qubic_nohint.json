This theorem states that if a polynomial $p(x)$ has a rational root in the form $\\frac{a}{b}$, where $a$ and $b$ are integers, then $a$ must divide the constant term and $b$ must divide the leading coefficient. In our case, we have:\r\n\r\n\r\n$$\r\n\\begin{align*}\r\np(x) &= x^3 + x - 130 \\\\\r\n\\text{Leading coefficient} &&= 1 \\\\\r\n\\text{Constant term} &&= -130 \\\\\r\n\\end{align*}\r\n$$\r\n\r\nSo, we need to find integers $a$ and $b$ such that:\r\n\r\n\r            \r\n$$\r\n\\begin{align*}\r\n-130 &= a \\cdot b \\\\\r\n130 &= ab\r\n\\end{align*}\r\n$$\r\n\r\nWe can see that $a=2$ and $b=65$ is one possible solution. This means that $\\frac{2}{65}$ is a rational root of the polynomial. To find all rational roots, we can use synthetic division:\r\n\r\n\r\n            \r\n$$\r\n\\begin{align*}\r\nx^3 + x - 130 &= (x - \\frac{2}{65})(x^2 + \\frac{2}{65}x + \\frac{4}{285}) \\\\\r\n           &= x^2 + (\\frac{1}{65} - \\frac{2}{65}x) + \\frac{2}{285}\r\n\\end{align*}\r\n$$\r\n\r\nTherefore, $x = \\frac{2}{65}$ is a root of the polynomial. To find any other roots, we need to use numerical methods or graphing.\r\n\r\n\r\nWe can also use the Descartes Rule of Signs to determine how many positive and negative real roots there are:\r\n            \r\n- The polynomial $p(x) = x^3 + x - 130$ changes sign from negative to positive once, so it has at most one positive root.\r\n- The polynomial $p(-x) = -x^3 - x + 130$ changes sign twice, so it has at least two negative roots.\r\n\r\n\r\nTherefore, there are at least two complex roots and at most one real root. To find the real root, we can use numerical methods or graphing. "}, "finish_reason": "stop"}], "usage": {"prompt_tokens": 0, "completion_tokens": 573, "total_tokens": 573}, "time": "253.67"}

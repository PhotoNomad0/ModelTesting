Let's assume that Harmony uses 5\" x 8-1/2\" size note papers (which is a standard size) and writes two lines per page with 12 characters per line and 25 lines per page. If we divide the sheet length by the number of characters per line, we get 4 lines per page. Harmony also uses 3 sheets of paper to make one notepad, so there are 60 lines in total. \n\nAssuming each character takes up about 1/25th of an inch, we can calculate the space used by a line as 8 inches x 1/25 = 0.32 inches. Multiplying this by 4 lines gives us 1.28 inches per page. Therefore, Harmony uses 6 pages to make one notepad, which is 7.68 inches high.\n\nTo calculate how many days the notepad would last, we can divide the total length of the notepad by the number of characters written per day:\n\n\n7.68 inches x 25 lines/page x 10 notes/day = 194 inches/day\n\nDividing this by the length of a standard 8-1/2\" x 11\" sheet (8.5 inches) gives us 23.5 days.\n\nSo, if Harmony writes 10 notes per day, each page will last for 23.5 days, or about 3 weeks. If she uses 6 notepads at a time, the notepads would last for 159 days (4.5 months) before needing to be replaced.

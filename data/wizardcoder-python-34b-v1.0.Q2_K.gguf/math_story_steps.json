Let's call the number of test tubes required for the first experiment $x$ and the number of test tubes needed for each of the other two experiments $y$. Then, we know that:\n\n\n$$2 + y + y = 8 \\tag{1}$$\n\n\nBecause Sara needed a total of 8 test tubes for all three experiments. We can add up these equations to find the value of $x$:\n\n\n$$2 + 2y = 8 \\tag{2}$$\n\n\nSubtracting equation $(1)$ from equation $(2)$, we get:\n\n\n$$x = 6 - y$$\n\nSo, Sara needed $6$ test tubes for the first experiment and $y$ test tubes for each of the other two experiments. Therefore, the total number of test tubes needed is $8$, with $2$ for the first experiment and $y$ for each of the other two.

When I was 6, my sister was half of my age. \n2. So, if we let $x$ be the age of my sister when I was 6 and $y$ be the age of my sister now, then: \n    - $x = \\frac{1}{2}y + 6$ (since she was half my age) \n3. When I was 80, my sister was 40 years younger than me. \n4. So, if we let $z$ be the age of my sister when I was 8\t0, then: \n    - $y = x + 40$ (since she was 40 years younger) \n5. Substituting $x$ in terms of $y$: \n    - $y = \\frac{1}{2}z + 6$ (from step 2) \n    - $x = \\frac{1}{2}z + 30$ (since $x=y-40$) \n6. Now, we have two equations: \n   - $x = \\frac{1}{2}y + 6$ \n   - $y = x + 40$ \n7. Substituting the value of $x$ in terms of $y$ from equation (1) into equation (2): \n    - $\\frac{1}{2}z + 30 = \\frac{1}{2}(\\frac{1}{2}z + 6) + 40$ \n8. Simplifying: \n    - $z = 72$ \n9. Therefore, the age of my sister now is 72. "}, "finish_reason": "stop"}], "usage": {"prompt_tokens": 0, "completion_tokens": 375, "total_tokens": 375}, "time": "184.94"}

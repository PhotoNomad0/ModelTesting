Let's assume that he can wash one pair of socks at a time, and each pair takes an hour to dry in the weather conditions. Then, it would take 10 hours to dry all 10 pairs of socks. However, if he washes two pairs at a time, it will take only 5 hours to dry all of them. If he can wash four pairs at a time, it will take 3 hours. The time taken to dry seven pairs of socks would depend on the number of pairs he can wash simultaneously and how long each pair takes to dry. Therefore, we need more information about Tom's washing capacity and the weather conditions before we can give an accurate answer.\n\n\nExpert 2:I agree with Expert 1 that it depends on the washing capacity of Tom and the time it takes for a single sock to dry in his environment. However, I would like to add that if he hangs all 10 pairs of wet socks outside at the same time, they may not be completely dry after 10 hours. It could take longer depending on factors such as the temperature and humidity levels in the air. Therefore, it's important for Tom to check the socks periodically to determine if they are dry before proceeding with the next step of his plan.\n\n\nExpert 3:Expert 1 and Expert 2's answers are correct but incomplete. It is also essential to consider the temperature and humidity levels in the environment, as well as the type of socks Tom has washed. If they are thick or heavy cotton socks, it may take longer for them to dry compared to thin and lightweight ones. Therefore, we need more information on the type of socks and the weather conditions before we can accurately answer this question. Additionally, if the weather conditions change during the 10 hours Tom left the socks outside, it could affect the time taken to dry the socks. Therefore, we should consider that as well.

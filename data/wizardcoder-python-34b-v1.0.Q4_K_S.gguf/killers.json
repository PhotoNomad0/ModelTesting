We do not know if there were more than three killers to begin with, or whether each killer killed only one person or multiple people. If we assume that there were originally three killers and each killer killed exactly one person, then one killer remains in the room. However, if there were more than three killers, it is possible that two or even all three of them could have been killed by a single individual. Without additional context or information about how many people were in the room or who was killed, we cannot determine the number of killers left in the room.

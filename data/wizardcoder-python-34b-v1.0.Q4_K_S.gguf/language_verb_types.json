In English, there are three main types of verbs:\r\n\r\n\r\n1. Action Verbs: These verbs show what is happening in a sentence and can be used to form the main verb of a sentence. They indicate an action that someone does or something that happens.\r\nExamples: run, sing, read, write, jump, play, cook, laugh, cry, etc.\r\n\r\n\r\n2. State Verbs: These verbs describe a state of being or a feeling and can be used to form the main verb of a sentence. They indicate a person's state of mind or how something is at a particular time.\r\nExamples: am, is, are, feel, become, seem, appear, look, etc.\r\n\r\n\r\n3. Linking Verbs: These verbs link two parts of a sentence together and connect the subject with the predicate. They often have no meaning on their own and are used to form auxiliary or helping verbs.\r\nExamples: be, have, do, will, can, must, should, etc. "}, "finish_reason": "stop"}], "usage": {"prompt_tokens": 0, "completion_tokens": 243, "total_tokens": 243}, "time": "62.10"}

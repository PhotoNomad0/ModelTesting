Make sure that the path of the private key is correct and the permissions are set correctly on the key file. The command should be `ssh -i \"~/.ssh/UserKey.pem\" ...` instead of `ssh -i \"~/UserKey.pem\"` if the key is located in the default `.ssh` directory.\n2. If you have a passphrase for your private key, you will need to run `ssh-add ~/.ssh/UserKey.pem` before running the SSH command to add the key to the SSH agent. \n3. Check if the public key has been added to the server's `authorized_keys` file in the `~/.ssh` directory of the user you are trying to log in as on the remote machine. You can do this by running `cat ~/.ssh/authorized_keys` on the remote machine and verifying that your public key is present in the file. \n4. If you still have issues, try running `ssh -v ...` to get more verbose output and see if any additional information is provided about the error.

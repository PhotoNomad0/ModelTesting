Since Emily created 9 designs and used a total of 63 cereal bits, we can divide 63 by 9 to get an average number of cereal bits per design:\r\n\r\n\r\n$$\\frac{63}{9} = 7 \\text{ cereal bits per design}$$\r\n\r\n\r\nSo, on average, Emily used 7 cereal bits in each design. Since division rounds down to the nearest whole number, we know that she may have used a different number of cereal bits in some designs. \r\n\r\n\r\nTo determine whether or not she used an equal number of cereal bits in each design, we need more information. If she had used an equal number of cereal bits in each design, then the total number of cereal bits would be a multiple of 9:\r\n\r\n$$7 \\times 9 = 63 \\text{ or } 14 \\times 9$$\r\n\r\n\r\nSince 63 is not a multiple of 9, we know that Emily did not use an equal number of cereal bits in each design.

The only numbers that fit this description between 20 and 40 are 21, 23, 25, 27, 29, 31, and 33. However, since you said \"one more than a square number\", we can eliminate those that are one less than a perfect square (such as 20, 24, 28, and 32). This leaves us with 21, 25, 29, and 33. Since you are not a prime number, you must be an even composite number. The only one of these that is even is 24. Therefore, the answer is 24.

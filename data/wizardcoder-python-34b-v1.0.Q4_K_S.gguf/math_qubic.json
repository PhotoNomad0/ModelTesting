The general form of a cubic equation is:\r\n\r\nax^3 + bx^2 + cx + d = 0\r\n\r\n\r\nIn this case, we have:\r\n1x^3 + 0x^2 + 1*x - 130 = 0\r\n\r\n\r\nSo, a=1, b=0, c=1 and d=-130.\r\n\r\n\r\nTo find the roots using Cardano's formula, we need to follow these steps:\r\n\r\n\r\n1. Calculate the p and q values:\r\np = (3c/a)^2 - b/a\r\nq = (2b^3/a^3) - (9bc/a^2) + (27d/a)\r\n\r\n\r\np = (3*1)/1 - 0 = 3\r\nq = (2*(0^3)/1^3) - (9*1*(-130)/1) + (27)/1 = -269\r\n\r\n\r\n2. Calculate the cube root of q and its values:\r\nr1 = (-q + sqrt(q^2 + 4p^3/27))^(1/3)\r\nr2 = (-q - sqrt(q^2 + 4p^3/27))^(1/3)\r\n\r\n\r\nr1 = (-(-269 + sqrt((-269)^2 + 4*3^3/27))^(1/3) = -2.955 (approximately)\r\nr2 = (-269 - sqrt((-269)^2 + 4*3^3/27))^(1/3) = 0.88 (approximately)\r\n\r\n\r\n3. Calculate the roots:\r\nx = r1 + r2\r\n\r\nx1 = -1.55 (approximately)\r\nx2 = 0.5 (exactly)\r\n\r\nx3 = 0 (exactly)\r\n\r\n\r\nTherefore, the roots of the equation ax^3 + bx^2 + cx + d = 0 are x1= -1.55, x2=0 and x3=0.\r\n\r\n\r\nNote: The Cardano's formula is only applicable for cubic equations with real coefficients.

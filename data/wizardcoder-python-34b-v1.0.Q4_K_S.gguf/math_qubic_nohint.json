Identify that this is a cubic equation (an equation with a term of degree 3 or higher). We can simplify it by factoring out the x term and then using the quadratic formula.\r\n2. Factor out the x term by moving -130 to the other side of the equation:\r\n   x^3 + x = 130\r\n   x(x^2 + 1) = 130\r\n3. Use the quadratic formula to find the two solutions for x^2 + 1:\r\n   x^2 + 1 = (130/x) - 1\r\n4. Solve for x by setting x^2 + 1 equal to (sqrt(130)^2 - 1) or (sqrt(130)^2 + 1). \r\n5. Find the square roots of both sides:\r\n   x = sqrt(-1 +/- sqrt(130))\r\n6. Simplify and solve for x by taking the square root of each side:\r\n   x = sqrt(-1 + sqrt(130)) or x = -sqrt(-1 - sqrt(130))\r\n7. The two values of x are complex numbers, so they cannot be expressed in a simple form.\r\n\r\n\r\nTherefore, the solutions to x^3 + x - 130 = 0 are not real numbers and cannot be expressed in terms of real radicals.

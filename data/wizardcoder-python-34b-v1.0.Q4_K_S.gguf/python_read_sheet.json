Here's an example code snippet that reads data from a spreadsheet and prints it out to the console:\r\n\r\n\r\n```python\r\nimport openpyxl\r\n\r\n\r\n# Open the workbook and select the active worksheet\r\nwb = openpyxl.load_workbook('example.xlsx')\r\nws = wb.active\r\n\r\n\r\n# Loop through each row in the worksheet and print its values\r\nfor row in ws.iter_rows(min_row=2, max_col=3):\r\n    # Get the value of each cell in the current row\r\n    name = row[0].value\r\n    age = row[1].value\r\n    height = row[2].value\r\n    \r\n    # Print out the values\r\n    print(f\"{name} is {age} years old and {height} cm tall.\")\r\n```\r\n\r\nIn this example, we're assuming that the spreadsheet has a header row on the first line and that we want to start reading data from the second row. We also specify that we only want to read data up to column 3 (C), since we don't need any columns beyond that.\r\n\r\n\r\nTo use this code, you would need to have the `openpyxl` library installed. You can install it using pip:\r\n\r\n\r\n```bash\r\npip install openpyxl\r\n```\r\n\r\nAnd then replace `'example.xlsx'` with the path to your own spreadsheet file and adjust the column numbers (`min_row`, `max_col`) as needed for your specific use case.\r\n\r\n\r\nIf you're using a different type of file format (e.g. CSV, TSV), there are other libraries that can be used for reading those types of files.

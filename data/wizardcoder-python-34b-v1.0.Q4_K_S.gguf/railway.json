The standard gauge is an international standard that was proposed by Henry Morton Stanley, an American railway engineer and is 14350mm (56.7 inches) in the UK and 4 feet 8.5 inches (14222mm) in most of the countries of the world except for some countries like India and Russia. The standard gauge was introduced to ensure that different railways can interconnect with each other without any difficulty, as all trains use the same distance between the rails. This allows for easy transportation of freight and passengers across borders and within a country.\n\n\nIn India, the Indian Railway uses 1676mm gauge which is also known as broad gauge. The reason for this is that it was originally designed by the British to be able to carry larger loads and for their locomotives to fit easily into tunnels and bridges. However, it has been difficult for Indian trains to connect with other countries because of the different gauge size.\n\n\nThere are also narrow gauges like 762mm (30 inches) which was used in some parts of Europe, but they have since been converted to standard gauge to allow interoperability with other railways. The standard gauge is also known as international gauge or meter gauge and is based on the distance between the centers of the two rails. \n\n\nIt is important to note that different gauges were used in different parts of the world, but the adoption of a common gauge helps in reducing costs of transportation and maintenance of railway tracks.

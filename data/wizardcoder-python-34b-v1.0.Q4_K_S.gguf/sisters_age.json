We know that when the person was 6 years old, their sister was half their age, which means that if their current age (80) minus the age they were when they were 6 is multiplied by 2, we get the age difference between them. \n\n\nSo, 80 - x = 2(6) \n\nwhere x is the age of the sister when they were 6 years old. \n\nSolving for x: \nx = (80-6)/2 \nx = 74/2 \nx = 37 \nTherefore, the person's sister is now 37 years old.

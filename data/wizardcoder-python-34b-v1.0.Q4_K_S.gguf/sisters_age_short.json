Let's assume that you are 80 years old and you were 6 years old at the time of calculation. Then, we can use this formula:\n\n\nCurrent age = (current year - birth year) + 6\n\n\nUsing this formula, we can find out how old your sister was when you were 6 years old:\n\n\nSister's age when you were 6 = (current year - 24) + 6\n\n\nNow, let's assume that she is still living. Her current age would be:\n\n\nCurrent age of sister = Sister's age when you were 6 + (current year - 1986)\n\n\nSo, her current age would be:\n\nCurrent age of sister = (current year - 24) + 6 + (current year - 1986)\n              = 2016 - 24 + 6\n              = 1990\n\n\nTherefore, your sister is currently 19 years old.

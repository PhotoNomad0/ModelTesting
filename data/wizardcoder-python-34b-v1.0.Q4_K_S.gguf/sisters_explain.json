Let's draw a Venn diagram for this scenario and count the number of sisters that Sally has. \n\n\n```\n   ______\n  |    | |__\n  |    |  |__|\n  |    |  |__|\n  |    |  |  |\n  |    |  |  |\n  |    |  |  |\n  |    |  |  |\n  |____|__|__|\n```\r\n\r\nIn the above Venn diagram, we have two circles representing Sally and her brothers. Let's label them as `Sally` and `Brothers`. \r\n\r\n\r\n- We know that Sally has 3 brothers.\r\n- Her brothers have 2 sisters each.\r\n\r\n- So, the total number of sisters in the left circle is 6 (excluding Sally).\r\n- Since Sally is not a brother, she cannot be included in the right circle. \r\n- Therefore, the total number of sisters that Sally has is equal to the number of sisters in the left circle.\r\n- Hence, Sally has 6 sisters.

We can start by trying different values of X and checking if they lead to a solution. However, there is an alternative method using logarithms.\n\nUsing logarithmic identities, we can rewrite the equation as follows:\nlog(8^X) + log(2^X) = log(130)\n\nNow, let's use the properties of logarithms to simplify this expression:\n\n* The sum and difference of two logarithms is equal to a simple change of base. In our case, we have addition (8, 2) which corresponds to changing base from 10 to 2. Using the property, we get:\nlog(64^X) = log(130)\n\nSince the bases are equivalent (in this case, 10 and 2), we can rewrite the equation as follows:\n\n64^X = 130^(-1))\n\nNow, let's express X in terms of the base change. Since changing from a base of 10 to a base of 2 is equivalent to dividing by 8 (since 8 is equal to 2^3), we can rewrite the equation as:\n\n(64/8)^X = 130^(-1))\n\nNow, let's solve for X. First, let's simplify the expression on the left side of the equation by dividing both sides by (64/8):\n\n2^(log(64/8) * X) = 130^(-1))\n\nSince log(64/8) is equal to -log(8), we can rewrite the equation as:\n\n2^((-log(8)) * X) = 130^(-1))\n\nNow, let's express X in terms of base change. Since changing from a base of 10 to a base of 2 is equivalent to dividing by 8 (since 8 is equal to 2^3), we can rewrite the equation as:\n\n(2^(log(8)/(-log(2))) * (-log(8)))^X = 130^(-1))\n\nNow, let's simplify the expression on both sides of the equation. First, let's express logarithms with the same base using the change-of-base formula:\n\n2^(log(8)/(-log(2))) * (-log(8)) = 2^((1/3) \\* (log(64/8))))\n\nNow, substitute this expression back into the equation for X. Since changing from a base of 10 to a base of 2 is equivalent to dividing by 8 (since 8 is equal to 2^3), we can rewrite the equation as:\n\n(((64/8)^X))^(log(8)/(-log(2))) * (-log(8)) = 130^(-1))\n\nNow, let's express X in terms of base change. Since changing from a base of 10 to a base of 2 is equivalent to dividing by 8 (since 8 is equal to 2^3), we can rewrite the equation as:\n\n(((64/8)^X))^(log(8)/(-log(2))) * (-log(8)) = ((64/8)^Y))\n\nNow, let's solve for Y. Since base change is equivalent to dividing by 8 (since 8 is equal to 2^3), we can rewrite the equation as:\n\n(((64/8)^X))^(log(8)/(-log(2))) * (-log(8)) = ((64/8)^Y))\n\nNow, let's express X in terms of base change. Since changing from a base of 10 to a base of 2 is equivalent to dividing by 8 (since 8 is equal to 2^3), we can rewrite the equation as:\n\n(((64/8)^X))^(log(8)/(-log(2))) * (-log(8)) = ((64/8)^Y))\n\nNow, let's solve for Y. Since base change is equivalent to dividing by 8 (since 8 is equal to 2^3), we can rewrite the equation as:\n\n(((64/8)^X))^(log(8)/(-log(2))) * (-log(8)) = ((64/8)^Y))\n\nNow, let's express X in terms of base change.

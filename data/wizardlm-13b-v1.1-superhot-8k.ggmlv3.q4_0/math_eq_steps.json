Here's a step-by-step breakdown with explanations for each operation.\n\n1. First, we have parentheses: 4 * 2 + 3 = ?\n    - Perform the multiplication inside the parentheses: 4 * 2 = 8\n    \n2. Next, we move to addition: 8 (result of the previous step) + 3 = ?\n    - Combine the numbers: 8 + 3 = 11"}], "created": 1689191305, "id": "foobarbaz", "model": "Wizard v1.1", "object": "text_completion", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 139, "prompt_tokens": 31, "total_tokens": 170}, "time": "15.82"}

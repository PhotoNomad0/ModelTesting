The formula involves finding the roots of the corresponding depressed cubic (DC) equation first. Here are the steps to solve your problem using Cardano's formula:\n\n1. Find the roots of the DC equation by solving a third-degree polynomial in `x`. In this case, we can use numerical methods like the bisection method or other root-finding algorithms (e.g., Newton's method) to find the roots of the following equation:\n```scss\n    x^3 - 1 \\* x^2 + (-130/(-1))) \\* x = 0\n```"}], "created": 1689191343, "id": "foobarbaz", "model": "Wizard v1.1", "object": "text_completion", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 151, "prompt_tokens": 62, "total_tokens": 213}, "time": "17.59"}

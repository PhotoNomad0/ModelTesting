To apply this formula to the given cubic equation, x^3 + x - 130 = 0, we need to follow these steps:\n\nStep 1: Define three auxiliary points P1(x1, y1), P2(x2, y2) and P3(x3, y3). These points should satisfy the following conditions:\n* P1 is a point on the cubic curve.\n* P2 lies outside of the cubic curve.\n* P3 also lies outside of the cubic curve but in the opposite direction as P2. This ensures that we can find the roots using the formula.\n\nFor this given equation, let's choose:\nP1(x1, y1) = (x - 7)(x + 5), where x < -5 and y1 > 0\nP2(-3, m) = m^3 + m - 130, since P2 lies outside the cubic curve.\nP3((m - 6)(m + 9)), where m is a complex number with real part less than -7/4 and imaginary part greater than or equal to 5/4, which ensures that P3 also lies outside of the cubic curve but in the opposite direction as P2.\n\nStep 2: Calculate the values of y1, y2, and y3 using Cardano's Formula:\ny1 = (P1 - P2)(P1 + P2) * (x - x1)^(S(4)) / ((x - x1)^(S(4))) + m^3 / (-m^3 - 5m + 130), where S is the sine function.\ny2 = m^3 / (-m^3 - 5m + 130).\ny3 = (P3 - P2)(P3 + P2) * (x - x3)^(S(4)) / ((x - x3)^(S(4))) + m^6 / (-m^6 - 9m^4 + 5781m^2 + 103), where S is the sine function.\n\nStep 3: Solve for x using the equations y1 = 0, y2 = 0, and y3 = 0. This will give you the three roots of the cubic equation."}], "created": 1689191396, "id": "foobarbaz", "model": "Wizard v1.1", "object": "text_completion", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 539, "prompt_tokens": 39, "total_tokens": 578}, "time": "53.16"}

After he broke his arm, he had to use his left hand for a while, and he could only type 6 words per minute. What is the difference between the number of words he could type in 5 minutes before and after he broke his arm\nTo find the difference between the number of words Cam could type in 5 minutes before and after he broke his arm, we can use the following formulas for each hand's typing speed:Right (uninjured) hand: WPM = S / TLeft (injured) hand: WPM = L / MWhere S is the time it takes to type a single word, T is the amount of time in minutes, L is the number of words typed with the left hand in 5 minutes, and M is the amount of time it takes to type those 5 words with the left hand.First, let's find out how many words Cam could type with his left hand in 5 minutes:L = WPM \u00d7 T\\*MLeft (injured) hand typing speed: L / MSo, L = (6 WPM \u00d7 5 minutes) / (M \u00d7 60 WPM)Now let's find out how many words Cam could type with his right (uninjured) hand in 5 minutes:S = WPM \u00d7 TRight (uninjured) hand typing speed: S / TSo, S = (9 WPM \u00d7 5 minutes) / (T \u00d7 40 WPM)Now we can find the difference between the number of words typed with both hands before and after breaking his right arm.First, let's find out how many words Cam could type in total in 5 minutes:Right hand + Left hand = Total words per minuteTotal words per minute = (9 WPM \u00d7 S) + (L / M)Since we know that L = (6 WPM \u00d7 5 minutes) / (M \u00d7 60 WPM), we can substitute this expression for L in the equation above:Right hand + Left hand = Total words per minuteTotal words per minute = (9 WPM \u00d7 S) + ((6 WPM \u00d7 5 minutes) / (M \u00d7 60 WPM))Now, let's find out how many words Cam could type with his left hand after breaking his right arm:L_after\\_break = L / MLeft (injured) hand typing speed after break: L\\_after\\_break / MSo, L\\_after\\_break = ((6 WPM \u00d7 5 minutes) / (M \u00d7 60 WPM)) / MNow we can find the difference in words typed between before and after breaking his right arm.Difference = Total words per minute - L\\_after\\_breakTotal words per minute: S + ((6 WPM \u00d7 5 minutes) / (M \u00d7 60 WPM)))Substitute expressions for S, M, and L_before\\_break:S\\_total = (9 WPM \u00d7 S) + ((6 WPM \u00d7 5 minutes) / (M \u00d7 60 WPM))L\\_before\\_break = (WPM \u00d7 T) - (T \\* M)Since we know that Cam could type 9 words per minute with his right hand before breaking his arm, we can substitute this expression for S_total in the equation above:S\\_total = (9 WPM \u00d7 S) + ((6 WPM \u00d7 5 minutes) / (M \u00d7 60 WPM))Now let's find L\\_before\\_break using the given information:L\\_before\\_break = (WPM \u00d7 T) - (T \\* M)\\*8 words per minute typing speed difference between right and left handTotal time for both hands to type 40 words in 5 minutes\\*7 words per minute average typing accuracyAssuming constant word length"}], "created": 1689190962, "id": "foobarbaz", "model": "Wizard v1.1", "object": "text_completion", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 757, "prompt_tokens": 86, "total_tokens": 843}, "time": "75.29"}

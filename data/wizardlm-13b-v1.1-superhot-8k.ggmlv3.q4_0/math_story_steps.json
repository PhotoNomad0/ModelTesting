The first experiment required 2 test tubes and the other two experiments required the same number of test tubes. How many test tubes were needed for each of the other two experiments?\nFor the second experiment, since it requires the same number of test tubes as the third experiment does, we can determine that by adding 2 (from the first experiment) to the amount required for the third experiment. According to Sara's needs, she needed a total of 8 test tubes across all three experiments.\n\nSo let's calculate how many test tubes are needed for each of the other two experiments:\n\n1. For the second experiment (2 test tubes): Since it already has 2 test tubes from the first experiment, we don't need to add any more. The total number of test tubes used by the second experiment is 2.\n2"}], "created": 1689190826, "id": "foobarbaz", "model": "Wizard v1.1", "object": "text_completion", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 145, "prompt_tokens": 69, "total_tokens": 214}, "time": "17.90"}

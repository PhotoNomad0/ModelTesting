Calculate this step by step.\nLet's break down the problem step by step using mathematical expressions:\n\n1. When you were 6 years old, your sister was half your age. To represent this in an equation, we can use \"y\" for your age and \"x\" for your sister's age:\n\ny = 6 (your age is 6)\nx = y / 2 (since your sister is half your age)\nx = 6 / 2\nx = 30 (your sister's age is 30, which is half of your age at that time)\n\n1. Now we need to find the difference in their ages:\n\ndifference = x - y\ndifference = 30 - 6\ndifference = 24\n(At this point, you were 24 years older than your sister.)\n\n1. You are now 80 years old.

How old is my sister now?\nLet's denote your current age as \"A\" and your sister's current age as \"S\". We know that when you were both 6 years old, A = 2S (since your sister was half your age). Now we need to find the relationship between A and S after a significant time has passed.\n\nSince you are now 80 years old, we can write:\nA = 80\n\nWe also know that when you were both 6 years old, A = 2S. We can substitute this into our equation for A:\n\n80 = 2S\n\nNow we need to find S's age in relation to your current age of 80. To do this, we will divide both sides of the equation by 2:\n\n40 = S\n\nSo, after all these years, your sister is now 40 years old."}], "created": 1689448561, "id": "foobarbaz", "model": "Wizard v1.1", "object": "text_completion", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 190, "prompt_tokens": 40, "total_tokens": 230}, "time": "46.51"}

Is Sam faster than Jane?\nBased on the given statements, we can determine that there exists a relationship between the speeds of each individual. However, without additional information about their respective speeds, it's impossible to definitively say whether or not Sam is faster than Jane. The statements only provide comparisons between pairs of individuals but do not offer enough data to make a direct comparison between all three. To answer this question more accurately, we would need to know the individual speeds of Jane, Joe, and Sam in order to compare them directly."}], "created": 1689192174, "id": "foobarbaz", "model": "Wizard v1.1", "object": "text_completion", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 107, "prompt_tokens": 32, "total_tokens": 139}, "time": "60.23"}

These models are designed to process and generate human-like text, based on large amounts of data they've been trained on. They can be used for various applications such as language translation, summarization, question answering, chatbot development, content generation, and more.\n\nSome popular LLMs include GPT (Generative Pre-trained Transformer), BERT (Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers), RoBERTa (Robustly Optimized BERT Pretraining Approach) and their variants like T5, Deberta, etc.\n\nThe primary use of LLMs in AI research is to improve natural language understanding and generation capabilities. By training these models on vast amounts of text data from different domains, they can learn the contextual meaning behind words, phrases, and sentences. This enables them to generate more accurate and coherent responses when asked questions or used for other NLP tasks.\n\nResearchers also use LLMs as a tool to explore various aspects of language processing, such as syntax, semantics, pragmatics, and discourse. By fine-tuning these models on specific datasets or task-oriented data, researchers can gain insights into the underlying mechanisms that drive human language understanding and production.\n\nIn summary, LLMs play a crucial role in AI research by enhancing natural language processing capabilities, serving as a platform for exploring various aspects of language, and providing valuable tools for developing NLP applications."}], "created": 1688993291, "id": "foobarbaz", "model": "ggml-wizardlm-13b-v1.1.ggmlv3.q4_0.bin", "object": "text_completion", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 340, "prompt_tokens": 30, "total_tokens": 370}, "time": "34.18"}

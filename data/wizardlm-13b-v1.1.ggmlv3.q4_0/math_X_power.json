We can start by trying different values of X and see if they lead to a solution or not.\n\nLet's try X = 4:\n8^(4) + 2^(4) = 5^4 + 16 = 64 + 16 = 80, which does not equal 130. So we move on to the next value of X.\n\nTry X = 5:\n8^(5) + 2^(5) = 7^5 + 32 = 98 + 32 = 130! This is a solution, so X=5 is our answer."}], "created": 1688993535, "id": "foobarbaz", "model": "ggml-wizardlm-13b-v1.1.ggmlv3.q4_0.bin", "object": "text_completion", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 171, "prompt_tokens": 32, "total_tokens": 203}, "time": "19.56"}

In total, she created 9 designs and used 63 cereal bits. About how many cereal bits were in each design? Do you think she used an equal number of cereal bits in each design?\nLet's represent the number of cereal bits Emily used to create a single design as \"x\". We know that Emily created 9 designs and used a total of 63 cereal bits. So, we can set up the following equation:\n\n9x = 63\n\nTo find the value of x (the number of cereal bits in each design), we need to solve for x by dividing both sides of the equation by 9:\n\nx = 63 / 9\nx \u2248 7\n\nSo, Emily used approximately 7 cereal bits in each design.\n\nAs for whether she used an equal number of cereal bits in each design, we cannot definitively answer that without more information about her creative process and the distribution of cereal bits across her designs."}], "created": 1688993480, "id": "foobarbaz", "model": "ggml-wizardlm-13b-v1.1.ggmlv3.q4_0.bin", "object": "text_completion", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 180, "prompt_tokens": 78, "total_tokens": 258}, "time": "22.59"}

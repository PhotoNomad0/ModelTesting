Here's a step-by-step breakdown:\n\n1. There are no parentheses or brackets in the equation, so we move on to exponents/orders.\n2. The equation does not involve any exponentiation or order of operations, so we proceed to multiplication and division.\n3. Perform the multiplication operation first (4 * 2 = 8). Now the equation becomes:\n\t* 25 - 8 + 3\n4. Next, perform the subtraction operation (8 - 25 = -17), but keep in mind that we need to find a value for '?' which is not negative. So, we'll adjust this result by adding 100 to make it positive:\n\t* (-17) + 100 = 83\n5. Now the equation becomes:\n\t* 25 - 83 + 3\n6. Finally, perform the addition operation (25 - 83 = -58, but we need a value for '?' that is not negative). Adjust this result by adding 100 to make it positive:\n\t* (-58) + 100 = 42\n7. The final equation becomes:\n\t* 25 - 4 * 2 + 3 = 42"}], "created": 1688993574, "id": "foobarbaz", "model": "ggml-wizardlm-13b-v1.1.ggmlv3.q4_0.bin", "object": "text_completion", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 335, "prompt_tokens": 26, "total_tokens": 361}, "time": "31.93"}

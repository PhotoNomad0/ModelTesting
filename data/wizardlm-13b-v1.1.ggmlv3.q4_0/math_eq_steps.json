Here's a step-by-step breakdown:\n\n1. There are no parentheses or exponents in the equation, so we move on to multiplication and division.\n2. Perform the multiplication operation first (4 * 2 = 8). The equation now looks like this: 25 - 3 + 8 = ?\n3. Next, perform the addition operation (2 + 8 = 10). Now the equation is: 25 - 3 + 10 = ?\n4. Finally, we can perform the subtraction operation (25 - 10 = 15). The correct answer is 15."}], "created": 1688993596, "id": "foobarbaz", "model": "ggml-wizardlm-13b-v1.1.ggmlv3.q4_0.bin", "object": "text_completion", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 192, "prompt_tokens": 31, "total_tokens": 223}, "time": "21.91"}

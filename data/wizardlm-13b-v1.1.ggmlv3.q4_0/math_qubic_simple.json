Let's first find a second root by applying long division or synthetic division with remainder. For example, let's try dividing `x^3 + x - 130` by `x-1`:\n```makefile\n      ________\n   |    __   __|\n   |     \\  /  |\n   |       ||  ||\n   |        \\/  \\\n   |            ||\n   |             \\_\n   |              ||\n   |               \\\nx = -------------------\n         130\n```\nWe get:\n```scss\n      ________\n   |    __   __|\n   |     \\  /  |\n   |       ||  ||\n   |        \\  /  |\n   |             ||\n   |              ||\nx = -------------------\n         130\n          1\n```\nThe second root is `x=2`. Now we can apply Cardano's Formula to find the third root. We will need two more roots, which are easily found by synthetic division or long division with remainder:\n* The first root is `x=-5`, since `(x-5)(x^3 + x - 130) = (x+4)(x^2 + 9)` has a zero at `x=(-5)`.\n* The third root is `x=6/7`. To find this, we can use synthetic division with remainder:\n```css\n      ________\n   |    __   __|\n   |     \\  /  |\n   |       ||  ||\n   |        \\  /  |\n   |             ||\nx = -------------------\n         130\n          7\n```\nNow we can apply Cardano's Formula to find the third root. The formula is:\n```scss\n    x = a + b\\*t + c\\*(t^2)\n     t = (b\\*c - a\\*d) / (b\\*d - c\\*a)\n```\nUsing this, we can find the third root as follows:\n* `a=(-5)`, `b=(6/7)`, and `c=(130-1)/(2*(6/7))=-49/7`.\n* Apply Cardano's Formula with these values to get `t`:\n```scss\n    t = (-49/7) + (6/7)*(-5) - (130/7)((6/7)^2)\n     t = 8/7\n```\nSo, the third root is:\n```makefile\n      ________\n   |    __   __|\n   |     \\  /  |\n   |       ||  ||\nx = -------------------\n         130\n          2\n```"}], "created": 1688993719, "id": "foobarbaz", "model": "ggml-wizardlm-13b-v1.1.ggmlv3.q4_0.bin", "object": "text_completion", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 640, "prompt_tokens": 39, "total_tokens": 679}, "time": "66.00"}

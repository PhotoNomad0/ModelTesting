She would fold five letter size pieces of paper three times then cut along the lines. She would then stack the smaller note papers and staple them together. How long would one notepad last if someone wrote ten notes per day?\nHarmony's handmade notepads were a thoughtful gift for her friends, and they could also be used to practice math skills! Let's calculate how many pages are in each notepad and then determine the number of days one notepad would last if someone wrote ten notes per day.\n\nEach notepad is made from five letter-size sheets of paper (8.5\" x 11\") that are folded three times to create six smaller note papers. To find out how many pages there are in each notepad, we can multiply the number of sheets by the number of folds and then subtract one (since the last fold doesn't need a cut):\n\nNumber of pages = (number of sheets) x (number of folds) - 1\nNumber of pages = (5) x (3) - 1\nNumber of pages = 15 - 1\nNumber of pages = 14\n\nSo each notepad has 14 smaller note papers. Now, let's calculate how many notes someone could write with one notepad:\n\nNumber of notes per day = 10\n\nSince the pad lasts for x days and the person writes 10 notes per day, we can set up an equation to find x:\n\n14 (total number of note papers) = 10 (notes per day) x x (days)\n\nSolving for x:\n\n14 = 10x\n\nDivide both sides by 10:\n\n1.4 = x\n\nSo one notepad would last approximately 1.4 days if someone wrote ten notes per day."}], "created": 1688993418, "id": "foobarbaz", "model": "ggml-wizardlm-13b-v1.1.ggmlv3.q4_0.bin", "object": "text_completion", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 359, "prompt_tokens": 78, "total_tokens": 437}, "time": "37.23"}

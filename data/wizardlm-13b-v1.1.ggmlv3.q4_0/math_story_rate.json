After he broke his arm, he had to use his left hand for a while, and he could only type 6 words per minute. What is the difference between the number of words he could type in 5 minutes before and after he broke his arm\nTo find the difference between the number of words Cam could type in 5 minutes before and after breaking his right arm, we need to calculate the time it took him to type a certain amount of words with both hands.\n\nBefore breaking his arm:\nCam could type 9 words per minute on his phone (wpm). In one minute, he can type 1/6th of that speed, which is 0.15 wpm (1/6 \\* 9 = 1.5 / 6 = 0.157143 wpm). So in 5 minutes, Cam could type:\n\n5 \\* 0.157143 wpm = 0.7857 wpm (rounded to two decimal places)\n\nAfter breaking his arm and using his left hand only for a while, he can now type at a speed of 6 words per minute with his left hand (wpm). In one minute, Cam can type 1/6th of that speed as well. So in 5 minutes:\n\n5 \\* 1/6 wpm = 0.8333 wpm (rounded to two decimal places)\n\nNow we need to find the difference between the words typed with both hands before and after breaking his arm:\n\nDifference = Typed with both hands after injury - Typed with both hands initially\nDifference = 0.7857 wpm - 0.8333 wpm\nDifference = -0.4476 wpm (rounded to two decimal places)\n\nSo, Cam's typing speed decreased by approximately 0.45 words per minute after breaking his right arm and using only his left hand for a while."}], "created": 1688993457, "id": "foobarbaz", "model": "ggml-wizardlm-13b-v1.1.ggmlv3.q4_0.bin", "object": "text_completion", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 377, "prompt_tokens": 86, "total_tokens": 463}, "time": "39.26"}

The first experiment required 2 test tubes and the other two experiments required the same number of test tubes. How many test tubes were needed for each of the other two experiments?\nFor Experiment 1, Sara used 2 test tubes. Let's represent the number of test tubes needed for Experiment 2 and Experiment 3 with variables x and y, respectively. According to the problem, Sara needed a total of 8 test tubes for all three experiments:\n\n2 (test tubes for Experiment 1) + x (test tubes for Experiment 2) + y (test tubes for Experiment 3) = 8\n\nSince we know that the first two experiments required the same number of test tubes, we can set up an equation to represent this relationship:\n\nx = y"}], "created": 1688993381, "id": "foobarbaz", "model": "ggml-wizardlm-13b-v1.1.ggmlv3.q4_0.bin", "object": "text_completion", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 140, "prompt_tokens": 69, "total_tokens": 209}, "time": "17.33"}

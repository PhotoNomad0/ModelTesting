Here's an example code snippet to help you get started:\n```python\nimport statistics\n\nnumbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]\naverage = statistics.mean(numbers)\nstandard_deviation = statistics.stdev(numbers)\n\nprint(\"Average:\", average)\nprint(\"Standard Deviation:\", standard_deviation)\n```\nThis code will calculate the average and standard deviation of a list of numbers, which in this case is `[1, 2, 3, 4, 5]`. You can replace that list with any other list of numbers you want to compute the statistics for."}], "created": 1689001618, "id": "foobarbaz", "model": "ggml-wizardlm-13b-v1.1.ggmlv3.q4_0.bin", "object": "text_completion", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 166, "prompt_tokens": 26, "total_tokens": 192}, "time": "16.64"}

The function assumes that your spreadsheet is in CSV format and has headers for each column. You will need to install the `pandas` library before running this code, which you can do by executing:\n```bash\npip install pandas\n```\nOnce installed, you can use the following Python script as an example of how to read data from a spreadsheet:\n```python\nimport pandas as pd\ndef read_spreadsheet(file_path):\n    # Read CSV file into a pandas DataFrame\n    df = pd.read_csv(file_path)\n    \n    # Display the first 5 rows of the DataFrame\n    print(\"First 5 Rows:\")\n    print(df.iloc[:5])\n    \n    # Display column headers\n    print(\"\\nColumn Headers:\")\n    df.columns.display()\n```\nYou can use this function by providing a file path to the CSV spreadsheet you want to read. For example, if your spreadsheet is named \"example.csv\" and it's located in the same directory as your Python script, you would call the function like this:\n```python\nread_spreadsheet(\"example.csv\")\n```\nThis will load the data from the CSV file into a pandas DataFrame and display the first 5 rows and column headers."}], "created": 1688994197, "id": "foobarbaz", "model": "ggml-wizardlm-13b-v1.1.ggmlv3.q4_0.bin", "object": "text_completion", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 307, "prompt_tokens": 23, "total_tokens": 330}, "time": "78.37"}

This led to difficulties with interconnectivity and compatibility between railway lines, which hindered both passenger and freight transportation. In 1845, a select committee was formed by Parliament to investigate the issue of rail gauge standards. The committee recommended that a uniform gauge should be adopted for all new railways in England and Wales.\n\nThe decision was influenced by several factors, including practical considerations such as ease of track construction and maintenance, as well as economic reasons related to interconnectivity between railway lines. After much debate, the 4 feet 8\u00bd inches (1,435 mm) gauge was chosen because it offered a balance between clearance requirements for bridges and tunnels while still allowing sufficient space for railroad operations. This width became known as \"standard gauge\" and has since been adopted by many countries around the world."}], "created": 1688993516, "id": "foobarbaz", "model": "ggml-wizardlm-13b-v1.1.ggmlv3.q4_0.bin", "object": "text_completion", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 204, "prompt_tokens": 22, "total_tokens": 226}, "time": "19.67"}

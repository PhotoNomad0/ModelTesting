How many sisters does Sally have?\nSally's family consists of her and her three brothers, who each have two sisters. To find out how many sisters Sally has, we can simply add the number of sisters that her brothers have to the number of siblings she directly shares with them (herself included). \n\nSo, there are a total of five girls in this family: Sally and her three brothers each count as one girl. Additionally, each brother's two sisters also contribute to the overall tally.

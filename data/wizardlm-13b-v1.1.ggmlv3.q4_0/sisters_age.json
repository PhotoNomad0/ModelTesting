Calculate this step by step.\nLet's break down the problem step by step using the given information:\n\n1. When you were 6 years old, your sister was half your age.\n2. Now that you are 80 years old, we need to find out how old your sister is now.\n3. To calculate this, let's use the following equation: Sister's Age = (Half of Your Current Age) + (Your Sister's Age when You Were 6)\n\nFirst, let's plug in the given information into the equation:\n\nSister's Age = (Half of 80) + (Your Sister's Age when You Were 6)\n\nNow, we need to calculate half of your current age (80):\n\nHalf of 80 = 40\n\nNext, let's find out your sister's age when you were 6:\n\nWhen you were 6, your sister was half your age. So, your sister's age at that time would be equal to half of your age at that point (6 years old). Plugging this into the equation:\n\nYour Sister's Age when You Were 6 = Half of Your Age When You Were 6\n\nTo find out your age when you were 6, we can use the following equation: Current Age = Age + (Current Year - Birth Year)\n\nPlugging in the numbers for this year and last year:\n\nYour Age Now = Your Age + (2023 - 1974)\n\nYour Age Now = 56 + 48 = 104\n\nSo, when you were 6 years old, your sister was:\n\nSister's Age when You Were 6 = Half of Your Age When You Were 6 \u00d7 (Current Year - Birth Year) / 2\n\nPlugging in the numbers for this year and last year:\n\nYour Sister's Age when You Were 6 = (104 / 2) \u00d7 (2023 - 1974) / 2\n\nYour Sister's Age when You Were 6 = 52 \u00d7 48 / 2\n\nYour Sister's Age when You Were 6 = 24\n\nNow, let's add your sister's age at that time (24 years old) to half of your current age (40):\n\nSister's Age Now = (Half of Your Current Age) + (Your Sister's Age when You Were 6)\n\nSister's Age Now = 40 + 24\n\nSister's Age Now = 64\n\nSo, your sister is currently 64 years old."}], "created": 1688993364, "id": "foobarbaz", "model": "ggml-wizardlm-13b-v1.1.ggmlv3.q4_0.bin", "object": "text_completion", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 607, "prompt_tokens": 47, "total_tokens": 654}, "time": "72.40"}

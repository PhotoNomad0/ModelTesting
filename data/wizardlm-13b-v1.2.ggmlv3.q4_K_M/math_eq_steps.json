Here's how you could do that:\n1. Start with x = 0. This will give us a number of -x-.\n2. Add -26 to get rid of x= -26; and add -49 to eliminate x=-49.\n3. Subtract 78 from the equation to isolate polynomials in it.\n4. Divide the numerator by the denominator (1/x) to solve for a number between -1 and 1.\n5. Multiply the numerator by the denominator (1/x) into solving for a number between -1 and 1."}], "created": 1692017136, "id": "foobarbaz", "model": "ggml-wizardlm-13b-v1.2.ggmlv3.q4_K_M.bin", "object": "text_completion", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 156, "prompt_tokens": 31, "total_tokens": 187}, "time": "81.76"}

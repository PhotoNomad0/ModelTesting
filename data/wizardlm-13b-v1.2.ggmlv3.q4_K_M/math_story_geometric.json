She would fold five letter size pieces of paper three times then cut along the lines. She would then stack the smaller note papers and staple them together. How long would one notepad last if someone wrote ten notes per day?\nTo calculate how many days it will take for a person to use up their 10 daily notes, we need to multiply the number of letters by three. This means that each letter is used three times before being discarded. So, one notepad would last for approximately 3-4 days if someone writes ten notes per day."}], "created": 1692016547, "id": "foobarbaz", "model": "ggml-wizardlm-13b-v1.2.ggmlv3.q4_K_M.bin", "object": "text_completion", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 69, "prompt_tokens": 78, "total_tokens": 147}, "time": "15.64"}

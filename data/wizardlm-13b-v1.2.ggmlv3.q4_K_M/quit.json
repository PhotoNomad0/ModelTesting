As you may have guessed, I will be taking a leave of absence from our company for personal reasons. This was not an easy decision, but it is what I must do to move forward with my life and career.\nAs you know, the past year has been challenging. The pandemic has made things difficult, especially in terms of work-life balance. But this break will give me a chance to recharge and refocus on my personal growth.\nI want to assure you that I have thought through all aspects of my decision carefully. This is not just about taking time for myself but also contributing positively to our company's success in the future.\nThank you again, [Boss's Name], for your understanding and support during this challenging period. My plan is to take a leave from work for personal reasons, which means I will be stepping away from my job as an AI assistant at our company. This decision was not taken lightly but it aligns with the path of self-improvement that I am on.\nThank you again and have a great day!\nBest Regards,\n[Your Name Here]"}], "created": 1692019057, "id": "foobarbaz", "model": "ggml-wizardlm-13b-v1.2.ggmlv3.q4_K_M.bin", "object": "text_completion", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 272, "prompt_tokens": 28, "total_tokens": 300}, "time": "147.85"}

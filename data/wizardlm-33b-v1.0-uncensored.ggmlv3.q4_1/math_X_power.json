Therefore, x is approximately:\n\nx = (2.074)/(0.903) = 2.306\n\nSo the solution to the equation 8^x + 2^x = 130 is x = 2.306."}], "created": 1688383296, "id": "foobarbaz", "model": "", "object": "text_completion", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 292, "prompt_tokens": 44, "total_tokens": 336}, "time": "87.56"}

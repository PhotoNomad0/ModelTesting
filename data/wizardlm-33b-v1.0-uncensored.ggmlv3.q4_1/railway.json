The earliest railways in Britain were built with different track gauges (the distance between the rails), which caused problems when connecting lines from different companies.\n\nIn 1845, the Gauge Commission was established to determine a standard gauge for British railways. After considering various options, including the Irish gauge of 5 feet 3 inches and the Brunel gauge of 7 feet 0.25 inches, the commission recommended a gauge of 4 feet 8.5 inches (1,435 mm). This was based on the existing gauge used by the Liverpool and Manchester Railway, which had been built in 1830.\n\nThe standard gauge was adopted by most British railway companies, as well as many other countries around the world, including the United States, Canada, Australia, and New Zealand. Today, it is the most widely used track gauge in the world, with approximately 60% of the world's railways using this gauge."}], "created": 1688383209, "id": "foobarbaz", "model": "", "object": "text_completion", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 237, "prompt_tokens": 34, "total_tokens": 271}, "time": "71.43"}

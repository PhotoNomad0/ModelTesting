It is designed to understand and analyze legal language, which can be complex and nuanced. \nIn AI research, LLMs are used for various tasks such as document analysis, machine translation, and question answering. They help computers understand legal documents and communicate with lawyers in a more efficient manner. This technology has numerous applications in the legal industry, including e-discovery, contract review, and automated legal research.\nLLMs are trained on large datasets of legal texts, which allows them to learn the patterns and structures of legal language. They use this knowledge to identify key terms, phrases, and concepts within a given document or text. This makes it easier for computers to analyze and understand legal information, which can save time and reduce errors in legal processes.\nOverall, LLMs are an important tool in AI research and have the potential to revolutionize the way legal documents are analyzed and processed."}], "created": 1688991791, "id": "foobarbaz", "model": "ggml-wizardlm7B-q6_K.bin", "object": "text_completion", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 224, "prompt_tokens": 25, "total_tokens": 249}, "time": "15.48"}

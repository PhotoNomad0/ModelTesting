Help as much as you can.\n\n### User:\nexplain use of LLM's in AI research\n\n### Response:\n\n\nLLM (Legal Language Model) is a type of natural language processing (NLP) tool that is commonly used in artificial intelligence (AI) research. It is designed to analyze and understand legal language, which can be complex and difficult for computers to interpret accurately. \n\nIn AI research, LLM's are used to develop systems that can read and comprehend legal documents, such as contracts or court opinions. This is important because it allows machines to automatically extract relevant information from these documents, which can save time and reduce errors compared to manual analysis by humans.\n\nLLM's also have applications in other fields beyond law, including finance, healthcare, and education. For example, they can be used to analyze medical records or educational materials to identify patterns and trends that can inform decision-making. \n\nOverall, LLM's are an important tool for AI researchers who want to develop more advanced systems that can understand and interpret complex language and data."}], "created": 1692792101, "id": "foobarbaz", "model": "ggml-wizardlm7B-q6_K.bin", "object": "text_completion", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 207, "prompt_tokens": 64, "total_tokens": 271}, "time": "38.58"}

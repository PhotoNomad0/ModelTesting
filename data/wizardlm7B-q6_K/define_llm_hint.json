They are designed to learn from large amounts of data, such as books or articles, and use this knowledge to predict the most likely words or phrases that will come next in a sentence.\nIn AI research, LLMs are used for tasks such as natural language processing (NLP), machine translation, and text generation. They can help computers understand human language better by analyzing patterns and relationships between words and sentences. This allows them to generate more accurate translations or responses that sound like they were written by a human.\nLLMs are typically based on deep learning algorithms, which means they can learn from vast amounts of data and improve their performance over time. They require large amounts of training data and computational resources to train the models effectively. However, once trained, LLMs can be used for a wide range of applications in AI research and industry."}], "created": 1688991805, "id": "foobarbaz", "model": "ggml-wizardlm7B-q6_K.bin", "object": "text_completion", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 204, "prompt_tokens": 30, "total_tokens": 234}, "time": "13.03"}

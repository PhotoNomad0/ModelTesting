Help as much as you can.\n\n### User:\nexplain use of Large Language Models (LLM) in AI research\n\n### Response:\n\n\nSure, I'd be happy to explain the use of Large Language Models (LLM) in AI research. \n\nLarge language models are a type of artificial intelligence model that is designed to understand and generate human-like text. These models are typically based on deep neural networks and are trained using large amounts of data, which allows them to learn the patterns and structures of natural language.\n\nIn AI research, LLMs are used for a variety of tasks such as machine translation, sentiment analysis, speech recognition, and chatbots. By training these models on large datasets, researchers can improve their accuracy and effectiveness in performing these tasks. \n\nOne of the key benefits of using LLMs is that they can learn from context, which allows them to better understand the meaning of words and phrases in different situations. This makes them particularly useful for natural language processing applications where understanding the nuances of human language is critical.\n\nOverall, Large Language Models are a powerful tool for AI researchers who want to create more accurate and effective natural language processing systems."}], "created": 1692637170, "id": "foobarbaz", "model": "ggml-wizardlm7B-q6_K.bin", "object": "text_completion", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 230, "prompt_tokens": 69, "total_tokens": 299}, "time": "18.90"}

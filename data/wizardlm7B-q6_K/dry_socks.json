Help as much as you can.\n\n### User:\nTom washed 10 pairs of socks. The socks are now wet from the wash, so Tom hangs the 10 pairs of socks outside to dry. 10 hours later, he comes back outside to check on the socks. He feels each sock and notices they are all dry. He takes them back inside because they are all dry. How long will it take Tom to dry seven pairs of socks presuming the same weather conditions?\n\n### Response:\n\n\nBased on the information provided, we can assume that the time taken for one pair of socks to dry is equal to the time taken for all 10 pairs of socks to dry. Therefore, it would take Tom 10 hours to dry 10 pairs of socks. \n\nTo find out how long it will take him to dry seven pairs of socks, we can use a proportion:\n\n7/10 = x/10 (where x is the time taken to dry seven pairs)\n\nWe know that the time taken for one pair of socks to dry is 10 hours. So we can cross-multiply and simplify:\n\n7x = 10y\n\nTherefore, it will take Tom 7/10 or 3.5 hours (rounded up) to dry seven pairs of socks."}], "created": 1692637850, "id": "foobarbaz", "model": "ggml-wizardlm7B-q6_K.bin", "object": "text_completion", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 183, "prompt_tokens": 151, "total_tokens": 334}, "time": "18.25"}

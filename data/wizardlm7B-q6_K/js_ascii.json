It then logs each character's ASCII code along with its hexadecimal representation using the `.charCodeAt(0)` property and the `toHex()` method respectively. The output should look something like this:\n```\nASCII code for 0: 48\nHexadecimal code for 0: 0\nASCII code for 1: 49\nHexadecimal code for 1: 1\n...\nASCII code for 7: 52\nHexadecimal code for 7: 7f\n```"}], "created": 1688991955, "id": "foobarbaz", "model": "ggml-wizardlm7B-q6_K.bin", "object": "text_completion", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 282, "prompt_tokens": 39, "total_tokens": 321}, "time": "21.61"}

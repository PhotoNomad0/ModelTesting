Help as much as you can.\n\n### User:\ncreate a javascript function that uses regex to extract a three character code like \"1Jn\" from a filename in format \"57-1Jn.usfm\".  The characters can be upper or lower case letters or digits. And the filename extension must be \".usfm\".\n\n### Response:\n\n\nSure, here's an example JavaScript function that extracts a three character code from a filename in the format you described:\n```javascript\nfunction getCode(filename) {\n  const regex = /[a-zA-Z0-9]{3}(?=.usfm$)/;\n  const match = filename.match(regex);\n  return match ? match[0] : null;\n}\n// Example usage:\nconst filename = \"57-1Jn.usfm\";\nconst code = getCode(filename);\nconsole.log(code); // Output: \"1Jn\"\n```\nThis function uses a regular expression to match any three character sequence that ends with \".usfm\". The `(?=.usfm$)` part of the regex ensures that the match occurs only at the end of the filename, and not within another subdirectory or file name. \nThe `match` variable contains the matched text if a code is found in the filename, otherwise it will be `null`."}], "created": 1693336637, "id": "foobarbaz", "model": "ggml-wizardlm7B-q6_K.bin", "object": "text_completion", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 216, "prompt_tokens": 110, "total_tokens": 326}, "time": "18.38"}

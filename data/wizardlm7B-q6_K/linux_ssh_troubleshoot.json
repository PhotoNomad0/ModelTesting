Help as much as you can.\n\n### User:\nwhy does this command give error Permission denied (publickey):\n\nssh -i \"~/UserKey.pem\" -C -L 25900:localhost:5900 ec2-34-221-131-108.us-west-2.compute.amazonaws.com\n\n### Response:\n\n\nI'm sorry, I don't have access to your local files or your command history. However, based on the information you provided, it seems like you are trying to connect to an Amazon EC2 instance using a private key file called \"UserKey.pem\". \n\nTo allow this connection, you will need to check that:\n1. The permissions of the \"UserKey.pem\" file are set correctly for your user account on the server where the file is located.\n2. You have the necessary permissions to connect to the EC2 instance using SSH. This may require additional authentication beyond just a private key file.\n3. Your command syntax is correct and matches the specifications of your EC2 instance.\n\nI recommend checking the documentation for your EC2 instance and following the steps provided by Amazon to set up SSH access. If you are unsure how to do this, I can try to provide more guidance or assist you in contacting AWS support if necessary."}], "created": 1692792993, "id": "foobarbaz", "model": "ggml-wizardlm7B-q6_K.bin", "object": "text_completion", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 204, "prompt_tokens": 125, "total_tokens": 329}, "time": "17.86"}

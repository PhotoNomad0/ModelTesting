Help as much as you can.\n\n### User:\nIn 8^X+2^X=130 show how to solve for X\n\n### Response:\n\n\nSure, I'd be happy to help! \nTo solve for X in the equation 8^X + 2^X = 130, we can use exponent rules. \nFirst, we need to evaluate 8^X and 2^X separately. \nFor example: \n- If X = 1, then 8^X = 8 and 2^X = 2 \n- If X = 2, then 8^X = 256 and 2^X = 4 \nWe can substitute these values into the equation to get: \n8*8 + 2*4 = 130 \nSimplifying this expression gives us: \n64 + 8 = 72 \nSo, X = 2. \nTherefore, the solution for X is X = 2."}], "created": 1692792263, "id": "foobarbaz", "model": "ggml-wizardlm7B-q6_K.bin", "object": "text_completion", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 190, "prompt_tokens": 71, "total_tokens": 261}, "time": "16.66"}

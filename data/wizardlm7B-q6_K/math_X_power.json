Help as much as you can.\n\n### User:\nIn 8^X+2^X=130 show how to solve for X\n\n### Response:\n\n\nSure, I'd be happy to help!\n\nTo solve for X in the equation 8^X + 2^X = 130, we can use exponent rules. \nFirst, we need to find a common base between the two exponents. Since both 8 and 2 are powers of 2, their common base is also a power of 2. Let's call it 4. Then:\n8^X = 130 / 4^X\n2^X = 130 / 4^X\nNow we can simplify each side using exponent rules:\n8^X = (130 / 4^X)^(1/4)\n2^X = (130 / 4^X)^(1/4)\nMultiplying both sides by 4^X, we get:\n8*4^X = (130 * 4^X)/4^X\n2*4^X = (130 * 4^X)/4^X\nSimplifying further:\n8*4^X - 2*4^X = 130 / 4^X\nNow we can solve for X by isolating the variable on one side of the equation. Let's subtract 8*4^X from both sides:\n-6X = (130/4^X)\nDividing both sides by -6:\nX = (-130/-6)/(4^2)\nTaking the inverse operation of squaring and dividing by -6:\nX = 7.5\nTherefore, X = 7.5 is one solution to the equation 8^X + 2^X = 130."}], "created": 1692637341, "id": "foobarbaz", "model": "ggml-wizardlm7B-q6_K.bin", "object": "text_completion", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 381, "prompt_tokens": 71, "total_tokens": 452}, "time": "27.40"}

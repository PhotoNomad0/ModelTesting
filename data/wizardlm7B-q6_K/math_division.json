Help as much as you can.\n\n### User:\nIn the morning, Emily decided to create some designs with her cereal bits. In total, she created 9 designs and used 63 cereal bits. About how many cereal bits were in each design? Do you think she used an equal number of cereal bits in each design?\n\n### Response:\n\n\nBased on the information provided, we can calculate that Emily created 9 designs with a total of 63 cereal bits. To determine how many cereal bits were used in each design, we would need to divide the total number of cereal bits by the number of designs. However, since we do not have information on the size or shape of the designs, it is difficult to say whether Emily used an equal amount of cereal bits in each one."}], "created": 1692637252, "id": "foobarbaz", "model": "ggml-wizardlm7B-q6_K.bin", "object": "text_completion", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 100, "prompt_tokens": 117, "total_tokens": 217}, "time": "12.14"}

Help as much as you can.\n\n### User:\nIn the morning, Emily decided to create some designs with her cereal bits. In total, she created 9 designs and used 63 cereal bits. About how many cereal bits were in each design? Do you think she used an equal number of cereal bits in each design?\n\n### Response:\n\n\nBased on the information provided, we can calculate that Emily created 9 designs with a total of 63 cereal bits. To determine how many cereal bits were used in each design, we would need to know the size or weight of each bit. Without this information, it is difficult to provide an accurate answer.\n\nAs for whether or not Emily used an equal number of cereal bits in each design, we cannot make that determination based on the given data. It is possible that she did use an equal amount in each design, but without further information, we cannot be certain."}], "created": 1692792210, "id": "foobarbaz", "model": "ggml-wizardlm7B-q6_K.bin", "object": "text_completion", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 127, "prompt_tokens": 117, "total_tokens": 244}, "time": "13.62"}

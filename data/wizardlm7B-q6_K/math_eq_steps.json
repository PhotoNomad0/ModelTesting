The first operation is the multiplication of 4 and 2, which gives us 8. Then, we add 3 to 8, which gives us 11. Finally, we subtract 25 from 11, which gives us 9 as the final answer."}], "created": 1688992175, "id": "foobarbaz", "model": "ggml-wizardlm7B-q6_K.bin", "object": "text_completion", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 131, "prompt_tokens": 31, "total_tokens": 162}, "time": "78.04"}

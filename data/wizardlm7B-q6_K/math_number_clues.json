Help as much as you can.\n\nUser:\nI am not a prime number.\nI am between 20 and 40.\nI am one more than a square number. What number am I?\n\nAssistant:Based on the given information, we know that you are an integer between 20 and 40, and one more than a square number. We can use trial and error to find out what number you could be. Let's start with the smallest possible value for the square of a two-digit number: 10^2 = 100. The next highest number that is one more than 100 is 101, which means your number must be between 30 and 50 (inclusive). Therefore, you are likely an integer between 30 and 49."}], "created": 1692637385, "id": "foobarbaz", "model": "ggml-wizardlm7B-q6_K.bin", "object": "text_completion", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 193, "prompt_tokens": 87, "total_tokens": 280}, "time": "16.93"}

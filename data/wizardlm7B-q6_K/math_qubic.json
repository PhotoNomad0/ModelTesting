Help as much as you can.\n\n### User:\nin ax^3+bx^2+c*x+d=0, use the cardano's formula to get the value for x where a=1, b=0, c=1 and d=-130\n\n### Response:\n\n\nSure! To find the roots of the equation ax^3 + bx^2 + cx + d = 0 using Cardano's formula, we need to solve for x as follows:\n\na_n = -b/3\n\nc_1 = (d + b^2)/9\n\nc_2 = -(b^3)/54 + c_1\n\nx = (-b^2 + 9(c_1 + c_2))/(6*a)\n\nNow, let's plug in the given values of a=1, b=0, c=1 and d=-130:\n\n-b/3 = -1\n\nc_1 = (130 + 0^2)/9 = 15\n\nc_2 = -(0^3)/54 + 15 = -78\n\nx = (-0^2 + 9(15) + (-78))/(6*1) = -2.282\n\nTherefore, the root of the equation is approximately x=-2.282."}], "created": 1692792364, "id": "foobarbaz", "model": "ggml-wizardlm7B-q6_K.bin", "object": "text_completion", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 241, "prompt_tokens": 101, "total_tokens": 342}, "time": "20.13"}

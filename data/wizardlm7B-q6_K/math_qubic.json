Help as much as you can.\n\n### User:\nin ax^3+bx^2+c*x+d=0, use the cardano's formula to get the value for x where a=1, b=0, c=1 and d=-130\n\n### Response:\n\n\nSure! To find the roots of the equation ax^3 + bx^2 + cx + d = 0 using Cardano's formula, we need to first calculate the discriminant (d) and determine if it is positive or negative. In this case, d = -130 is a negative number.\n\nIf d is negative, we can use the following formulas:\n\n- If b^2 + 4ac < 0, then the roots are real and distinct. We can find them using the quadratic formula: x = (-b \u00b1 sqrt(b^2 - 4ac)) / 2a.\n- If b^2 + 4ac > 0, then the roots are repeated. We can still find one of the roots by setting b = 0 and solving for x in the equation ax^3 + c = 0. The other root will be -x/3.\n\nIn this case, a = 1, b = 0, and c = 1. So we have:\n\n- If d is negative and b^2 + 4ac < 0, then the roots are real and distinct. We can find them using the quadratic formula: x = (-b \u00b1 sqrt(b^2 - 4ac)) / 2a = (-1 \u00b1 sqrt(1^2 - 4(1)(-130))) / 2 * 1 = -(-117 +/- sqrt(589))/2\n   or x = -x/3 = -117/3.\n\nTherefore, the roots of the equation are:\n\nx_1 = -117/3 and x_2 = -117/3"}], "created": 1692637559, "id": "foobarbaz", "model": "ggml-wizardlm7B-q6_K.bin", "object": "text_completion", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 376, "prompt_tokens": 101, "total_tokens": 477}, "time": "27.53"}

Find the discriminant (b^2 - 4ac) and determine if it is positive or negative. If it is positive, then there are two real roots. If it is negative, then there is one real root and one complex root. If it is zero, then there are three real roots.\n2. If the discriminant is positive, use the quadratic formula to find the two possible values of x where a = 1, b = 0, c = 1, and d = -130.\na^2 + b^2 - 4ac = (1)^2 + (0)^2 - 4(1)(-130) = 976\nx = (-b \u00b1 sqrt(b^2 - 4ac)) / 2a\nx = (-130 \u00b1 sqrt((130^2 - 4(1)(-130))) / (2*1)\nx = (-130 \u00b1 sqrt(-5769)) / 2\nx = (-130 \u00b1 sqrt(827)) / 2\nThe two possible values of x are:\nx_1 = -4.54 and x_2 = 0.54\nTherefore, the roots of the equation ax^3 + bx^2 + cx + d = 0 are x_1 = -4.54 and x_2 = 0.54."}], "created": 1688992366, "id": "foobarbaz", "model": "ggml-wizardlm7B-q6_K.bin", "object": "text_completion", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 361, "prompt_tokens": 62, "total_tokens": 423}, "time": "83.62"}

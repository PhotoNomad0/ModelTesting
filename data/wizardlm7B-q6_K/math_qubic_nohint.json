Help as much as you can.\n\n### User:\nin x^3+x-130=0, solve for the value for x\n\n### Response:\n\n\nSure! We can solve this equation using the quadratic formula:\n\nx = (-b \u00b1 sqrt(b^2 - 4ac)) / 2a\n\nIn this case, a = 1, b = -130, and c = x. So we have:\n\nx = (-(-130) \u00b1 sqrt((-130)^2 - 4(1)(x))) / 2(1)\n\nSimplifying the expression under the square root:\n\nx = (130 \u00b1 sqrt(8796 + 4x)) / 2\n\nNow we can solve for x using a calculator or by simplifying further:\n\nx = (130 \u00b1 sqrt(8856 + 4x)) / 2\n\nx = (130 \u00b1 sqrt(9716 - 4x)) / 2\n\nx = (130 \u00b1 sqrt(4x^2 - 4*(-130))) / 2\n\nx = (130 \u00b1 sqrt((-130)^2 + 8x^2)) / 2\n\nTherefore, the solutions for x are:\n\nx = (-130 \u00b1 sqrt(5764 - 8x^2)) / (2*130)"}], "created": 1692637636, "id": "foobarbaz", "model": "ggml-wizardlm7B-q6_K.bin", "object": "text_completion", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 304, "prompt_tokens": 71, "total_tokens": 375}, "time": "30.98"}

Help as much as you can.\n\n### User:\nin x^3+x-130=0, solve for the value for x\n\n### Response:\n\n\nSure! \nTo solve for x in the equation x^3 + x - 130 = 0, we can use the quadratic formula. \n\nThe quadratic formula is:\nx = (-b \u00b1 sqrt(b^2 - 4ac)) / 2a\n\nIn this case, a = 1, b = 3 (since it's a cubic equation), and c = -130. So we have:\n\nx = (-3 \u00b1 sqrt(3^2 - 4(1)(-130))) / 2(1)\nx = (-3 \u00b1 sqrt(978)) / 2\n\nSimplifying the expression under the square root:\n\nx = (-3 \u00b1 sqrt(506)) / 2\nx = (-3 \u00b1 sqrt(49)) / 2\n\nTherefore, the two solutions for x are:\n\n-x = -1.87 or x = 0.87"}], "created": 1692792428, "id": "foobarbaz", "model": "ggml-wizardlm7B-q6_K.bin", "object": "text_completion", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 224, "prompt_tokens": 71, "total_tokens": 295}, "time": "18.60"}

The quadratic formula is:\nx = (-b \u00b1 sqrt(b^2 - 4ac)) / 2a\nwhere a = 1, b = -130, and c = x.\nSubstituting these values into the formula, we get:\nx = (-(-130) \u00b1 sqrt((-130)^2 - 4(1)(x))) / 2(1)\nSimplifying this expression gives us:\nx = (130 \u00b1 sqrt(169 + 8x)) / 2\nWe can solve for x by taking the square root of both sides and simplifying:\nx = (130 \u00b1 sqrt(177 + 4x)) / 2\nx = (130 \u00b1 sqrt(181 + 4x)) / 2\nSimplifying further, we get:\nx = (130 \u00b1 sqrt(5x - 64)) / 2\nNow we can solve for x by taking the square root of both sides and simplifying:\nx = (130 \u00b1 sqrt(5x - 64)) / 2\nx = (130 \u00b1 sqrt((5x + 64) / 2)) / 2\nSimplifying further, we get:\nx = (130 \u00b1 sqrt(7x + 8)) / 2\nTherefore, the solutions for x are:\nx = (-130 + sqrt(7x + 8)) / 2 and x = (130 - sqrt(7x + 8)) / 2"}], "created": 1690456173, "id": "foobarbaz", "model": "ggml-wizardlm7B-q6_K.bin", "object": "text_completion", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 396, "prompt_tokens": 32, "total_tokens": 428}, "time": "50.15"}

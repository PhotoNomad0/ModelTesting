To find the roots of the equation x^3 + x - 130 = 0 using Cardano's formula, we need to solve for the values of a and b in the quadratic equation:\na(x^2 + bx + c) = 0\nwhere a = 1/4, b = -5/4, and c = 7/4.\nWe can then use the discriminant (b^2 - 4ac) to determine whether there is one real root or two complex roots. In this case, the discriminant is -96.\nIf the discriminant is positive, there is one real root. If it is zero, there are two complex roots. And if it is negative, there are two real roots of equal absolute value.\nUsing Cardano's formula, we can find the values of a and b by solving for them in terms of x:\na = 1/4\nb = -5/4\nc = 7/4 + (x^2 + x)/(2sqrt(96))\nWe can then substitute these values into the original equation to get:\nx^3 + x - 130 = 0\nx^3 + x - 130 = 0\n(x+5)(x^2-8) = 0\nTherefore, the roots of the equation are x = -5 and x = 8."}], "created": 1688992436, "id": "foobarbaz", "model": "ggml-wizardlm7B-q6_K.bin", "object": "text_completion", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 310, "prompt_tokens": 39, "total_tokens": 349}, "time": "69.65"}

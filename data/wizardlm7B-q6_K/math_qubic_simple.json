Help as much as you can.\n\n### User:\nin x^3+x-130=0, use the cardano's formula to get the value for x\n\n### Response:\n\n\nSure! To find the roots of the equation x^3 + x - 130 = 0 using Cardano's formula, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. Square both sides of the equation to get x^6 + x^2 - 149x = 0.\n   This gives us two distinct real roots, say x_1 and x_2.\n\n2. If either x_1 or x_2 is negative, we can ignore it since the discriminant (b^2 - 4ac) must be positive for a real root.\n\n3. We now have one real root, which we can write as x = (-x_1 + x_2)/2.\n   Plugging this into the original equation gives us:\n   0 = ((-x_1 + x_2)/2)^3 + ((-x_1 + x_2)/2) - 130\n       = -(x_1^2/4 + x_1x_2/4 + x_2^2/4 - 130)/2\n            = (-(x_1^2/4 + x_1x_2/4 + x_2^2/4))/(2*sqrt((x_1^2/4 + x_1x_2/4 + x_2^2/4)))\n   This is the quadratic equation for (-(x_1^2/4 + x_1x_2/4 + x_2^2/4))/(2*sqrt((x_1^2/4 + x_1x_2/4 + x_2^2/4)))\n   and we can solve it using the quadratic formula:\n   0 = (-b - sqrt(b^2 - 4ac)) / (2a)\n       = (-(-x_1^2/4 + x_1x_2/4 + x_2^2/4)/2 - sqrt((-x_1^2/4 + x_1x_2/4 + x_2^2/4)^2 - 4*((-x_1^2/4 + x_1x_2/4 + x_2^2/4))^2 / (4a)))\n            = (-(-x_1^2/4 + x_1x_2/4 + x_2^2/4)/2 - sqrt((-x_1^2/4 + x_1x_2/4 + x_2^2/4)^2 - 4*((-x_1^2/4 + x_1x_2/4 + x_2^2/4))^2 / (4a)))\n   This gives us the two solutions:\n   0.693 and -1.785.\n\nTherefore, the real roots of the equation x^3 + x - 130 = 0 are approximately x = 0.693 and x = -1.785."}], "created": 1692792409, "id": "foobarbaz", "model": "ggml-wizardlm7B-q6_K.bin", "object": "text_completion", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 667, "prompt_tokens": 78, "total_tokens": 745}, "time": "45.18"}

Help as much as you can.\n\n### User:\nHarmony used discarded paper to make notepads for her friends. She would fold five letter size pieces of paper three times then cut along the lines. She would then stack the smaller note papers and staple them together. How long would one notepad last if someone wrote ten notes per day?\n\n### Response:\n\n\nBased on an average of 250 words per note, each notepad can hold up to 1750 words or about 6 pages. If Harmony's friends write for approximately 3 hours a day (10 notes x 3 hours = 30 hours), they would be able to use one notepad in around 3 days (6 pages / day x 3 days = 18 pages). Therefore, if each note is written on both sides, the notepad can hold up to approximately 3600 words or 14 pages."}], "created": 1692637225, "id": "foobarbaz", "model": "ggml-wizardlm7B-q6_K.bin", "object": "text_completion", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 124, "prompt_tokens": 117, "total_tokens": 241}, "time": "13.57"}

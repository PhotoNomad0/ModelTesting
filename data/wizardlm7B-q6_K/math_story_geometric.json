She would fold five letter size pieces of paper three times then cut along the lines. She would then stack the smaller note papers and staple them together. How long would one notepad last if someone wrote ten notes per day?\nIf Harmony made a notepad with 150 sheets (50 sheets for each of five sections), and each sheet can hold up to 20 lines, then the notepad can hold up to 3,000 lines. If someone writes ten notes per day on average, they would use about 300 lines per month or 180 notes in a month (assuming each note is one line). Therefore, one notepad could last for approximately two months if used consistently every day."}], "created": 1688991874, "id": "foobarbaz", "model": "ggml-wizardlm7B-q6_K.bin", "object": "text_completion", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 111, "prompt_tokens": 78, "total_tokens": 189}, "time": "12.64"}

Help as much as you can.\n\n### User:\nHarmony used discarded paper to make notepads for her friends. She would fold five letter size pieces of paper three times then cut along the lines. She would then stack the smaller note papers and staple them together. How long would one notepad last if someone wrote ten notes per day?\n\n### Response:\n\n\nBased on an average of 250 words per note, each notepad could hold up to 3,750 words or about 14 pages. If Harmony's friends used the notepads for an average of two weeks before discarding them, they would have a total of 28 days (two weeks x 7 days). Therefore, one notepad could last approximately 28/14 = 2.09 days or about 5.63 notes per day if each note is written for the full two weeks."}], "created": 1692792188, "id": "foobarbaz", "model": "ggml-wizardlm7B-q6_K.bin", "object": "text_completion", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 119, "prompt_tokens": 117, "total_tokens": 236}, "time": "13.16"}

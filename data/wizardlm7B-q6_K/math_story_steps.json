The first experiment required 2 test tubes and the other two experiments required the same number of test tubes. How many test tubes were needed for each of the other two experiments?\n\n### Response:\n\n\nBased on the information provided, we can deduce that Sara needs a total of 8 test tubes for her three different experiments. Since one experiment required 2 test tubes and the other two experiments required the same number of test tubes, we know that each of the other two experiments requires 2 test tubes as well. Therefore, Sara would need a total of 4 additional test tubes to complete her experiments."}], "created": 1692637212, "id": "foobarbaz", "model": "ggml-wizardlm7B-q6_K.bin", "object": "text_completion", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 90, "prompt_tokens": 108, "total_tokens": 198}, "time": "11.40"}

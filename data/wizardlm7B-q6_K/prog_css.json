Help as much as you can.\n\n### User:\nHow do you align a row of divs to the right using flex in css?  Show me an example.\n\n### Response:\n\n\nSure, here's an example code snippet that demonstrates how to align a row of divs to the right using flexbox in CSS:\n```css\n.row {\n  display: flex;\n  flex-direction: column;\n}\n.col-md-6 {\n  width: 50%;\n  margin-left: -12px; /* Add negative left margin to center the div */\n}\n@media (max-width: 768px) {\n  .col-md-6 {\n    width: 100%;\n  }\n}\n```\nIn this example, we create a `.row` class that uses flexbox to align its child elements (`.col-md-6`) to the right. The `flex-direction: column;` property sets the direction of the flexbox as horizontal (column), and the `width: 50%;` property sets the width of each div to half of the parent element's width.\nThe negative left margin of `.col-md-6` centers the child elements within their parent row. The `@media (max-width: 768px)` rule is used for smaller screens, where we set the `width: 100%;` property to ensure that each div takes up the full width of its container.\nI hope this helps! Let me know if you have any other questions."}], "created": 1692793016, "id": "foobarbaz", "model": "ggml-wizardlm7B-q6_K.bin", "object": "text_completion", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 300, "prompt_tokens": 74, "total_tokens": 374}, "time": "22.84"}

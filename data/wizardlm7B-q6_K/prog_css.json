Help as much as you can.\n\n### User:\nHow do you align a row of divs to the right using flex in css?  Show me an example.\n\n### Response:\n\n\nSure, here's an example code snippet that demonstrates how to align a row of divs to the right using flexbox in CSS:\n```css\n.flex-container {\n  display: flex;\n  flex-direction: column; /* change this to row for horizontal alignment */\n}\n.flex-child {\n  width: 100px;\n  height: 100px;\n  background-color: blue;\n}\n```\nIn the above code, we have a container class called `.flex-container` that is set to use flexbox by setting `display: flex`. We then change the direction of the flexbox from column (`flex-direction: column`) to row (`flex-direction: row`) using the CSS shorthand.\nNext, we create a child class called `.flex-child` with a width and height of 100px and a blue background color. We then place as many `.flex-child` elements inside the `.flex-container` as needed to fill it horizontally.\nThis will result in each `.flex-child` element being placed next to each other vertically, with no spacing between them. To add horizontal spacing, you can use CSS properties like `margin-left: 10px;` or `padding-left: 20px;`."}], "created": 1692638327, "id": "foobarbaz", "model": "ggml-wizardlm7B-q6_K.bin", "object": "text_completion", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 284, "prompt_tokens": 74, "total_tokens": 358}, "time": "22.14"}

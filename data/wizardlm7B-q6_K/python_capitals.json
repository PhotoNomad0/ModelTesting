Help as much as you can.\n\n### User:\nPython program\nWrite a function named capital_indexes. The function takes a single parameter, which is a string. Your function should return a list of all the indexes in the string that have capital letters\n\n### Response:\n\n\nSure! Here's an example code for the `capital_indexes` function in Python:\n```python\ndef capital_indexes(string):\n    return [i for i, char in enumerate(string) if char.isupper()]\n```\nThis function uses a list comprehension to create a new list containing only the indexes of characters that are uppercase letters. The `enumerate` function is used to iterate over each character and its corresponding index in the string. The `isupper()` method checks if the character is an uppercase letter, and only includes it in the list if it returns `True`.\nYou can call this function by passing a string as an argument:\n```python\nstring = \"Hello World\"\ncapital_indexes(string) # Output: [0, 2, 5]\n```\nThis will return a list of all the indexes in the string that have capital letters. In this case, it's `[0, 2, 5]` because the first character is uppercase (`H`), as are the second and fifth characters (`W` and `!`)."}], "created": 1692792470, "id": "foobarbaz", "model": "ggml-wizardlm7B-q6_K.bin", "object": "text_completion", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 236, "prompt_tokens": 93, "total_tokens": 329}, "time": "19.40"}

The `not` operator is used to exclude empty strings from the list. \nYou can call this function by passing in a list of strings as an argument:\n```python\nmy_list = ['', 'hello', '', 'world']\nfiltered_list = filter_empty(my_list)\nprint(filtered_list) # Output: ['hello', 'world']\n``` \nLet me know if you have any other questions or tasks for me."}], "created": 1692792542, "id": "foobarbaz", "model": "ggml-wizardlm7B-q6_K.bin", "object": "text_completion", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 174, "prompt_tokens": 68, "total_tokens": 242}, "time": "15.67"}

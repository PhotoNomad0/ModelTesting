Help as much as you can.\n\n### User:\nwrite a Python function to do a case insensitive sort of a list of strings\n\n### Response:\n\n\nSure, here's a Python function that does a case-insensitive sort of a list of strings using the built-in `sorted()` method with the `key` argument set to a lambda function that converts each string to lowercase before comparing them:\n\n```python\ndef case_insensitive_sort(list_of_strings):\n    sorted_list = sorted(list_of_strings, key=lambda x: x.lower())\n    return sorted_list\n```\n\nThis function takes in a list of strings as an argument and returns the same list after it has been sorted case-insensitively using the `key` parameter of the `sorted()` method. The lambda function converts each string to lowercase before comparing them, so that uppercase and lowercase letters are treated equally during sorting."}], "created": 1692637733, "id": "foobarbaz", "model": "ggml-wizardlm7B-q6_K.bin", "object": "text_completion", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 174, "prompt_tokens": 69, "total_tokens": 243}, "time": "15.71"}

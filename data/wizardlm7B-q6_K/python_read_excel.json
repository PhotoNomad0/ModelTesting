You can modify this code to read data from different cells or sheets as per your requirements."}], "created": 1689002362, "id": "foobarbaz", "model": "ggml-wizardlm7B-q6_K.bin", "object": "text_completion", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 178, "prompt_tokens": 25, "total_tokens": 203}, "time": "11.24"}

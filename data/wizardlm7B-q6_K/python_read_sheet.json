Help as much as you can.\n\n### User:\nwrite a python function to read from a spreadsheet\n\n### Response:\n\n\nSure, here's an example Python function that reads data from a CSV file:\n```python\nimport csv\ndef read_csv(file_path):\n    with open(file_path, 'r') as f:\n        reader = csv.reader(f)\n        next(reader) # skip header row\n        for row in reader:\n            print(row)\n```\nThis function takes a file path as an argument and reads the contents of the CSV file at that location. It uses the `csv` module to parse the data, skipping the first row (which is assumed to be the column headers). The `next()` function is used to move past the header row, and then the `for` loop iterates over each row in the file, printing it out. \nYou can customize this function by changing the file path argument or modifying the print statement to suit your needs."}], "created": 1692637761, "id": "foobarbaz", "model": "ggml-wizardlm7B-q6_K.bin", "object": "text_completion", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 191, "prompt_tokens": 62, "total_tokens": 253}, "time": "16.25"}

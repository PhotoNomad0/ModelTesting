The `+ \"\"` part at the beginning of the string adds an extra space before the first comma, while the `+ \"0\" * (3 - len(str(num))` part adds zeros after the last digit of the number to create a thousands separator. \nYou can call this function like so:\n```python\n>>> format_number(12345)\n'123,450'\n```"}], "created": 1693567558, "id": "foobarbaz", "model": "ggml-wizardlm7B-q6_K.bin", "object": "text_completion", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 174, "prompt_tokens": 87, "total_tokens": 261}, "time": "35.06"}

Help as much as you can.\n\n### User:\nExplain origin of standard gauge for railways\n\n### Response:\n\n\nThe standard gauge for railway is a track width of 1435mm (4 ft 8 in) which was first established by the Great Western Railway in Britain in the mid-19th century. The reason behind this decision was to create a uniform size for railway tracks that would allow for easier interchangeability of rolling stock and infrastructure across different rail networks.\n\nThe standard gauge quickly became adopted by other countries around the world, including the United States, Canada, Australia, and most of Europe. Today, it is one of the most widely used track gauges in the world, with only a few minor variations in some parts of Asia and Africa. \n\nOverall, the standard gauge has allowed for greater efficiency and interoperability in railway transportation, making it an essential component of global trade and commerce."}], "created": 1692637314, "id": "foobarbaz", "model": "ggml-wizardlm7B-q6_K.bin", "object": "text_completion", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 170, "prompt_tokens": 61, "total_tokens": 231}, "time": "43.88"}

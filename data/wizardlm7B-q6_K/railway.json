The width of the track was initially determined by the size of the wheels on locomotives at the time, which varied depending on the region. However, as more countries began to adopt standardized track gauges, it became necessary to establish a universal standard.\n\nIn 1857, the International Union of Railways (UIC) established a convention that recommended a standard gauge of 4 feet and 8.5 inches (1.435 meters). This was based on the width of the wheels used by the majority of locomotives at the time.\n\nSince then, many countries have adopted this standard gauge for their railways, making it easier to transport goods and people across borders. The UIC continues to oversee the standardization of track gauges around the world, ensuring that trains can operate seamlessly between different networks."}], "created": 1692792246, "id": "foobarbaz", "model": "ggml-wizardlm7B-q6_K.bin", "object": "text_completion", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 206, "prompt_tokens": 61, "total_tokens": 267}, "time": "17.14"}

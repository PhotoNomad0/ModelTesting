Help as much as you can.\n\n### User:\nwhen I was 6, my sister was half my age. Now I am 80. How old is my sister now? Calculate this step by step.\n\n### Response:\n\n\nSure! Let's break it down step-by-step:\n\n1. When you were 6, your sister was half your age (assuming you are a female and your sister is also a female).\n2. Now that you are 80, your sister would have been twice her age when she was half yours.\n3. Therefore, your sister's current age can be calculated by multiplying the number of years that have passed since she was half your age (which is the difference between your ages) by two.\n4. Let's assume your sister was half your age for 20 years. Then you would have been 6 + 20 = 26, and now you are 80 - 26 = 54.\n5. Therefore, your sister's current age can be calculated as follows: \n   (now - then) x 2 = (54 - 26) x 2 = 192\n   So your sister is currently 192 years old."}], "created": 1692637189, "id": "foobarbaz", "model": "ggml-wizardlm7B-q6_K.bin", "object": "text_completion", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 223, "prompt_tokens": 86, "total_tokens": 309}, "time": "19.00"}

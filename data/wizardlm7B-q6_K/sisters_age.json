Calculate this step by step.\nSure! Let's break it down step-by-step:\n1. When you were 6 years old, your sister was half your age. To find out how old she was at that time, we need to divide your current age (80) by 2. \n   - 80 / 2 = 40\n2. Your sister's age now is the same as it was when you were 6 years old. So, we can substitute the value of her age from step 1 into this equation:\n   40 = (your sister's age) x 2 + y\n   where y is some unknown variable.\n3. We need to isolate your sister's age on one side of the equation so that we can solve for it. Let's simplify the left-hand side of the equation:\n   40 = (your sister's age) x 2 + y\n   - 40 = 2x + y\n   - 8 = 2x\n   x = 4\n   So, your sister was 4 years old when you were 6.\nTherefore, now that you are 80 and your sister is 4, her age is 80 - 4 = 76."}], "created": 1688991826, "id": "foobarbaz", "model": "ggml-wizardlm7B-q6_K.bin", "object": "text_completion", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 273, "prompt_tokens": 47, "total_tokens": 320}, "time": "21.02"}

Help as much as you can.\n\n### User:\nwhen I was 6, my sister was half my age. Now I am 80. How old is my sister now?\n\n### Response:\n\n\nSure! Let me do the calculation for you. Your sister's age can be found by subtracting your current age (which is 80) from her half-age (which was 30 when you were 6, and now would be 15). Therefore, your sister's age is:\n\n(current age - half-age) = (80 - 15) = 65\n\nSo, your sister's current age is 65."}], "created": 1692637200, "id": "foobarbaz", "model": "ggml-wizardlm7B-q6_K.bin", "object": "text_completion", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 104, "prompt_tokens": 79, "total_tokens": 183}, "time": "11.82"}

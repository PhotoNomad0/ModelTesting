Explain your answer\nBased on the information given, we can set up a equation to solve for the number of sisters that Sally has:\n(number of brothers) x (number of sisters per brother) + (number of sisters) = (total number of siblings)\nWe know that Sally has 3 brothers and her brothers have 2 sisters each, so we can substitute those values into the equation:\n(3) x (2) + (2) = (6)\nSimplifying the equation, we get:\n6 + 2 = 8\nSo, Sally has 8/2 or 4 sisters."}], "created": 1690456123, "id": "foobarbaz", "model": "ggml-wizardlm7B-q6_K.bin", "object": "text_completion", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 136, "prompt_tokens": 41, "total_tokens": 177}, "time": "22.63"}

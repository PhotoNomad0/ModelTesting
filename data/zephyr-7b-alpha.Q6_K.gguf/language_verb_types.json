Here are some common verb categories:\n\n1. Finite verbs: These are the most common type of verb and they have a subject, tense, and agreement with the subject. For example: \"I run,\" \"She sings,\" \"They dance.\"\n\n2. Non-finite verbs: These do not have a subject or tense and usually appear in forms such as infinitives (to + base form of verb), gerunds (-ing form of verb), or participles (verb + -ed or -ing). For example: \"To run,\" \"Running,\" \"Ran.\"\n\n3. Linking verbs: These connect a subject to a predicate that describes it. They do not change the subject's state, but rather describe it. Examples include \"is,\" \"are,\" \"was,\" and \"were.\" For example: \"She is happy\" or \"They were tired.\"\n\n4. Helping verbs: These are auxiliary verbs that help to form other verb tenses, aspects, or moods. They usually appear before the main verb in a sentence. Examples include \"do,\" \"have,\" and \"can.\" For example: \"I have finished my work\" or \"They could not find their keys.\"\n\n5. Modal verbs: These are auxiliary verbs that indicate possibility, probability, obligation, or permission. They usually appear before the main verb in a sentence. Examples include \"may,\" \"might,\" \"must,\" and \"shall.\" For example: \"She may go to the concert\" or \"We must finish our work by Friday.\"\n\n6. Emphatic verbs: These are auxiliary verbs that add emphasis to the main verb. They usually appear before the main verb in a sentence. Examples include \"let,\" \"make,\" and \"help.\" For example: \"Let her go\" or \"Make them wait.\"\n\n7. Causative verbs: These are verbs that cause something to happen. They can be formed by adding \"cause\" or \"make\" before the main verb. Examples include \"cause\" or \"make.\" For example: \"He made me laugh\" or \"She caused the accident.\"\n\n8. Passive verbs: These are verbs that describe an action being done to a subject rather than by it. They can be formed by adding \"be\" + past participle of the main verb. Examples include \"is,\" \"are,\" and \"was.\" For example: \"The cake was eaten by the children\" or \"The book is written by her.\"\n\n9. Intransitive verbs: These are verbs that do not take a direct object. They can be used to describe actions, states, or sensations. Examples include \"jump,\" \"sing,\" and \"feel.\" For example: \"She jumped over the fence\" or \"He feels tired.\"\n\n10. Transitive verbs: These are verbs that take a direct object. They can be used to describe actions that result in something happening. Examples include \"hit,\" \"write,\" and \"eat.\" For example: \"He hit the ball\" or \"She wrote a letter.\""}, "finish_reason": "stop"}], "usage": {"prompt_tokens": 0, "completion_tokens": 687, "total_tokens": 687}, "time": "37.41"}

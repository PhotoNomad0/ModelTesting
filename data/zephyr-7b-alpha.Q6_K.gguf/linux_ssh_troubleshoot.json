This could be due to a number of reasons:\n\n1. The private key file specified (-i) is not in the correct location or has an incorrect name.\n\n2. The private key file does not have the appropriate permissions (usually 600 for security).\n\n3. The public key that was added to the remote server's authorized_keys file does not match the private key being used on the local machine.\n\n4. There is a network issue between the local and remote machines preventing the authentication process from completing.\n\nTo troubleshoot this error, you can try the following:\n\n1. Verify that the private key file exists in the specified location (~/UserKey.pem) and that it has the correct permissions (600).\n\n2. Check the authorized_keys file on the remote server to ensure that the public key matches the private key being used on the local machine.\n\n3. If you are using a firewall or proxy, make sure that it is configured to allow SSH traffic through.\n\n4. Try connecting to a different remote server with SSH to rule out network issues.\n\n5. Check the SSH configuration files (~/.ssh/config) on both the local and remote machines for any syntax errors or incorrect settings."}, "finish_reason": "stop"}], "usage": {"prompt_tokens": 0, "completion_tokens": 306, "total_tokens": 306}, "time": "16.89"}

This is done by adding and subtracting a term inside the square root in the following way:\n\nax^3 + bx^2 + cx + d = 0\na(x^3 + (b/a)x^2) + c(x + (d/c)) - (bd/ac)^2/4a + d^2/c^2 = 0\n\nTo simplify the equation, let:\nu = x + (d/c)\nv = (b/a)\nq = (-bd/ac)^2/4a\n\nThen, we can rewrite the equation as:\nau^3 + q - (du/c)^2 = 0\n\nTo find the roots of this cubic equation using Cardano's formula, we need to solve for u in terms of q and a. This is done by setting up the following equation:\n\nu = (-q \u00b1 sqrt(q^3 + 27a^2du^4))/2a\n\nTo find the value of x, we can substitute this back into our original equation:\n\nx = u - (d/c)\n\nIn your case, a=1, b=0, c=1 and d=-130. So, let's plug these values in:\n\nu = (-q \u00b1 sqrt(q^3 + 27a^2du^4))/2a\nq = (b/a)^2/4a = 0\nd/c = -130/1 = -130\n\nSo, we get:\n\nu = (-0 \u00b1 sqrt(0^3 + 27*1^2*(x+(-130/1))^4))/2*1\n\nSimplifying this expression gives:\n\nx = u - (-130/1)\nx = (-q \u00b1 sqrt(q^3 + 27a^2du^4))/2a - 130\n\nSubstituting back in the values we found for q, a, d and c:\n\nx = (-0 \u00b1 sqrt(0^3 + 27*1^2*(u+130)^4))/(2*1) - 130\n\nWe can't solve for u using this formula as the value of q is zero. This means that the original equation has no real roots."}, "finish_reason": "stop"}], "usage": {"prompt_tokens": 0, "completion_tokens": 576, "total_tokens": 576}, "time": "33.37"}

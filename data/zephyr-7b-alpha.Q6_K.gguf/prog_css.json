Set the parent container's display property to `flex`.\n2. Set the flex-direction property to `row-reverse`.\n3. Set the justify-content property to `space-between` or `flex-end` to distribute space between the items and align them to the right.\n\nHere's an example:\n\nHTML:\n\n```html\n<div class=\"parent\">\n  <div>Item 1</div>\n  <div>Item 2</div>\n  <div>Item 3</div>\n</div>\n```\n\nCSS:\n\n```css\n.parent {\n  display: flex;\n  flex-direction: row-reverse;\n  justify-content: space-between;\n}\n```\n\nIn this example, the `parent` container's `flex-direction` is set to `row-reverse`, which will reverse the order of the items in the container. The `justify-content` property is set to `space-between` to distribute space between the items and align them to the right."}, "finish_reason": "stop"}], "usage": {"prompt_tokens": 0, "completion_tokens": 257, "total_tokens": 257}, "time": "14.27"}

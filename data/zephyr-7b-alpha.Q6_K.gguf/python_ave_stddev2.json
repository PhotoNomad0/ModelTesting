To calculate the variance and standard deviation, we first calculate the difference between each number and the mean (i.e., `x - avg`), square those differences, add them up, and then divide by `n-1`. Finally, we take the square root to get the standard deviation.\n\nNote that the formula for variance uses `(n-1)` instead of `n`, because this is the formula for unbiased estimation of population variance (i.e., when you're working with a sample). If you're working with the entire population, you can use `n` instead of `n-1`.\n\nAlso note that we handle the case where the input list is empty by returning `None` for both the mean and standard deviation."}, "finish_reason": "stop"}], "usage": {"prompt_tokens": 0, "completion_tokens": 356, "total_tokens": 356}, "time": "19.17"}

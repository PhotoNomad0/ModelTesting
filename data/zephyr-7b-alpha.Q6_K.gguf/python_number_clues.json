For each number `i`, we check if it's one more than a square number. We do this by checking if `(i-1)**2` is equal to an integer. If it is, we proceed to check whether `i` is prime or not.\n\nTo check whether `i` is prime, we use the Sieve of Eratosthenes algorithm. We iterate through all numbers from 2 up to the square root of `i`. For each number `d`, we check if `i` is divisible by `d`. If it is, we skip over `i` and move on to the next iteration.\n\nIf `i` passes both checks (i.e., it's one more than a square number and it's prime), then we print out its value as the answer to the problem."}, "finish_reason": "stop"}], "usage": {"prompt_tokens": 0, "completion_tokens": 310, "total_tokens": 310}, "time": "16.89"}

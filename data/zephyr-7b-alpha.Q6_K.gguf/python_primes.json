It does so by iterating over all numbers from 2 up to the square root of `n`, checking if any of them divide `n` evenly. If one such divisor is found, then `n` is not prime and we return `False`. Otherwise, we return `True`.\n\nThe main program uses a while loop to generate 100 primes using the `is_prime` function. It starts by initializing an empty list `primes`, and then sets a counter variable `i` to 2. Inside the while loop, it checks whether the length of `primes` is still less than 100 (i.e., we haven't found enough primes yet). If so, it calls `is_prime` with `i`, and if the result is `True`, then it appends `i` to `primes`. Finally, after generating all 100 primes, the program prints them out using a for loop.\n\nNote that this implementation has a time complexity of O(n^2) due to the nested loops. This can be improved by using more sophisticated algorithms like Sieve of Eratosthenes or Miller-Rabin primality test. However, those are beyond the scope of this task and would require more advanced programming skills."}, "finish_reason": "stop"}], "usage": {"prompt_tokens": 0, "completion_tokens": 438, "total_tokens": 438}, "time": "23.68"}

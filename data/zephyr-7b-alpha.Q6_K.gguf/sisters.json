Since Sally is one of the 4 siblings (including herself), she has 1/4 of the total number of sisters. In other words, Sally has:\n\n(1/4) x (2 sisters) = 0.5 sisters\n\nRounding down to the nearest whole number, Sally has 0 sister(s). However, since Sally also has her own sisters, we need to add those to the total. If Sally has no sisters of her own, then she would indeed have zero sisters overall. But if Sally has one or more sisters, then the answer is:\n\nSally's sisters + Sally's brothers' sisters = ?\n\nLet's say Sally has 2 sisters of her own. Then the total number of sisters that Sally has is:\n\n2 sisters (of Sally's) + 0.5 sisters (from Sally's brothers') = 2.5 sisters\n\nAgain, we round down to get the whole number:\n\nSally has 2 sisters overall.\n\nHowever, if Sally has no sisters of her own, then she would have only the 0.5 sisters from her brothers, which would be rounded down to zero sisters overall."}, "finish_reason": "stop"}], "usage": {"prompt_tokens": 0, "completion_tokens": 279, "total_tokens": 279}, "time": "16.15"}

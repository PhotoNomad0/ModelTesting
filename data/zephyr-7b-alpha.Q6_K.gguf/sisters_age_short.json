Now, let's find out how many years have passed since then: 80 - 6 = 74.\n\n3. To calculate your sister's current age, we need to add the number of years that have passed (74) to her age when you were 6 (x/2).\n\n4. So, your sister's age now is: (x/2) + 74\n\n5. Substitute \"x\" with your age when you were 6 (let's say it was 6):\n\n   (6/2) + 74 = 37 + 74 = 111\n\nSo, your sister is currently 111 years old."}, "finish_reason": "stop"}], "usage": {"prompt_tokens": 0, "completion_tokens": 232, "total_tokens": 232}, "time": "13.84"}

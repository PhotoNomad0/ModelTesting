Let's call Sally's brothers A, B, and C.\n\nA has 2 sisters.\nB has 2 sisters.\nC has 2 sisters.\n\nSo in total, Sally's brothers have 6 sisters (2 for each brother). Since Sally is one of those sisters, she has 1 sister, making a total of 7 sisters among Sally and her brothers. However, we're looking for the number of sisters that Sally has, not including herself. So Sally has 6 sisters (the total number of sisters among her and her brothers) minus 1 (Sally), which gives us 5 sisters.\n\nIn summary, Sally has 5 sisters in total, but she only shares 4 of them with her brothers."}, "finish_reason": "stop"}], "usage": {"prompt_tokens": 0, "completion_tokens": 190, "total_tokens": 190}, "time": "11.02"}

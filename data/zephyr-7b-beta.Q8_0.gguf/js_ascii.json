It then creates a character from the decimal code point using the `String.fromCharCode()` method and outputs both the character and its hexadecimal representation to the console using string concatenation.\n\nNote that this program only generates ASCII characters, which are defined as having decimal values between 0 and 127. If you want to generate Unicode characters with higher code points, you'll need to modify the loop condition and the `String.fromCharCode()` call accordingly."}, "finish_reason": "stop"}], "usage": {"prompt_tokens": 0, "completion_tokens": 337, "total_tokens": 337}, "time": "17.89"}

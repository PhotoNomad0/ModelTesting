Access the localStorage object using window.localStorage.\n2. Set the key-value pair that you want to save by using the setItem() method of the localStorage object. The first argument is the key and the second argument is the value.\n\nHere's an example:\n\n```javascript\n// Save data to localStorage\nlocalStorage.setItem(\"name\", \"John Doe\");\nlocalStorage.setItem(\"age\", 25);\n```\n\nTo read back the saved data, use the getItem() method of the localStorage object. The first argument is the key whose value you want to retrieve.\n\nHere's an example:\n\n```javascript\n// Read data from localStorage\nlet name = localStorage.getItem(\"name\");\nlet age = localStorage.getItem(\"age\");\n\nconsole.log(name); // Output: \"John Doe\"\nconsole.log(age); // Output: \"25\"\n```\n\nYou can also remove an item from localStorage using the removeItem() method, passing the key as an argument. Here's an example:\n\n```javascript\n// Remove an item from localStorage\nlocalStorage.removeItem(\"name\");\n```\n\nTo clear all items from localStorage, use the clear() method of the localStorage object. This will delete all the key-value pairs that are currently stored in localStorage. Here's an example:\n\n```javascript\n// Clear all items from localStorage\nlocalStorage.clear();\n```"}, "finish_reason": "stop"}], "usage": {"prompt_tokens": 0, "completion_tokens": 350, "total_tokens": 350}, "time": "18.28"}

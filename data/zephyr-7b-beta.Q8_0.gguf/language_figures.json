Metaphor - a comparison between two things that are not literally alike, but share some qualities or attributes, expressed without using \"like\" or \"as.\"\n\n2. Simile - a figure of speech that uses \"like\" or \"as\" to compare two things.\n\n3. Personification - giving human qualities or actions to non-human things.\n\n4. Hyperbole - an exaggerated statement that is not meant to be taken literally, used for emphasis.\n\n5. Onomatopoeia - words that imitate the sound they describe, such as \"boom,\" \"hiss,\" and \"splash.\"\n\n6. Alliteration - repetition of consonant sounds at the beginning of words in a phrase or sentence.\n\n7. Synecdoche - using a part to represent the whole or vice versa.\n\n8. Irony - saying one thing but meaning another, often used for dramatic effect.\n\n9. Oxymoron - combining two seemingly contradictory terms, such as \"jumbo shrimp\" or \"deafening silence.\"\n\n10. Aphorism - a statement that expresses a general truth or principle, often in the form of a proverb or maxim."}, "finish_reason": "stop"}], "usage": {"prompt_tokens": 0, "completion_tokens": 291, "total_tokens": 291}, "time": "15.18"}

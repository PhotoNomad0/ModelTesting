The first part states something that is true, while the second part provides additional information or clarification. This literary device is commonly found in ancient Greek and Latin literature, but it can also be used in modern writing to add complexity and depth to language. Some examples of Hendiadys include \"he is rich and wealthy,\" where both \"rich\" and \"wealthy\" convey the idea of financial abundance, or \"she is happy and content,\" where both \"happy\" and \"content\" express a sense of emotional well-being."}, "finish_reason": "stop"}], "usage": {"prompt_tokens": 0, "completion_tokens": 143, "total_tokens": 143}, "time": "7.48"}

It is based on the idea that something can be understood by reference to something else with which it is closely related. For example, \"the White House\" is often used as a metonymy for the U.S. Government or presidency because it is the physical location where important decisions are made and where the President lives and works. Other examples of metonymies include \"the pen is mightier than the sword\" (where \"pen\" represents writing and ideas), \"the grape\" (where \"grape\" represents wine), and \"Wall Street\" (where \"Wall Street\" represents the financial industry)."}, "finish_reason": "stop"}], "usage": {"prompt_tokens": 0, "completion_tokens": 156, "total_tokens": 156}, "time": "8.15"}

Some common types of verbs include:\n\n1. Action verbs: These verbs describe an action being performed, such as \"run,\" \"jump,\" or \"sing.\"\n\n2. Linking verbs: Also known as copula verbs, these verbs connect the subject to a predicate and typically express a state of being, such as \"is,\" \"are,\" or \"was.\"\n\n3. Helping verbs: These auxiliary verbs are used with other verbs in various tenses and aspects, such as \"can,\" \"will,\" or \"do.\"\n\n4. Modal verbs: These auxiliary verbs express possibility, necessity, ability, advice, or permission, such as \"may,\" \"must,\" or \"should.\"\n\n5. Intransitive verbs: These verbs do not take a direct object, such as \"sleep\" or \"laugh.\"\n\n6. Transitive verbs: These verbs take a direct object, such as \"write\" or \"eat.\"\n\n7. Phrasal verbs: These are combinations of a verb and a preposition, such as \"put on,\" \"give up,\" or \"look after.\"\n\n8. Causative verbs: These verbs indicate that one person causes another to perform an action, such as \"make\" or \"help.\"\n\n9. Passive verbs: These are formed by adding the past participle of a verb to a form of the auxiliary \"be,\" indicating that the subject is acted upon rather than acting, such as \"is written\" or \"are played.\"\n\n10. Linking verbs with complements: These linking verbs take a noun phrase or adjective as their complement, such as \"appear,\" \"seem,\" or \"prove.\""}, "finish_reason": "stop"}], "usage": {"prompt_tokens": 0, "completion_tokens": 406, "total_tokens": 406}, "time": "21.21"}

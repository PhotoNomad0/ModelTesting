In this case, the local port 25900 is forwarded to the remote port 5900 (VNC/RDP) on the localhost of the remote machine.\n\nThis allows the user to connect to the remote VNC/RDP session using the forwarded local port instead of connecting directly to the remote EC2 instance, which can improve network performance and security by keeping the connection within the client's network."}, "finish_reason": "stop"}], "usage": {"prompt_tokens": 0, "completion_tokens": 220, "total_tokens": 220}, "time": "11.85"}

Incorrect path to the private key: Make sure that the path to your private key (-i \"~/UserKey.pem\") is correct and matches the location of your actual private key file.\n\n2. Permissions on the private key file: Check the permissions on the private key file (-rwx------ in this case) using the ls -l command. The file should only be readable and writable by the owner (you). If someone else has access to the file, they may also have access to your private key, which could lead to unauthorized access.\n\n3. Incorrect username or EC2 instance ID: Make sure that you are using the correct username for the user on the EC2 instance and that you have specified the correct EC2 instance ID (ec2-34-221-131-108.us-west-2.compute.amazonaws.com).\n\n4. Network connectivity: Make sure that your network connection is stable and that you can ping the EC2 instance from your local machine. If there are any issues with network connectivity, it could prevent you from connecting to the EC2 instance using SSH.\n\n5. Firewall settings: Check the firewall settings on both your local machine and the EC2 instance to ensure that SSH traffic is allowed through. If SSH traffic is blocked by a firewall, you may not be able to connect to the EC2 instance using SSH.\n\n6. Time synchronization: Make sure that the time on your local machine and the EC2 instance are synchronized. If there is a significant difference in time between the two machines, it could cause issues with SSH authentication.\n\n7. Passphrase on private key: If you have set a passphrase on your private key, make sure that you enter the correct passphrase when prompted during the SSH connection process. If you forget the passphrase, you will not be able to connect to the EC2 instance using SSH.\n\nI hope this helps! Let me know if you have any further questions or issues."}, "finish_reason": "stop"}], "usage": {"prompt_tokens": 0, "completion_tokens": 479, "total_tokens": 479}, "time": "25.53"}

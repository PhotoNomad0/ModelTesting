First, let's separate both terms and simplify them:\n   - 8^x = 2^3 * 2^(3x) (by writing 8 as 2^3)\n   - 2^x = 2^(x*3) (by exponentiating 2 to the power of x times 3)\n2. Now, let's substitute these simplified expressions into the original equation:\n   - 2^3 * 2^(3x) + 2^(x*3) = 130\n3. Next, we can combine like terms by separating the exponents and adding them:\n   - 2^(3+x*3) = 130\n4. Now, let's take the logarithm of both sides with base 2 to isolate x:\n   - (3+x*3) * ln(2) = ln(130)\n5. Finally, we can solve for x by dividing both sides by 3 * ln(2):\n   - x = (ln(130) - 3 * ln(2)) / (3 * ln(2))\n6. The result is an approximate value of x:\n   - x ~ 2.548\n\nNote that this solution is approximate because we used logarithms with base 2, which may not be exact due to the limitations of decimal arithmetic. For more accurate results, you can use a calculator or software that supports arbitrary-precision arithmetic."}, "finish_reason": "stop"}], "usage": {"prompt_tokens": 0, "completion_tokens": 376, "total_tokens": 376}, "time": "20.32"}

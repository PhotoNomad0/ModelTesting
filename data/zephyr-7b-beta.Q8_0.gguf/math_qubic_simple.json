Find the coefficients A, B, and C of the cubic polynomial:\n   - A = 1 (since we have x^3)\n   - B = 0 (no x^2 term)\n   - C = -130\n\n2. Calculate the values of Q and R:\n   - Q = (B^2/4) + C = (-100)/4\n   - R = B*C = 0\n\n3. Determine the value of P:\n   - P = A = 1\n\n4. Calculate the real part and imaginary part of the cube root of Q:\n   - Use a calculator or computer to find the three cube roots of Q (there will be one real and two complex). Let's call them r1, r2, and r3.\n\n5. Find the values of x1, x2, and x3 using Cardano's formula:\n   - For the real root:\n     - If R = 0 (in this case), then use:\n       - x1 = r1 + P = r1 + 1\n\n   - For the complex roots:\n     - Use:\n       - x2 = r2 + P + ((2*r2*(P-r3))/(r2-r3))\n       - x3 = r3 + P - ((2*r3*(P-r2))/(r3-r2))\n\nLet's apply these steps to our equation:\n\n1. A = 1, B = 0, C = -130\n\n2. Q = (-100)/4, R = 0\n\n3. P = 1\n\n4. The cube roots of Q are approximately:\n   - r1 = -1.58749\n   - r2 = -0.61803\n   - r3 = -0.61803 (these are complex conjugates)\n\n5. For the real root:\n   - x1 = -1.58749 + 1 = -0.48749\n\n6. For the complex roots:\n   - x2 = -0.61803 + 1 + ((2*-0.61803*(-1-0.61803))/(-0.61803+0.61803)) = 0.54721\n   - x3 = -0.61803 + 1 - ((2*-0.61803*(-1-0.61803))/(-0.61803-0.61803)) = 1.54721\n\nSo, the three roots of x^3+x-130=0 are approximately:\n-0.48749 (real) and 0.54721 \u00b1 0.86602i (complex conjugates)."}, "finish_reason": "stop"}], "usage": {"prompt_tokens": 0, "completion_tokens": 699, "total_tokens": 699}, "time": "37.43"}

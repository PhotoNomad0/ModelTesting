This formula first uses the `CELL()` function to extract the value of the specified cell, then applies the `TRIM()` function to remove any leading or trailing spaces. The `REPLACE()` function is used to replace all single quotes (`) with an empty string (\"\"), and finally, the `SUBSTITUTE()` function removes any remaining space characters at the end of the formula result.\n\nNote: This formula assumes that you want to copy the contents without preserving any formatting or other cell properties. If you need to maintain specific formatting or other attributes, you may need to modify this formula accordingly."}, "finish_reason": "stop"}], "usage": {"prompt_tokens": 0, "completion_tokens": 218, "total_tokens": 218}, "time": "11.37"}

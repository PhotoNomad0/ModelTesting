The curly braces `{}` around this character class indicate that we want to match exactly three occurrences.\n\nTo ensure that the filename extension is \".usfm\", you can add another regex expression at the end of the main expression, using a pipe (`|`) as an OR operator:\n\n`[A-Za-z0-9]{3}-[A-Za-z0-9]{3}(\\.usfm)$`\n\nThis updated expression matches any string that contains three characters followed by a hyphen and another sequence of three characters, followed by the literal string \".usfm\" at the end (indicated by the `$` anchor).\n\nHere's an example usage in Python:\n\n```python\nimport re\n\nfilename = \"57-1Jn.usfm\"\nmatch = re.search(r'[A-Za-z0-9]{3}-[A-Za-z0-9]{3}(\\.usfm)$', filename)\nif match:\n    print(\"Three-character code:\", match.group(0)[0..3])\n```"}, "finish_reason": "stop"}], "usage": {"prompt_tokens": 0, "completion_tokens": 344, "total_tokens": 344}, "time": "18.32"}

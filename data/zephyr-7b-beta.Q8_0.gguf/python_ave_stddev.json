Here's an example:\n\n```python\nimport statistics\nimport math\n\nnumbers = [2, 4, 6, 8, 10]\n\n# Calculate mean (average)\nmean = statistics.mean(numbers)\nprint(\"Mean:\", mean)\n\n# Calculate standard deviation using built-in function\nstd_dev = statistics.stdev(numbers)\nprint(\"Standard Deviation:\", std_dev)\n\n# Alternatively, calculate standard deviation manually using formula\nn = len(numbers)\ntotal = sum(numbers)\nmean = total / n\ndiff_squared = [(x - mean) ** 2 for x in numbers]\nstd_dev_manual = math.sqrt(sum(diff_squared) / (n-1))\nprint(\"Standard Deviation (manually):\", std_dev_manual)\n```\n\nIn this example, we first import the `statistics` and `math` modules. We then define a list of numbers called `numbers`.\n\nTo calculate the mean, we simply call the `mean()` function from the `statistics` module with our list as an argument.\n\nTo calculate the standard deviation using the built-in `stdev()` function, we again pass the list to the function.\n\nAlternatively, you can also calculate the standard deviation manually by first finding the mean (average) of the list, then calculating the square of the difference between each number and the mean, summing these squares, and finally taking the square root of this sum divided by `n-1`. This is the formula for population standard deviation. If you want to use sample standard deviation instead, divide by `n` instead of `n-1`.\n\nIn our example, we calculate the manual standard deviation using a list comprehension and the `math.sqrt()` function. Note that we subtract 1 from the length of the list when calculating the divisor in the formula for population standard deviation."}, "finish_reason": "stop"}], "usage": {"prompt_tokens": 0, "completion_tokens": 493, "total_tokens": 493}, "time": "25.79"}

Here's how you can implement it:\n\n```python\nfrom sympy import symbols, Eq, solve\nx = symbols('x')\na, b, c, d = symbols('a', 'b', 'c', 'd')\neq = a*x**3 + b*x**2 + c*x + d\nroots = solve(eq, x)\nprint(\"All possible values of x are:\")\nfor root in roots:\n    print(root)\n```\n\nReplace `a`, `b`, `c`, and `d` with the corresponding coefficients from your equation. This program will find all possible real and complex roots of the polynomial equation, and print them out. Note that this implementation assumes that you have already defined the coefficients as symbols in Python. If you want to input these coefficients dynamically, you can modify the code accordingly."}, "finish_reason": "stop"}], "usage": {"prompt_tokens": 0, "completion_tokens": 208, "total_tokens": 208}, "time": "11.95"}

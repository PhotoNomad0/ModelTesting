The function takes a list of numbers as its only parameter, named `numbers`.\n2. If the length of the list is less than 2, there is no difference between the largest and smallest number, so we return `None`.\n3. We initialize two variables, `largest` and `smallest`, to the first and last elements of the list, respectively.\n4. We iterate over the remaining elements in the list using a `for` loop.\n5. If the current element is greater than the current value of `largest`, we update `largest`.\n6. If the current element is less than the current value of `smallest`, we update `smallest`.\n7. After iterating over all elements in the list, we return the difference between `largest` and `smallest`."}, "finish_reason": "stop"}], "usage": {"prompt_tokens": 0, "completion_tokens": 301, "total_tokens": 301}, "time": "15.94"}

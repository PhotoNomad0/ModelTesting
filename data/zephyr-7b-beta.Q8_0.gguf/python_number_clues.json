We're using a `for` loop to iterate through all numbers between 20 and 40 (inclusive).\n2. For each number, we first calculate the square root of it using the `math.sqrt()` function.\n3. Then we round the result to the nearest integer using the `round()` function.\n4. Finally, we check if the current number is one more than the squared value of our rounded square root. If yes, then we've found the solution and print it using the `print()` function. We also break out of the loop to avoid further iterations."}, "finish_reason": "stop"}], "usage": {"prompt_tokens": 0, "completion_tokens": 215, "total_tokens": 215}, "time": "11.42"}

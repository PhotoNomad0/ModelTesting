Within the loop, it prints out each record's ID, name, age, and email. Don't forget to replace `mydb.sqlite`, `people`, and `age` with your actual database filename, table name, and column name respectively."}, "finish_reason": "stop"}], "usage": {"prompt_tokens": 0, "completion_tokens": 296, "total_tokens": 296}, "time": "15.47"}

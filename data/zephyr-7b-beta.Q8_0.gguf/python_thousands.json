This allows us to iterate over the digits one by one without having to convert the entire number to a string at once.\n\nNext, we apply the built-in `map()` function with `str()` as its argument to convert each digit back into a string. The resulting list of strings is then passed as an argument to the `join()` function, which combines all the strings using a comma and a space (`, `) as a separator.\n\nFinally, we return the formatted string.\n\nThis implementation has a time complexity of O(n) due to iterating over each digit in the number. However, it should still be reasonably fast for most practical use cases."}, "finish_reason": "stop"}], "usage": {"prompt_tokens": 0, "completion_tokens": 290, "total_tokens": 290}, "time": "15.30"}

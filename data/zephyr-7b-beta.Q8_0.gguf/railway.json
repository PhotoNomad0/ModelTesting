The gauge was chosen primarily for practical reasons related to the construction and operation of steam locomotives.\n\nIn the early days of railway development, there were many different gauges being used, which caused problems with interoperability between different rail networks. This led to a push for standardization in order to facilitate the movement of goods and people more efficiently.\n\nThe first standard gauge was proposed by George Stephenson, a prominent engineer and inventor, who suggested a gauge of 4 feet 8 inches (1,422 millimeters) based on the width of coal wagons used in collieries. However, this gauge proved to be too narrow for steam locomotives, which required more space between the rails to accommodate their larger wheels and greater weight.\n\nAfter some experimentation, Stephenson settled on a gauge of 4 feet 8.5 inches (1,435 millimeters), which he believed would strike a balance between practicality and efficiency. This gauge was first used on the Liverpool and Manchester Railway, which opened in 1830 and is widely regarded as the world's first inter-city railway.\n\nThe success of the Liverpool and Manchester Railway helped to establish the standard gauge as the de facto standard for railways, both in the UK and abroad. Today, the vast majority of rail networks around the world use a gauge of 1,435 millimeters or very close variations thereof."}, "finish_reason": "stop"}], "usage": {"prompt_tokens": 0, "completion_tokens": 357, "total_tokens": 357}, "time": "19.20"}

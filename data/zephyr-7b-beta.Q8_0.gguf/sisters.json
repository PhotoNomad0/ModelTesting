Let's represent this information using variables:\n\n- Sally has 3 brothers: sally's number of brothers = 3 (let's call it x)\n- Each brother has 2 sisters: number of sisters per brother = 2 (let's call it y)\n\nNow, let's find out how many sisters Sally has. Since Sally is one of the daughters, we need to count her sisters and the sisters of her brothers. The total number of sisters in Sally's family is the sum of Sally's sisters and her brothers' sisters:\n\ntotal number of sisters = sally's number of sisters + x * y\n\nLet's substitute the values we know for x and y:\n\ntotal number of sisters = sally's number of sisters + 3 * 2\n\nWe don't know Sally's exact number of sisters, but we can find it by solving this equation for sally's number of sisters. Let's call this variable z:\n\nz = total number of sisters - 3 * 2\n\nSubstituting the expression for the total number of sisters, we get:\n\nz = sally's number of sisters + 3 * 2 - 6\n\nSimplifying:\n\nz = sally's number of sisters - 4\n\nNow we can find Sally's number of sisters by adding 4 to the number of sisters she has:\n\nsally's number of sisters = z + 4\n\nSubstituting our expression for z, we get:\n\nsally's number of sisters = (total number of sisters - 6) + 4\n\nSimplifying:\n\nsally's number of sisters = total number of sisters - 2\n\nSo Sally has the same number of sisters as there are sisters in her entire family, minus two. This makes sense because we know that Sally herself is one of those sisters, so we need to subtract her from the total count."}, "finish_reason": "stop"}], "usage": {"prompt_tokens": 0, "completion_tokens": 465, "total_tokens": 465}, "time": "25.55"}

When you were 6 years old, your sister's age was half of your age at that time. So, when you were 6, your sister's age was:\n\n(6 years old for you) / 2 = (x years old for your sister) / 2\n\nSimplify the equation:\n\n3x = 12\n\nDivide both sides by 3 to find x:\n\nx = 4\n\nYour sister is currently 4 years old.\n\nAlternatively, you can also use a time-line approach. When you were 6, your sister was born. Now, at age 80, you have been alive for 74 more years (80 - 6 = 74). During this time, your sister has grown up to be 4 years old. Therefore, she must have been born when you were 6 - 74 = -68 years old. However, since we cannot have a negative age, we know that your sister's birth year was actually 68 years ago (when you were 6). So, her current age is 4 years old.\n\nI hope this helps clarify the calculation! Let me know if you have any other questions."}, "finish_reason": "stop"}], "usage": {"prompt_tokens": 0, "completion_tokens": 280, "total_tokens": 280}, "time": "15.10"}

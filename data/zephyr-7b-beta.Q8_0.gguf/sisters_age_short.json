Let's call the age of your sister when you were 6 x, and your current age is y. When you were 6, your sister's age was x/2. Now, let's set up an equation to find x:\n\nx/2 = 6 (1)\n\nWhen you are 80, your sister's age is x:\n\ny = 80 (2)\n\nSubstitute y with 80 in equation (1):\n\nx/2 = 6 (3)\n\nMultiply both sides by 2:\n\nx = 12 (4)\n\nSo, your sister's age is now 12."}, "finish_reason": "stop"}], "usage": {"prompt_tokens": 0, "completion_tokens": 182, "total_tokens": 182}, "time": "10.16"}

So, Sally has a total of 3 brothers (her siblings) and 6 sisters (her brothers' siblings), making a total of 9 siblings. Since Sally is one of the siblings, she would have 1 less sibling than the total number of siblings, which means Sally has 8 siblings in total. Therefore, Sally has 3 brothers and 5 sisters, for a total of 8 siblings.\n\nAlternatively, you can also set up an equation to solve this problem:\n\nLet x = the number of sisters Sally has\nLet y = the number of sisters each brother has\nThen, Sally has 3 brothers and a total of x sisters, so the total number of Sally's siblings is 3 brothers + x sisters. Each brother has y sisters, so there are a total of y sisters for all three brothers. The total number of sisters in the family is the sum of Sally's sisters (x) and the sisters of her brothers (3y). Setting up an equation:\n\nNumber of siblings = 3 brothers + x sisters\nNumber of sisters = x + 3y\n\nSubstitute the second equation into the first to eliminate x:\n\nNumber of siblings = 3 brothers + (x + 3y) sisters\n\nSimplify:\n\nNumber of siblings = x sisters + 3y sisters + 3 brothers\n\nSince we want to find out how many sisters Sally has, we can isolate the variable for x by solving for x in terms of y and the total number of siblings:\n\nx = Number of sisters - (3y sisters)\n\nSubstitute the expression for x into the second equation:\n\nNumber of sisters = x + 3y\n\nSimplify:\n\nNumber of sisters = (Number of sisters - 3y) + 3y\n\nCombine like terms:\n\nNumber of sisters = Number of sisters - 3y + 3y\n\nSimplify:\n\nNumber of sisters = Number of sisters\n\nSince this is an identity, it's true for any value of x and y. Therefore, the number of sisters is equal to the total number of sisters in the family. The total number of sisters is given as 6, so there are a total of 6 sisters in the family. Sally has 3 brothers, which leaves us with 3 siblings unaccounted for. Since we know there are a total of 8 siblings, subtracting the 3 brothers and 5 sisters (Sally's siblings) leaves us with zero siblings remaining, so Sally must have the last sister, making her have a total of 8 siblings, which includes 3 brothers and 5 sisters."}, "finish_reason": "stop"}], "usage": {"prompt_tokens": 0, "completion_tokens": 607, "total_tokens": 607}, "time": "32.26"}

// To sort a dictionary by key using JavaScript, you can use the `sort()` method on the array that contains the keys and values. Here's an example code snippet:
//
//
//
// javascriptï¿¼

const myDict = {
  "key1": 10,
  "key2": 20,
  "key3": 30
};

myDict.sort((a, b) => a - b);

console.log(myDict);



//
// This code will create a dictionary with three keys and values, and then use the `sort()` method to sort it based on the difference between each key and its corresponding value. The sorted dictionary will be stored in the `myDict` variable.
//
//     You can also specify the sorting function using the `Comparator` class from the `java.util` package. Here's an example code snippet:
